                            CoinDesk Explainer: Bitcoin Cash and Why It's Forking the Blockchain                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-explainer-bitcoin-cash-forking-blockchain/,"Bitcoin's scaling debate finally seems to be shaking out, but one small group of users isn't happy with the results. After a few years of debate, it was perhaps to be expected that at least some were going to come away empty-handed. Controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x tried to remedy this by joining two code change ideas – the code optimization Segregated Witness (SegWit) and a block size increase. Today, SegWit is just a couple of steps away from activating on bitcoin, but some bitcoin users are unhappy about the outcome. Others who originally backed the Segwit2x proposal appear to be losing confidence in an eventual block size increase and are now taking matters into their own hands by making their own version of bitcoin – and they're doing so on a short timeline. On August 1, at precisely 12:20 UTC, the group claims that they will split off from bitcoin, creating a new cryptocurrency called Bitcoin Cash. Developer Calin Culianu, who's contributing code to an implementation of Bitcoin Cash, is one user who doesn't like SegWit, suspecting that others feel the same way. Culianu told CoinDesk: So, what is it? And how does it differ from bitcoin? Bitcoin Cash works slightly differently than the bitcoin software that most users run today. There are two main changes of note: Some, including a few of the project's supporters, call Bitcoin Cash an ""altcoin,"" a term that usually denotes a fork of the software that creates a new cryptocurrency, with its own market. Indeed, the cryptocurrency is currently trading at $461, meaning it's worth about 18% of bitcoin's current price of $2,568. Unlike other altcoins, though, Bitcoin Cash's transaction history is the same as bitcoin's – at least up until the point of the split. So, if and when Bitcoin Cash splits off, users will have bitcoin on both blockchains. Another difference is the project aims to support multiple implementations of its software, a move that's not surprising given the criticism that Bitcoin Core's software is too dominant on the bitcoin network. BitcoinABC is the first software to implement the Bitcoin Cash protocol, but the goal is for there to be many implementations. Culianu said that both Bitcoin Unlimited and Bitcoin Classic, other implementations that aim to increase bitcoin’s block size, are working on a version compatible with Bitcoin Cash. These might or might not be ready for August 1. So far, most bitcoin companies, mining pools, users and bitcoin developers seem uninterested in the effort. Yet, there are some eager supporters. Beijing-based mining firm ViaBTC, which boasts roughly 4% of bitcoin’s computing power, is the clear ringleader. The firm, which also operates an exchange, has become the first to list the cryptocurrency and also has plans to launch a new mining pool dedicated solely to Bitcoin Cash. (Though, so far, it’s not clear how much of its 4% mining hashrate it will commit to the effort.) Asked if he believed Segwit2x would fulfill its roadmap, CEO Haipo Yang responded: ""I doubt it."" Further, Bitcoin Cash has attracted support from some users who support a block size increase, as well as developers of other proposals such as Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited. What might be more surprising, though, is who's not involved. Even former supporters, including mining firms Bitcoin.com and Bitmain, seem hesitant to back the effort. For now, they remain committed to controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x. Mining company Bitmain even inspired Bitcoin Cash. Yet, the firm said that they only planned on going through with making the switch under certain conditions. Still, the firm might support both Segwit2x and Bitcoin Cash in the future. In a PSA statement, Bitcoin.com said that it will allow miners in its pool to choose if they want to mine the Bitcoin Cash token BCC. For now, though, it will mine on Segwit2x chain, though it said it ""will immediately shift all company resources to supporting Bitcoin Cash exclusively"" if the block size increase part of SegWit, scheduled for roughly three months from now, falls through. There are a few reasons users and mining pools might like to break off from bitcoin: This mix of ideological and technical reasons was also on display in conversations with users. When asked by CoinDesk what BitcoinABC's goal is, Culianu responded: Many other efforts over the last couple of years have said they would split off from bitcoin, if they gained enough support from those operating the computers that secure the network. But, to date, no group has actually carried through with this plan so far. Bitcoin Cash might be unique in that it’s actually committing to a deadline to split bitcoin into two, and that deadline is less than a week away. If miners and users indeed go ahead with the split, it would mark the first time a cryptocurrency split off from bitcoin, carrying with it bitcoin’s transaction history. Like past efforts intended to replace the bitcoin used today with a new bitcoin, however, Bitcoin Cash has the same goal, but it seems willing to wait and see if users join the effort. Rather than call it bitcoin, ViaBTC, as well as a group of bitcoin companies in China, signed an agreement to label it a ""competitive currency,"" not the ""real"" bitcoin. The move could set up the split to happen more quickly, as in the past exchanges have expressed confusion over how to handle a fork. If a new cryptocurrency splits off from the main bitcoin network, it will mark a first. So, some users are curious to see what happens. Still, without much support from miners and users, it might not end up having that much of an impact on the course of the main network. Nonetheless, it might if be worth watching if the second half of Segwit2x falls through. That's when it might see some more supporters. Culianu, for example, concluded on an optimistic note: Bitcoin voucher image via CoinDesk archives

Senior White House advisor Jared Kushner submitted a statement on Monday ahead of a meeting with members of the US Senate, who are investigating whether the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election. Kushner, a New York real estate scion who is also married to Trump's daughter, Ivanka, flatly denied that the allegations against him and the campaign. Kushner's statement contained a notable aside, dating back to the end of October, when he is said to have received an email from someone using the moniker ""Guccifer400"" – a reference to the Romanian hacker who infiltrated the email accounts of several US and Romanian officials, among others. The person, according to Kushner, threatened to publish information regarding Trump's tax returns – a subject of interest during the campaign given that he was the sole candidate to opt not to release his returns – unless Kushner paid 52 bitcoins, an amount worth roughly $37,000 at then-current prices. Despite passing along the threat to the Secret Service, Kushner explained, nothing ultimately came of it. ""I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all travelling [sic] on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply -- which is what I did,"" he wrote. ""The sender never contacted me again."" Image Credit: Conecta Abogados / Flickr

As profiled by Business Insider, the movement is in line with Jafari's earlier analysis, reported on June 13, when she suggested the price would temporarily drop below $2,000, only to then turn bullish. Indeed, since surpassing its all-time high over $3,000 on June 12, the bitcoin price tumbled to as low as $1,836 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Shortly thereafter, it hit a one-month high across major exchanges amid progress on its technical roadmap. With this much foreseen, Jafari now believes the price of bitcoin is in for a period of fluctuation, at least until a new wave of price growth begins. ""Anything above 3,000 (June 13th high) will suggest potential to have already started wave V, which again has a minimum target at 2,988 and scope to reach 3,691,"" Jafari wrote in the note.

According to Business Insider, the Melbourne-based Bitcoin.com.au received the funds from Alium Cpital and Dominet Venture Partners. The new funding will be used to expand the startup's overseas operations in the UK and Canada. Founder and chief executive Rupert Hackett told the publication that the funding would also fuel the integration of other cryptocurrencies, including ethereum and XRP. Bitcoin.com.au offers both online and physical bitcoin exchange services in Australia, in partnership with domestic retailers financial firms. The report suggests that the final raise amount was higher than originally planned, as the startup had intended to raise $500k to support its efforts. In statements, Alium Capital partner Rajeev Gupta suggested that the investment would help his firm gain further exposure to the burgeoning cryptocurrency space. ""We believe Rupert and the team at Bitcoin.com.au provide a platform that is a pure play 21st century asset class for digital cryptocurrencies in Australia,"" he said. The new funding follows moves by Australian regulators to improve conditions for startups working with digital currencies, especially a decision earlier this year to finally remove a much-maligned ""double tax"" on bitcoin purchases. As reported earlier this year, the Australian Treasury has eliminated a goods-and-services tax on bitcoin purchases, an act that the Australian government noted will foster digital currency business development in the country.

                            American Express Brings Credit Card Buying to Bitcoin App Abra                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/american-express-brings-credit-card-buying-bitcoin-app-abra/,"Beginning today, a select group of Abra users and new customers will see the option to buy bitcoin with their American Express card. The months-long integration process between the two companies involved Abra exposing the depths of its business processes to its partner and investor, and has resulted in an even closer relationship between the firms. Still, Abra founder and CEO Bill Barhydt believes the end result of that effort could be a rapid acceleration of bitcoin adoption globally. Barhydt told CoinDesk: This means users whose American Express purchase option is enabled today can now purchase up to $200 worth of bitcoin per day, and up to $1,000 of bitcoin per month for a 4 percent fee. Designed to cover Abra's own costs, Barhydt said the startup doesn't expect to generate any revenue from the fees, but will rather earn its share from managing the exchange rates between US dollars and bitcoin. American Express spokesperson Elizabeth Crosta clarified that while Abra’s customers are now able to fund their wallets with American Express Abra is not processing the transaction. But it's perhaps the scale of what was needed to make this feature a reality that is most notable. In the weeks leading up to today's launch, Abra employees, American Express staff and Abra investors have been testing the integration, Barhydt said. In spite of the tests though, the remaining Abra customers won't receive permission to conduct American Express purchases until initial users safely complete purchases. ""There are some potentially unsavory folks in our universe,"" said Barhydt. ""And we want to make sure we're servicing the people whose intentions are good, and not the other folks."" Eligible cards include American Express US consumer cards, American Express-branded cards issued by third parties and American Express re-loadable prepaid cards, Bluebird and American Express Serve, which can be purchased at Walmart, CVS, Walgreens and more. ""Anybody who shops at Walmart can walk into a Walmart store anywhere in the country, buy a Bluebird card at check-out, put all the money they need to on that card, register that card, and once the card arrives at their home, they can immediately load those funds into their Abra app,"" Barhydt said.  To pull off the months-long project, Barhydt said the two companies invested ""significant"" resources integrating on a technical level to ensure satisfactory security on both sides of the deal. In particular, Barhydt said his firm was asked to reveal how it works with exchange partners, as well as its know-your-customer process. After raising $14m venture capital from American Express Ventures and others, Abra now lets its customer store funds in both bitcoin and fiat currency with support from banks including Bank of America, Capital One, and Chase, along with credit unions from Charles Schwab, Fidelity, and Wells Fargo. But Abra too had its own concerns about American Express’s KYC practices. As result, the ""instant issue"" capability of some reloadable cards has been disabled. Instead of being able to add cash to a card and spend it immediately, customers will have to have to go through extra steps to connect their identity to the funds. ""You will have to register the card with American Express and wait for the fully registered card to arrive in the mail,"" said Barhydt. Still, Barhydt believes the work is worth it. In interview, he cited American Express's brand credibility as among the reasons the partnership is a boon for not only his company, but for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies generally. But there's little doubt the potential benefits could go both ways. As American Express competitors Visa and Mastercard each begin testing the waters with blockchain, the Abra partnership also signifies an industry-wide search for increased efficiency and speed that the technology could bring. But while both parties potentially stand to gain from the partnership, neither is depending exclusively on the other. In January, American Express joined blockchain consortium Hyperledger, which is exploring ways to capitalize on the technology without cryptocurrency at all. Further, Abra itself is excited about what the partnership could mean for blazing trails with other credit card companies, even even among it's own bitcoin payments competitors. ""Having a traditional card network partner directly with a company directly in the cryptocurrency world is a huge win for the space, and it’s been a long time coming,"" said Barhydt, who concluded: American Express image via Shutterstock Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra.

                            What's Left Before SegWit Goes Live? Bitcoin's Path to More Capacity                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/whats-left-before-segwit-goes-live-bitcoins-path-more-capacity/,"Bitcoin is on the road to increasing its capacity – but it's not there yet. Despite the claim bitcoin has been upgraded to support Segregated Witness-style transactions, there are more steps that need to occur before its distributed network can process additional data. In fact, due to the complexities of keeping bitcoin's distributed network in unison, the change might not take hold until late August. That said, with BIP 91 activated, bitcoin is now headed down a path toward that possible outcome. In context, this means that BIP 148, a proposal that seeks to upgrade the network to SegWit using different code, is no longer likely (though it's still possible). As such, one avenue that would find bitcoin splitting into two blockchains has been diminished, though it would be wrong to say it has been eliminated entirely – even in the short term. Rather, SegWit now needs to follow a timeline designed to give miners and node operators ample time to upgrade their software, one that must also operate within the larger constraints of bitcoin's design. Here's a best-case scenario of how this might unfold:  As illustrated above, miners must now signal support for SegWit until the code achieves ""lock in"" and ""activation,"" two separate milestones with unique requirements. Still, things could go awry. For example, it's possible that bitcoin's miners could stop signaling support for SegWit ahead of the BIP 141 ""lock in"" deadline (although they'd risk having their blocks rejected by the network, losing the rewards). While all nodes appear to be signaling correctly, it's hard to know exactly who is running the software – this means that miners could fail to reject a block that wasn't signaling for SegWit, continue adding new blocks on top of that block, and ultimately, produce an alternative chain. Adding to the argument is that miner support for the idea has notably wavered in the past, with some asserting it's largely the threat that users could push through a change that could lead to a split that has kept miners in check. Litecoin's attempts at integrating SegWit adds context to this theory. As much as 75% of litecoin's mining hashrate, for instance, was signaling for SegWit in April, meaning it reached the necessary threshold to lock in SegWit. But miner support dropped off soon after. This sparked protocol creator Charlie Lee and other litecoin users to threaten to code an alternative user-activated soft fork (UASF) proposal. Shortly thereafter, a roundtable was held that united major miners, at which time they agreed to signal support for SegWit. Should similar psychology come into play here, the idea is that (after averting a UASF on bitcoin on August 1), miner support for SegWit may wane, though the economic stakes here are arguably higher. But even if SegWit passes, that still only enacts one-half of the Segwit2x proposal. An informal agreement among businesses and miners reached in May, the goal of the initiative was to push the capabilities of the software even further (some would argue too far beyond what should be advocated by prudent development). As developer Jeff Garzik put forward in an interview this weekend, he still plans to help push forward an effort that would seek to upgrade the block size to 2MB, and to enact the upgrade via a process known as a hard fork. The argument against that approach is that research in this area is still underdeveloped, though Garzik has argued SegWit could fail to introduce the capacity changes promised by those who have championed its integration. This determination (as well as the acrimony Garzik's outlook has caused in the developer community that argue this claim and others he's made are false) could make a split later in the year more likely. And it's quite possible this chart will become more complex as this date approaches and different groups attempt to influence the outcome.

In the report, Blanch opines that a watershed moment would come should banks begin taking bitcoin as a form of collateral for products. While this represents a ""crucial hurdle,"" he went on to say that ""we are not aware of any major institution that takes cryptocurrency as collateral at the moment."" Blanch drew a comparison between bitcoin and commodities such as gold and silver, noting that, in the past year, volatility in bitcoin markets was seen to fall below levels witnessed in markets for the latter precious metal. ""Bitcoin's volatility is very high compared to the euro, the yen or even gold,"" he wrote, according to CNBC.

                            Bitcoin Investment Firm Launches Ethereum-Subscribed ICO Fund                        ",Ash Bennington,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hedge-fund-launches-ethereum-subscribed-ico-investment-vehicle/,"The operators of a regulated, Jersey-based bitcoin fund have officially closed a new $5 million fund aimed at investing in cryptocurrency tokens and initial coin offerings (ICOs). Backed by fund manager and former JP Morgan trader Daniel Masters, the offering by Global Advisors is the latest in a string of funds aimed at offering accredited investors exposure to the burgeoning crypto asset class. However, it may be unique in that those who committed investment funds did so in ether, the native cryptocurrency on the ethereum blockchain. Speaking exclusively to CoinDesk, chairman Daniel Masters stressed this detail as the fund's defining attribute. Masters said: In statements, Masters added that key selling points for the fund would be its ""discretion and caution"" at a time of ample innovation.  As such, the fund is structured to offer managed exposure to the emerging space, allowing investors to participate ""cautiously and intelligently."" Elsewhere in conversation, Masters gave an additional assessment of the ICO investment landscape. In his view, the ecosystem began diversifying in May 2017, spurred by the publicity for major ransomware attacks, which he cited as driving demand for cryptocurrency payments to the point of a breakout rally.  ""Bitcoin was underperforming but was being pulled higher as the whole cryptocurrency complex exploded upward,"" Masters said. During this time period, bitcoin saw its percentage of the total cryptocurrency market cap collapse, falling from above 90% to below 50% as investors sought exposure in less established areas of the market. In particular, Masters said interest was driven to ethereum.  ""In a nutshell, we concluded that ethereum, and the ERC-20 tokens it spawned, were a really significant innovation in digital assets,"" he said, adding: From there, Masters formulated what makes for a strong ICO. (Already, his firm has directly invested in a token sale for Aventus.) First, it calls for a team of experienced, motivated and technically savvy founders. Second, the ICO must solve a real-world problem in a way that cannot be done without the use of blockchain technology. Third, the solution should have a strong enough network effect so that its code can't be easily copied into a possible competitor. If you have those three elements in place, according to Masters, issuing an ethereum-based token may make sense. ""We've seen debt coins, equity coins and rail coins, which purports to transfer another coin across the ecosystem. I don't think any of those spaces are promising. What I do think are promising are new protocol coins,"" he explained. According to Masters, token offerings and ICOs offer powerful economic incentives to entrepreneurs who are able to effectively exploit the technology. ""It enables small- to medium-sized technology companies to leapfrog years of efforts in the management of their capital structure. You can go from a friends and family round to an angel round to Series A, to Series B, and even arguably Series C  in one go,"" he said. From the perspective of the investor, Masters said, the lure of ICOs can also prove quite powerful. ""You probably have liquidity within one week of your investment,"" he said. On the other hand, the risks to individual investors who jump into the ICO space by themselves can also be quite significant, he said, framing this as a value-add for the fund. He concluded: Daniel Masters image via Vimeo

                            Think Bitcoin Is Small Business? Bitfury Is Making Almost $100 Million Annually                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/think-bitcoin-small-business-bitfury-making-almost-100-million-annually/,"The myth that blockchain industry startups don't make money has been largely shattered by investor documents that show Bitfury Group is generating revenue that would make it competitive against more mainstream companies. Founded in 2011, the venture-backed startup that started as a bitcoin mining operation, and that has since expanded to offer other software services, generated $93.7 million revenue in fiscal year 2017 according to the documents obtained by CoinDesk. In total, this was a 70 percent increase year-over-year. Of that revenue, earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) were $24.7 million based on a 26 percent margin. The firm – based in Amsterdam with offices in San Fransisco, Washington, DC, Riga, Latvia and Hong Kong – has already raised more than $100 million in venture capital, according to the documents, about $10 million more than the previously known number. When those numbers are compared to revenue from venture-backed startups with similar numbers, Bitfury Group fits in with some recognizable names across more mainstream industries. Last year, small business loan startup Kabbage generated a bit more than Bitfury Group with $97.4 million in revenue, but raised significantly higher equity funding with $239 million, according to the most recent Inc 500 list. Software company Yext, which went public earlier this year, actually generated less revenue than Bitfury Group, with $89 million after raising about $117 million. In addition to Bitfury Group's revenue generated by bitcoin transaction fees, the company also lists a total of 500,000 bitcoins ""generated to date"" from the protocol's block rewards. At today’s prices of about $2,600, that would amount to $13 billion earned from mining, though there is evidence some of those bitcoins have been sold. To give an idea of how Bitfury Group's mining operations compare to the overall bitcoin network, the company listed a 9 percent market share in March 2016 compared to an 11 percent share a year later. For comparison, documents reveal the only miners with a larger market share are Bitmain, with 19 percent and F2Pool with 12 percent. The materials, which appear to be part of an effort to raise additional capital, also include numerous forecasts for the company’s own growth, as well as that of the entire industry. Notably, by the year 2021, Bitfury Group predicts it will be generating $585 million in revenue. Of that, $302 million (52 percent) is expected to come from transaction fees ($163 million) and mining rewards ($139 million); $217 million (37 percent) is expected to come from third-party infrastructure solutions including its Blockbox mining unit; and $66 million (11 percent) from b2b services, including its newly revealed Exonum enterprise grade blockchain. But it's the total market for bitcoin transaction fees that appears to be BitFury Group's most enticing business vertical. Described as a ""vast opportunity,"" it predicts $37 billion in transaction fees will be generated by the next reward ""halving."" At least as far back as 2014, Bitfury Group co-founder Valery Vavilov has been working diligently to change the perception that his company was not a ""mining"" company. In an early interview with CoinDesk, Vavilov went so far as to make this declaration, preferring instead to focus his efforts on ""fields of knowledge where humanity needs a lot of computing power."" Nearly three years later, the investor deck appears to confirm that this transition has been successful. Since that 2014 interview, Bitfury Group has grown to 250 employees, up from 70, according to Vavilov. He also cited the company's role in helping create The Global Blockchain Business Council, The Blockchain Trust Accelerator and the Blockchain Summit, currently underway, as evidence of its broader mission. ""These are early days in blockchain, and we believe the future of bitcoin and the entire blockchain ecosystem shines bright,” Vavilov said. As part of that broader scope, Bitfury Group has migrated much of the bitcoin mining wording to another website, giving the Bitfury Group domain a much more enterprise-driven appearance. The investor documents support that broader work by painting a picture of a much more ""holistic business strategy"" than one would expect from a pure mining operation. While mining chips still make up a significant portion of the strategy (and indeed the revenue) going forward, the documents also describe a ""full envisioned product portfolio"" built around software licenses for the Exonum enterprise blockchain and other unannounced efforts.

As reported last month by CoinDesk, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu signed HB 436 on June 2, which excludes ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"" from the state's money services rules. The measure was first introduced in January. According to the text of the bill, which was finalized in late April, the new rules take place on August 1, or next Tuesday. The measure won plaudits from the state's bitcoin community, though state officials, including those from its chief financial regulator, blasted the then-proposed law in hearings before the legislature. The bill was sponsored by Rep. Barbara Biggie, with Rep. Keith Ammon co-sponsoring the measure. When it came time for votes, both the House of Representatives as well as the Senate displayed a somewhat divided view on the bill, clearing it by votes of 185-170 and 13-10, respectively. Ultimately, the new rules highlight how New Hampshire has taken a largely different approach to its regulation of digital currencies. Other states, from New Hampshire to Washington, have opted for tighter controls on those who trade or handle digital currencies on behalf of customers. New Hampshire map image via Shutterstock

According to regional news source Balkan Insight, the ATM is expected to be placed in the center of Pristina, the country's capital city. Operated by IT systems firm Albvision Ltd, the machine will support transactions in bitcoin, and soon, 10 other cryptocurrencies. The firm also has bitcoin ATMs planned for cities in two other Balkan countries: Tirana in Albania, and Skopje in the Republic of Macedonia. Still, the decision to launch the unit has attracted attention from the country's financial regulators, who stressed that cryptocurrencies are lacking consumer protections due to a lack of local regulation. ""We inform all potential virtual money users that in the Republic of Kosovo there is no institution guaranteeing the reimbursement of money that is lost,"" a statement from the Kosovo Central Bank noted. Meanwhile, technology enthusiasts are coming to the defense. In separate statements to the media, they're arguing a better way to mitigate threats is through educating the public and expediting the country's regulatory classification of the technology. ""The risk is the same; a user can lose money if they do not know how to use it. But this ATM will create possibilities for bitcoin to have more users. The biggest risk is not knowing how to use it,"" said Valmir Hazeri, chief operations officer of a local bitcoin company Bitsapphire. Hazeri went on to call for local regulators to take steps to open the conversation about possible legal accommodations for the industry. Kosovo image via Shutterstock

                            What Coinbase's Cuba Problem Says About the Bitcoin Business                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/coinbases-cuba-problem-says-bitcoin-business/,"As travelers to Cuba can attest, an unfortunate reality of cryptocurrency services today is often the poor customer support. After taking a vacation to the Caribbean island, Elliott Smith, a visual effects programmer from the UK, was sitting at the airport and, as is common after vacation, began catching up on his digital life. With a keen interest in bitcoin, Smith decided to open the Coinbase app and check the price of his holdings. After a quick look, he closed the app. He didn't buy. He didn't sell. He didn't trade. And yet, when he got back home, he saw a disheartening message when he tried to login again:  According to Drew Hinkes, a partner at Berger Singerman, Coinbase's action was not particularly surprising given that the country is still subject to financial sanctions by the U.S. ""The fact that we've opened up some tourism and widened the pipes may have suggested to folks traveling there that the full spectrum of economic activity was available,"" Hinkes said. But just like Iran, Syria and North Korea, Cuba remains not fully in the good graces of the U.S. Hinkes told CoinDesk: Hinkes refers to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, an office which comprises several agencies that have engaged the digital currency community. Plus, Coinbase has already proven itself highly conservative in its approach to compliance, recently ousting a white-hat hacker for paying ransoms and buying black market documents at the behest of clients. ""Coinbase has taken great pains to stay in the good graces of regulators,"" Hinkes said. Although, companies can get licenses to do business in the country, and Netflix and Airbnb are examples of U.S. companies that received a license. The others aren't allowed to provide services for people that live in the country. But, Smith doesn't live in Cuba. And he told Coinbase as much, detailing the issue to their support team on May 22. Two days later, Smith received a response from a member of Coinbase’s support team, stating: Since then, even with a half a dozen requests for updates, Smith hasn't heard a thing. And his story isn’t unique. On Reddit, a handful of people have lamented the same situation, including Charles Thomson, who has taken the issue further. Thomson continued to ask Coinbase to release his funds, but with no digital response, he stepped it up to a formal demand by registered mail. On June 15, after Coinbase failed to meet the deadline set in the demand, Thomson filed a lawsuit. According to Thomson, the lawsuit is less about money, and more about forcing Coinbase to fix the problem. ""Everybody else that doesn't have the means to bring a lawsuit against them, Coinbase is just ignoring – unless they’re threatened, it seems, at least with legal action,” said Smith, who didn't have much bitcoin in the account when it was closed. The problem, then, is more of principle. Smith contended: ""I knew there would be a backlog, so I gave them a few weeks, but this is really frustrating,"" he continued. Coinbase agrees. Daniel Romero, senior vice president of operations at the firm, told CoinDesk: According to Romero, Coinbase has seen a 10-fold increase in the number of customers using the platform. But Romero says the company is working on it. In a June 2 Medium post, Coinbase co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong, outlined how the company would be addressing the situation in Q3 of this year. Coinbase is committing significant investment toward customer service, for instance, working with an outsourced team to double support capacity and hiring a consultant to help the company scale and introduce phone support. The goal is to take care of support requests in six hours or less, said Romero. ""Compliance-related requests are always going to take us a little more time because we need to look at the account and make a judgement, and we're pretty thorough when were doing anything related to compliance,"" Romero said. While Romero wouldn't speak to specific cases, he added Coinbase plans on doubling the support team again in the next six to eight weeks. This isn't only a Coinbase problem, though. Perusing cryptocurrency company's Twitter feeds (Poloniex, for example) reveals a significant amount of frustration related to support. The result is that tensions between companies and users are still high. Even with his account reopened, Thomson has kept the lawsuit against Coinbase pending. ""I have quite a bit of experience with filing these types of lawsuits, and the same thing always happens when a company gets the plaintiff’s claim and the order to go to court, they immediately pick up the phone and try to make you go away,” he said on Reddit. Thomson has continued encouraging others to give him their support case numbers, so when Coinbase calls he can give support all the cases, and hopefully get everyone’s accounts reopened (including those of his girlfriend and a friend who traveled with him to Cuba). Five days after he filed the lawsuit, Coinbase reopened Thomson's account. But they had only emailed him a confirmation. He posted on Reddit that, because he didn't end up on the phone with anyone at Coinbase, he was unable to ask about other's case numbers. On July 19, Thomson posted on Reddit an email he received from Coinbase that stated the exchange would like Thomson to withdraw the filing because access was fully restored to his account. The best part: It was sent and signed by Coinbase corporate counsel Shahab Asghar, a real person. Thomson expects to get on the phone with Asghar soon, asking about all the other’s case numbers who have dealt with the same issue. In Thomson's words: ""The end is near.""

                            Between a Rock and a Hard Fork: Jeff Garzik's Plan to Avoid a Bitcoin Split                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/rock-hard-fork-jeff-garziks-plan-avoid-bitcoin-split/,"Jeff Garzik has been accused of a lot of things of late. Since taking the lead on turning the Segwit2x scaling agreement into code, the CEO of blockchain startup Bloq has been accused of everything from closing off bitcoin's open-source development to encouraging unnecessarily aggressive network changes to playing loose with facts to sway public sentiment on the plan. But if the long-time developer, one of the first employed by a startup to work directly with bitcoin's underlying software, has emerged as a lightning rod, Garzik seems enthusiastic about the role. Fond of taking on critics head on in lengthy Twitter exchanges, Garzik may be unique among bitcoin developers in displaying a largely take-charge entrepreneurial mindset, one that finds him at odds with the project's more security-conscious developer group, Bitcoin Core. But if Garzik is under scrutiny now, he's likely to be there for some time.  While there are a few steps left before bitcoin’s long-awaited capacity upgrade is a done deal (it's looking increasingly likely that bitcoin miners will push a scaling upgrade by the end of August), the code changes he's shepherding aren't due to conclude until the fall. That's when they'll perhaps hit a fever pitch that dwarfs the current debate, and in a new interview, Garzik doubled down on his intent to introduce the code for a hard fork that would further boost the network's capabilities while putting it again on a path to a split. Against this backdrop, Garzik sat down with CoinDesk to discuss his thoughts on the future of Segwit2x, addressing the key questions and controversies that have been bubbling behind the scenes of late. Below, that interview is reproduced, though some of Garzik's comments have been shortened for clarity. Mining pools started signaling for BIP 91 earlier than expected this week – why given that they've been reluctant about SegWit in the past?  They were chomping in the bit. One of the completely ridiculous narratives out there is that mining pools are blocking SegWit and don't want SegWit for various reasons. In real life, they're chomping at the bit to activate SegWit. They're really ready to plunge and take the plunge to step two in scaling, which is raising the block size. They were ready to pull the trigger as soon as everyone could get their nodes spun up. Didn't the original deployment of SegWit stall because of lack of mining pool support? Well, it was more than just miners. That's the thing about Segwit2x. SegWit wasn’t going to increase the block size at a speed that was realistic to a lot of the players in the space. By itself, it's a two-step upgrade. First you upgrade the nodes to support those new rules, then you have a year-long process of updating the wallets. Upgrading the wallets, that second step, is where SegWit actually brings new capacity. After this long, contentious debate, a SegWit-only path would only leave us with only the same capacity that we have now. That's why it stalled. And why Segwit2x moves that needle forward. It delivers guaranteed short-term capacity. That's the base block size increase. And it sets the foundation for the long-term, and that's SegWit. Mining pools are already running the code. Is it safe for them to do so even if the final release isn't out? Absolutely. The consensus rules have not been changed. Those are the security rules changed across the entire network. We'll release the final version when it's ready. If there are bugs, we’ll have a second, third, or even fourth release candidate. It’s released when it's ready. There are never guarantees with software. Segwit2x introduces SegWit code to the network, but you've been critical of SegWit in the past, or at least soft forks. Did you change your mind in support of Segwit2x? Nope. Basically what happens with Segwit2x is there's a short, interim soft fork and a hard fork that locks in those SegWit rules. It locks in in a way in a A or B way. That's what a hard fork does that a soft fork doesn't. It gives users a choice to follow the chain or not. But with a soft fork, all rules are already accepted by all rules in a soft fork. You can imagine many different situations where you don’t want to automatically accept new rules. A hard fork is different in that the network doesn't automatically accept the new rules. I've been a proponent of SegWit as a hard fork, because you lock in those rules in a way that people endorse those rules or not. That's the outcome of Segwit2x. Post-hard fork, the SegWit rules are locked in. Segwit2x is most likely to result in one coin, whereas a big block hard fork or just a SegWit upgrade was stuck at 30% hashrate and no consensus from economic nodes. You have SegWit-only, Bitcoin Core supporters. Then you have partisans on the other side – the we need big blocks, Bitcoin Unlimited, etc. Neither of those were getting full traction in the market. It got to 30% and then got stuck. The community was just at this gridlock stage. Segwit2x at a high-level attempts to move past that gridlock, moves past the communities are stuck in a way that results in one coin that doesn’t result in a chain split. That riles up people in the big blocker community as well as some of the people in the SegWit-only, Bitcoin Core community. But there’s a lot of support for it and it’s getting rolled out on the network right now because Segwit2x is, ironically, the fastest path for activating SegWit. Many in the community have criticised Segwit2x for its closed development process. That's pretty typical of the mud slung by Peter Todd and Adam Back specifically. It's not true at all. The GitHub is completely open, the mailing list completely open. All the feedback that's been received has been thoughtfully addressed. The feedback that we've received from Bitcoin Core to date has largely been make-this-change-that-breaks-all-of-the-wallets-type changes, signaling the hard fork in a different way, or just a disruptive, trolling GitHub comments. There’s all sorts of mud being slung. There are some people who don’t like things being done in the way they wouldn't have done them. The main criticism that comes up is the 2 MB hard fork. Some developers think that it could be done in a safer way or think that the three-month timeline is too fast. This gets into the weeds of the scaling debate. Those are criticisms from people who have delayed planning a hard fork for years. That's really why supporters of Segwit2x wants to move on. They didn't get more than 30% traction. SegWit is a great technology, but it's not very good at delivering capacity. Capacity, high transaction speed – and the proposal proposes to extend a years-long delay with another years-long delay as SegWit capacity ramps up. That’s the core at that disagreement. Folks who’ve failed to plan for a hard fork who’ve thrown shade on all hard forks are throwing more shade on this one. That’s entirely expected. That’s part of the process of reaching across the isle and bringing these two camps together. It’s no surprise that the democrats in bitcoin don’t like the republicans in bitcoin. It seems like some are completely opposed to a hard fork, but some developers think that the timeline should extended to a year instead of three months. I'll disagree with that. If you go through the Twitter history, they've been saying that for years. There's never enough time for a hard fork, yet that planning never happens. The community has lost patience with that message. There's no outcome other than delay. Will Segwit2x add replay protection in the case of a hard fork?  Definitely. There have been a few proposals. One was proposed by a Bitcoin Core contributor. That replay protection would break every wallet, so we view that as a non-serious, disruptive proposal. The other proposal was from [former lead bitcoin maintainer] Gavin Andresen. Others have proposed forms of opt-in replay protection. That’s definitely something we’re looking into, but we’re not interested in breaking all wallets. There is a contingent of bitcoin users who disagree with the hard fork aspect of Segwit2x. Will that impact whether it succeeds? That's actually why I think that hard forks are better than soft forks. With soft forks you're automatically accepting the new rules. If you disagree with a hard fork, then you do not automatically accept the new rules. From a governance perspective, that’s very, very healthy. To answer your question, that won’t disrupt the hard fork. Furthermore, it’s a good thing that people can disagree with the hard fork. Disagreement and freedom of choice is great and it’s what makes bitcoin great. Do you think that could lead to a split then? I do. My predicted outcome, as we’re seeing right now, is that the miners are adopting the BTC1 software. And that leaves the vast majority of mining software on one coin. By definition, a minority chain behaves in a certain way. If a large amount of the hashpower splits away from the chain or in a UASF scenario, where many users run away from the hashpower, the software behaves in a very predictable and known way. The chain grounds to a halt. Instead of it taking 10 minutes to mine a block, it takes, say, a few hours per block. You have 2016 blocks before you have a difficulty ramp-down. What that means for users is that it’s unusable for a while. What happens when there’s a hard fork is there’s going to be – the vast majority of hashpower will activate and secure the 2 MB chain. There will be a chain that nobody uses. Number three, there will be a tiny amount of activist users who don’t want a hard fork at all. And that will continue as a much smaller security level. Say it does split and the minority group coin doesn't work as well in the way that you described. Isn't that forcing choice? I agree. That's very true. There are unquestionably incentives that lend you to stick to the chain with the most hashpower. But the governance point is that there's a choice point. Whereas in a soft fork there's not. But every user has to make that choice. I think the more informed each user is, the better. What do you think of other scaling proposals like BIP 148 or BitcoinABC? UASF has no hashpower and no economic nodes supporting them. If it weren't for Segwit2x activating SegWit, they would fork themselves off into the unusable chain scenario that I described. They would have to create a second chain fork to correct the difficulty to get back to the 10-minute block times. That’s how it will play out without hashpower, which looks like unlikely scenario. With hashpower, which is how things are playing out now, SegWit will get activated and the UASF folks will get what they were asking for – and there will be no chain split. BitcoinABC is creating a new coin. Segwit2x is not going to have a major impact on BitcoinABC itself. There will be a slight reduction in hashpower, maybe 4% moves to BitcoinABC. It’s essentially an altcoin, where every bitcoin holder has a stake in the new coin. It shouldn’t majorly impact bitcoin users or Segwit2x. Some people are saying that the UASF is what led to Segwit2x, and that mining pools are are signaling for BIP 91 right now to avoid a UASF. It's basically to maintain unity. Not to avoid UASF, but to make sure that everyone on the main chain stays on the chain by activating SegWit. It's the unity path. Everyone, including the UASF activists, get what they want, which is SegWit activating. It's going through the Segwit2x path by activating at 'bit 4,' which should lock-in today. That will flip on 'bit 1' which will activate SegWit. That 'bit 4' activation three months in the future will also trigger the fork rule change. Some have argued that sidechains are a better alternative to a 2MB hard fork, since users can opt-in to a system with whatever blocksize parameter they want. Bloq sponsors the Drivechain project, which is a project for adding usable sidechains to bitcoin in the future. Blockstream originated the sidechain proposal, but their sidechain never really made it to bitcoin. Drivechain technology potentially allows you to have a sidechain that has huge blocks, it doesn’t matter what rules are on there. The issue with that is maturity level. It's an in-the-lab science project. Were it more secure, it might be a better solution today, but like Lightning it's a very promising technology that’s still getting baked. So the 2 MB parameter increase is a short-term solution. Then, maybe Drivechain come later? Exactly. Basically, the 2 MB hard fork is the one path that we know with 100% that guarantees increased capacity. We don’t know how much capacity SegWit will deliver because we don't know how many or how few people will update their wallet software to enable SegWit. That’s an unknown. Lightning, we don’t know anything about the trust model or economics of that. So, we don’t know if that will be used. Sidechains are similarly just getting baked. All of these are promising projects that we don’t know will be a solution yet. The 2 MB hard fork is definitely a stopgap until we get something better. But as I always say, mind the gap. It’s pragmatism versus a years-long science project that may or may not work out. How long do you plan to work on Segwit2x? Are you in it for the longhaul or do you plan to stop after the hard fork? No, it's a very focused. It will not expand its charter at all. This is in keeping with IETF working groups. We have this one charter to activate SegWit and activate a hard fork and that’s it. It’s a one-and-done. You see the same thing at Red Hat, where I used to work, for developing software and hardware specifications. When working on the Linux kernel, we got people who hated each other and they actually worked together in a focused setting, accomplishing a specific goal, such as developing USB specifications. Segwit2x is modeled after that. It will be disbanded after that’s in place. Now, the BTC1 project, I’m calling the Fedora of bitcoin. It will be around after the Segwit2x . Any plans on what you’ll do with BTC1 after that? I really want to create a community that’s more professional that doesn’t spin narratives and sling mud and that welcomes more developers. When I worked at Linux we helped new developers up the steep learning curve. We could do that, but instead, to my sadness, we have certain portions of the community who are very negative about any new developments and negative in pushing the bounds. Ethereum has been very welcoming. Bitcoin is by far the most secure blockchain out there, and much more secure than ethereum. But ethereum is doing a better job of attracting new developers. I want BTC1 to be sort of that welcome sign that I chose as an icon for the project. We want to welcome new projects, welcoming new ideas, rather than attacking ideas that are outside a self-defined bubble. Is the plan to replace Bitcoin Core? Absolutely not. This is a patchset on top of Bitcoin Core. We'll use the best of Bitcoin Core, and we very much welcome those contributions, but also other contributions as well. We want to work with Bitcoin Core, not against Core. Even if they disagree with us working with them, we want to work with them. That’s what’s so amusingly ironic. The original SegWit authors are doing everything that they can to delay the rollout of SegWit, which is what Segwit2x is actually accomplishing. You mentioned ethereum. A lot of people do mention that they’re more welcoming to new developers or new ideas. But some people argue that that could be a problem for the security of the software. That’s absolutely right. We’re securing money. With new ideas, comes new risks. Where Segwit2x comes in is it that, the core contingent is way too much on the conservative side where we're letting bitcoin slam into this fee wall, which was predictable years ago, rather than prepare for a hard fork. You can risk-adjust yourself into a corner and hurt market share where you’re being so conservative that nobody can use it. Now that BIP91 has locked in, what do you see ahead? Ultimately I think the best path for SegWit, which is not going to happen, would be to deploy it on a sidechain, test it on money for a year and integrate it into bitcoin. It's seen some real money testing in litecoin, but that’s it. Litecoin, they’ve only done the first step. Wallets aren’t using SegWit. The ideal scenario would have been a much longer cycle of real-money testing on a sidechain. That was the original vision of sidechains. But we have what we have today. I think that Segwit2x is the best chance to deploy SegWit and to keep everyone on one coin. It clearly has a large amount of buy-in, so we’re confident of its success.

                            Understanding Bitcoin's Scaling Debate: Politics Comes First                        ",Jim Harper,https://www.coindesk.com/understanding-bitcoins-scaling-debate-politics-comes-first/,"Jim Harper is vice president of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, where he works to adapt law and policy to the information age. A former counsel to committees in both the US House and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014. In this opinion piece, Harper lays out how politics controls many of the decisions being made in the bitcoin scaling debate, offering a solution for those involved.  Software programmers are usually collegial and collaborative, but parts of the bitcoin developer community are currently displaying the kind of acrimony familiar to political capitols like Washington, D.C. Understanding the nature of the scaling debate then might help the bitcoin community better iterate on the protocol and software in the future. But, what's behind the strife when amendments to bitcoin's rules – or stasis – become so controversial? What unrecognized dimensions of the debate allowed it to become so divisive and debased?   One is collective resistance to the fact that decisions about bitcoin's direction are political decisions, which technical decisions must follow. Priorities vary, but the bitcoin community's aims include global financial inclusion and economic development, human liberty and dignity, privacy and a truly stable money supply. By debating only in terms of technology, the leading advocates for different paths have failed to articulate any unifying human vision for bitcoin's future. That's a recipe for alienating intellectual war. The news isn't all bad: The scaling debate will be concluded using market forces. Bitcoin escapes politics as practiced in coercive government. It just doesn't escape politics all the way. The bitcoin protocol and software is technical, obviously, in that they involve the application of technology to interesting challenges. How to configure bitcoin is political, though, because it involves choices made by groups. Choosing in groups is no simple thing. The first step in group decision-making is to constitute a group. People are usually better off when they work together under a common set of rules. Bitcoin's protocol is a clear example. But what commits them to any group? Social contract theory is the leading explanation in modern Western philosophy for life under governments. Nobody ever actually signs that contract, so it’s a little dissatisfying. Bitcoin's version of the social contract is ""consensus."" That commonly used word contains the idea that using the bitcoin protocol reflects agreement with its terms. But this isn't necessarily the case. Treating use as agreement is probably insulting to dissenters from the status quo – just like ""social contract"" dissatisfies many U.S. citizens obligated to pay taxes for unending war. Confusingly, ""consensus"" is also used to denote synchronization of blockchain data among bitcoin nodes. However they feel about it, bitcoin users have joined a group, and they have choices to make together. Once a group is constituted, ""it may appear that the chiefs, leaders or shamans of the group exert coercive force on members."" Those are the words of public choice economists Michael and Kevin Munger in their book Choosing in Groups. Happily, there is no literal coercion in bitcoin-land, but it harkens to the observation of Konrad Graf that the maximum block size, a ""production ceiling"" on transactions, is economically equivalent to a government intervention. Dissenters from the status quo feel the familiar strains of tyranny, which they thought bitcoin would help everyone escape. That is nonsensical and shocking to the Core side, who see themselves as following standard open-source development processes. Their conservative approach, including maintenance of the 1MB limit on bitcoin blocks, safeguards a $40 billion asset, securing it against the predations of real governments. To them, the most satisfying explanations for opposition to their approach range from simple ignorance to profit-hungry short-termism on the part of bitcoin companies. The software development mode exemplified by Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) standard-setting processes is an attractive and successful model of cooperation. But bitcoin development may diverge from the theory about open source that the IETF helped spawn. Open-source development does not automatically digest and balance community values, enshrining them in code. In the dominant bitcoin implementation, a small number of people have commit access, and they have disproportionate power to determine what goes into the code base. These humans, intending only the best, are subject to the influence of their own premises, their social circle and a simple incapacity to capture and prioritize all the interests that would be served by a global public utility such as bitcoin. The user side of the equation also fails the theory, stated well by economist Vili Lehdonvirta: ""Bitcoin is purely 'math-based money,' and all the developers are doing is purely apolitical plumbing work."" Developers have relatively greater power many bitcoin users do not have the technical capacity to reconfigure their own code or to choose wisely from among competing implementations. Bitcoin developers have had far fewer meetings than the IETF did at a similar stage. The reservoir of goodwill was already low before the scaling debate drained it. And bitcoin development may also be materially different from other standards-setting efforts. We may be seeing for the first time what happens when open-source software development hits the commercial layer. Technical communications standards are essentially neutral as to the content or meaning they will convey. Bitcoin standards define and shape markets. One illustration of the power of the protocol is the rise in transaction fees, which for the time being has cut off use cases such as payments and savings for people in poorer parts of the world. That is no technical engineering decision. It delays crucial economic development that otherwise would sustain and bring joy to potentially millions or even billions of people. That vision – of bitcoin at its best, having its most tremendous consequences – has been notably absent from the scaling debate. If at all, the sides represent their animating goals ambiguously as ""payments"" on the one hand or ""digital gold"" on the other. Among many of its social capital deficits, bitcoin lacks visionary leadership. The outcomes sought by the bitcoin community are widely agreed upon, but they are typically left unspoken. A development team that articulates a view of bitcoin's horizons in human terms could unify the community. Then, given more study of the economics of bitcoin's systems, technical decisions could follow. Such decisions could be made with wide understanding that the trade-offs involved are faithful to the bitcoin community’s widely agreed-upon goals. At present that is left unclear. Network effects, of course, are the shackles that keep many dissenters chained to bitcoin, and (they feel) under the yoke of Core. The current threat of chain splits may produce a real-world test of how many bitcoin versions can exist. Experience with ethereum and ethereum classic suggest that multiple chains can co-exist. And, for three reasons, network effects don't dictate disaster from chain splits: The bitcoin community has a lot to learn about itself and what it is doing in the scaling debate. The debate's tenor – those angry words and base insinuations – are commonplace in political capitols like Washington, D.C. But at the end of the day in those places, vicious political opponents can also get together to cooperate on matters of agreement. Whatever the outcome, bitcoin users should expect that kind of professionalism and maturity from all participants in the scaling debate. Political gridlock image via Shutterstock

With the move, the market capitalization of the asset class is again advancing toward $100bn, a figure it first exceeded in June when it reached an all-time high of $115bn. At press time, the market is valued at just over $94 billion. Still, it remains to be seen how much of that capital will remain given the rapid escalation observed in the price. On Thursday, the price of bitcoin increased from just under $2,500 to a high of $2,889 amid an increasingly positive outlook for its technology development, analysts said. Data from Coinmarketcap indicates the market capitalization of the digital asset increased accordingly, rising to $46 billion, from an opening figure of $37.9 billion. Despite the rising bitcoin price, however, other assets have been performing strongly. At publication, nine of the top 10 cryptocurrencies were showing gains, with only one, ether, showcasing a slight 24-hour decline. The figures further suggest an influx of largely new capital into bitcoin, rather than investors repositioning prior investments. Roulette image via Shutterstock

                            BIP 91 Locks In: What This Means for Bitcoin and Why It's Not Scaled Yet                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bip-91-locks-means-bitcoin-not-scaled-yet/,"BIP 91 has officially locked in. At press time, bitcoin's miners, the network of computer operators that secure the blockchain, have now been signaling that they will upgrade the code for 269 blocks in the same signaling period, a move that takes the software one step closer to changing its structure to accommodate more transactions. Stepping back, the move finds miners agreeing to cement the first part of a larger effort to upgrade bitcoin, called Segwit2x. The controversial proposal seeks to change the transaction structure of the network via Segregated Witness, and increase a cap on the amount of data that can be stored in transaction blocks, a move tentatively scheduled for later this fall. With the signaling, mining pools nearly unanimously rallied behind the proposal, and BIP 91, designed partly to avoid a potential bitcoin split in the network, emerged as the first major step in following the roadmap. In response, bitcoin saw a sharp price increase on Thursday due to the perceived forward progress, with some calling the BIP 91 lock-in a victory marking a ""new dawn"" for bitcoin. But, the lock-in is just the first step to activating SegWit on the network, and other steps come with a bit more complexity. Specifically, the following things need to happen for it to activate: The latter is when Segwit activation is ""all in the clear,"" as BIP 91 creator James Hilliard put it. That's when bitcoin's SegWit upgrade will be official, and an upcoming user-activated soft fork (UASF) proposal, BIP 148, superseded. But some community members, including respected bitcoin developers and mining pool operators are raising concerns about possible missteps between the time BIP 91 is activated and SegWit locks in. These concerns boil down to: In simpler terms, some bitcoin users don’t trust others to keep their word. Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop seems like one of those, suggesting via Twitter that one potential outcome is SegWit not activating at all this time around, even though a few scaling proposals are coming to a head soon. But Hilliard waves that apprehension off. ""There'd have to be a lot of mess ups,"" he told CoinDesk. For him, it just doesn't seem likely since lock-in has recently been at the top of mining pool operator's priority list. Behind the scenes, he and other pool operators have been restlessly working to ensure BIP 91 goes according to plan and bitcoin transitions to the new ruleset smoothly. Plus, even more Core contributors, who have been largely opposed to Segwit2x, are helping smooth the transition. Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo has been making updates to FIBRE, the fast block-relaying network miners use, which Hilliard said is ""probably what’s holding a lot of this together."" It seems many people want to see BIP 91 succeed, likely in an effort to supersede more aggressive alternatives such as BIP 148. While Hilliard agrees with the concept of a UASF, he believes BIP 148 could be riskier than BIP 91. And finally, because transitioning to the new BIP 91 rules relies on mining pools alone, Hilliard said: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the Segwit2x agreement.

                            Bitcoin Price Surges to One-Month High as Tech Outlook Improves                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-surges-one-month-price-high-tech-outlook-improves/,"After dropping to a low of $1,836 this weekend, the bitcoin price is once again climbing back toward all-time highs. According to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index, the price of bitcoin rebounded to $2,730 today, the highest value observed on the BPI since June 23 and just $300 off its all-time high of $3,025, set on June 11. So, what's driving traders? Overall, analysts are reporting that the recovery is largely due to the improving outlook for bitcoin's technology roadmap, spurred by the expected 'lock in' of a code upgrade called BIP 91 today. The piece of code that will set the stage for the first part of the Segwit2x scaling proposal, BIP 91 could upgrade the bitcoin blockchain to support Segregated Witness (SegWit), thereby increasing the network's transaction capacity. At time of publication, miners need to continue to signal for BIP 91 for roughly 20 additional blocks in order to lock in the upgrade. At this point, BIP 91 will enter a ""grace period"" of 336 blocks, before activation. Complexities escalate from there, as it remains possible SegWit might not be activated under certain scenarios owing to how miners might run the code. Still, the positive sentiment offered a break from the doom and gloom of the debate that has shrouded the market for weeks. With bitcoin rising, prices were up similarly across the cryptocurrency markets, with all of the top 30 by market capitalization posting gains today. But as traders have a long history of positioning investments in relation to bitcoin scaling proposals, the run-up in price was perhaps not surprising to many. Iqbal Gandham, managing director at social trading firm eToro, noted that much of the activity is likely due to positive sentiment. He also noted how it might be somewhat divorced from any strong conviction of what might or might not occur. ""Segwit, block size increases and the various mechanisms by which to deliver this have been difficult to understand for traders, and they are at the point where they just want clarity and a clear direction,"" he said. ""We may now have one."" In this way, Kevin Zhou, a trader and market analyst with crypto trading fund Galois Capital, credited the advancement of BIP 91 with the run-up in price. In particular, he said, traders are responding to the decreasing likelihood that bitcoin could split into two competing assets (though this is still possible later this year), and the increase in capacity SegWit would bring. ""It's not just reduced uncertainty over whether there will be a chain split, but also less uncertainty over how exchanges will handle a chain split and the issues that come with it (e.g. replay attacks, reorg risk, margin positions, etc.),"" he said. Still, while less possible, tensions in the scaling debate could simply go into hibernation, only to reemerge later this year. With major miners threatening to fork off onto a separate blockchain should the block size not be raised, it remains possible this debate will lie dormant until fall, at which point, tensions could reemerge. Under the Segwit2x proposal, a large group of startups and miners agreed to a 2 MB hard fork that would occur three months after Segwit is enacted. Developers have largely sought to downplay the idea as risky and dangerous.        How aware the market is of this reality remains to be seen, though some sought to stress the short-term positivity and its impact. ""We still have to worry about whether the market will accept the '2x' half of Segwit2x, but at least there likely won't be an initial split for the SegWit half,"" Zhou remarked. Likewise, Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin leveraged trading firm BitMEX, went so far as to predict bitcoin could once again test all-time highs should the network enact SegWit in the coming days. ""The reason why we didn't surpass $3,000 earlier this summer was the specter of UASF [and a bitcoin split]. With that roadblock removed and Segwit activated, money will pour into the system,"" he said. Hayes concluded: Bitcoin image via Shutterstock

                            'Bitcoin Sign Guy' Has a New Job, But He's Keeping His Identity Secret                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-sign-guy-new-job-hes-keeping-identity-secret/,"It's been a tumultuous week since the man known as ""Bitcoin Sign Guy"" held up a pad of paper emblazoned with the words ""Buy Bitcoin"" during a congressional address by US Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen. But while details about Bitcoin Sign Guy remain largely shrouded in mystery, a few things appear to be certain. Namely, since drawing international attention to the cryptocurrency, he has apparently received thousands of dollars in bitcoin, become known (perhaps in jest) as one of the most often cited people in bitcoin and, most recently, got himself a new job. In a blog post yesterday, the non-profit public policy organization, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, revealed Bitcoin Sign Guy was the newest member of its team. Bitcoin Sign Guy's new boss, former Bitcoin Foundation board member Jim Harper told CoinDesk his latest intern, ""BSG,"" had completed his first day of work, deeming it a success. But what stands out in Harper's description is the persistent protection his latest hire's identity. According to Harper, the decision to refer to Bitcoin Sign Guy by his given pseudonym is in line with the ""bitcoin tradition"" that began with the cryptocurrency's creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Harper wrote in an email: Harper's post described BSG as a recent college graduate working with ""financial technology, bitcoin and the burgeoning variety of cryptocurrencies emerging on the scene to compete with government monopoly money."" In his email, Harper further described his newest team member's first day at the office as including work with a researcher to explore a ""blue ocean"" study aimed at giving blockchain ""a fully free financial future."" ""When I got to talking to him,"" wrote Harper, ""I found him a poised young man with sophisticated knowledge of bitcoin, crypto and financial services generally."" Since BSG pulled off the publicity stunt, he's become a bit of a conversational staple, as evidenced by his citation in numerous informal polls. What remains to be seen, though, is why he needed the job in the first place. A tweet – posted by his ""friend"" as a way to share a bitcoin address and prove that he was the person who held the sign – was later removed, siting concerns about employment. As for Harper, he appears to have no such concerns. ""He's a young person with a long life ahead of him,"" he wrote. Bitcoin Sign Guy image via Twitter

                            Bitcoin Startups Advise Caution as Scaling Proposals Collide                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchanges-advise-caution-scaling-proposals-collide/,"With a major inflection point for bitcoin just days away, some users are beginning to wonder about the safety of their holdings on major exchanges. At issue is that several scaling proposals are set to come to a head on or around August 1, and depending on which end up gaining support, there is a risk that bitcoin could split into two competing currencies running on two different blockchains. In the face of this concern, and the painful lessons learned from past blockchain forks, some exchanges are stepping up to make users aware of possible issues and how they can protect their assets. Below, we're keeping a running list of major exchanges and their remarks. One of the world's largest cryptocurrency exchanges, Bitfinex has yet to issue a blog post on the topic. However, we have some clues to their potential views, because Bitfinex was part of an exchange coalition which sought to address a split in March. At the time, Bitfinex said it would refrain from halting its operations, and provided context on how it would name each coin. The firm has not responded to requests for comment as to whether its policy has since changed on the issue. At press time, bitFlyer has yet to issue an update on its strategy. The Japanese exchange was one of the signers of the Segwit2x proposal on May 23. One of South Korea's largest exchanges, and the victim of a recent hack, Bithumb has yet to issue guidance. China's oldest bitcoin exchange, BTCC is putting its full support behind Segwit2x. Actively testing the code, the exchange said it's upgrading its exchanges and pool wallets to the new software. It expects to have upgrades complete by July 21, and it will continue signaling support. ""We hope that the community will reach consensus around this implementation of the bitcoin software,"" the post continued. Should the network split, BTCC said it will consider the longest chain, which would be the one with the most hashing power, as bitcoin (BTC). BTCC customers that want to move to the minority chain will be given access to their tokens. The exchange also said it's working to put in place strong ""replay protection"" (aimed to stop bitcoin transacted on one blockchain being broadcast on the other) to protect user funds in the case of a hard fork. One of the largest and best-funded US exchanges, Coinbase signed the SegWit2x agreement back in May. While the startup has yet to issue remarks on how its consumer wallets would handle a split, its exchange product, GDAX, was among the first to offer details in a July 13 Medium post. The exchange sees two possible outcomes, writing: Because of this, the exchange said it may suspend deposits and withdrawals for bitcoin temporarily, and it might also pause trading. According to the post: ""This decision will be based on our assessment of the technical risks posed by the fork, such as replay attacks and other factors that could create network instability."" The South Korean exchange has issued a blog post on its website mentioning the current scaling war, but it has not disseminated any statement on its policies for a potential split. On July 19, Gemini updated an older blog post on a possible split with new information regarding the scenario. ""In the event of a hard fork, we will carefully consider our response and how to move forward. We understand that our customers have diverse opinions on this subject, and we will do our best to incorporate your suggestions,"" the blog post said. It continues to say that, if a hard fork is anticipated, Gemini will suspend deposits and withdrawals. While the exchange said it was still weighing its options, the current plan is as follows: One of China's largest bitcoin exchanges, Huobi said it is preparing for the potential of a bitcoin fork with several policies: Another South Korean exchange that supports Segwit2x, Korbit hasn't updated its website or blog. The exchange responded to requests for comment, but has yet to offer details on its policy regarding a potential split. OKCoin’s policies, outlined in a July 18 blog post, are similar to Huobi's in that they will suspend bitcoin deposits and withdrawals close to the event. For OKCoin that's from July 31 through August 2. They advise customers to deposit coins in advance in an effort to not affect their trading. If there is no fork, operations will continue as usual, but, if there is, every blockchain user will be given their rightful ownership of coins, and they will support every type of bitcoin on their trading platform. Yet, OKCoin lists two further actions it will take: The crypto-only trading and lending platform has yet to publish details on its policies leading up to the possible August 1 divergence. The exchange did, however, comment on concerns in a March blog post on what its policies might be should a split occur, stating any hard fork must have replay protection. ""Without this, exchanges cannot continuously and properly operate,"" the post said. Poloniex went on to say it would ""support Bitcoin Core continuously as BTC,"" nodding to the cryptocurrency's open-source developer group, which has roundly rejected the Segwit2x proposal. Poloniex has not responded to requests for further comment. Hardware wallet provider Trezor said it has received an increasing number of questions regarding potential outcomes of the scaling proposals and the possibility of a split. In a July 18 blog post, the company acknowledged it is unclear how the network will develop, but assured users that its wallet is the ""safest place"" even for an event such as a bitcoin split. The bitcoin wallet and vault issued a blog post on July 20 explaining what its customers can expect in the event of a bitcoin fork. Until they can confirm transactions can be done safely, Xapo may temporarily halt outgoing and incoming transfers from the bitcoin network, and may also suspend conversion from dollars and other currencies to bitcoin and vice versa through the Xapo Debit Card. In the event of a split, the company will support the one with the ""most accumulated difficulty."" Although, the company will give users the choice to withdraw their coins in the secondary blockchain, or let Xapo sell the coins in the secondary blockchain and add the value they receive to the user's account on the supported blockchain.

                            Research Finds Design Flaws in Scaling Proposal Bitcoin Unlimited                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/research-flaws-scaling-proposal-bitcoin-unlimited-emergent-consensus/,"A new research paper from international analyst group IMEC has found that changes to bitcoin proposed by a software implementation called Bitcoin Unlimited would ""magnify the effectiveness"" of attacks on the network. An alternative version of the software, Bitcoin Unlimited emerged in 2016 as an effort by like-minded developers and startups that sought to replace bitcoin's hard-coded block size, the center of the sprawling scaling debate, with a new concept called ""emergent consensus."" As outlined in our CoinDesk Explainer, the idea was that, rather than having rules like block size specified directly in the code, nodes and miners could be made to converge on bitcoin's rules naturally, using free market principles. However, using game theoretic modeling, the IMEC study finds miners with the economic resources to support larger data blocks have ""both the incentive and the ability"" to force out smaller miners from the network. The researchers used two models as a proxy for the ""social choice"" involved in this decision-making, testing how the idea would function in both secure and challenging conditions. Specifically, the report found that by having miners and nodes signal both an ""excessive block size"" and ""maximum acceptable block size"" as a means to determine the rules, new attack vectors would open, essentially letting miners ""deliberately fork the network"" if desired. ""Our results ... prove that forks happen frequently when the attacker's block size is flexible,"" the report authors state. The study ultimately finds that the nature of the bitcoin mining business, in which various entities compete for rewards using pools of computing power, means miners capable of supporting large blocks can collude to force peers out of competition. ""During the transition period, people might broadcast different [excessive block sizes] to advocate their preferred block size and threaten other miners, leaving the system in a vulnerable state. Moreover, if block size keeps rising in the system, eventually some public nodes will not be able to handle these large blocks and the decentralized nature of bitcoin is damaged,"" the paper continues, adding: Even in separate tests where it was assumed miners were compliant with protocol rules, analysis found that ""strategic"" miners could gain block rewards ""unproportional to their mining power"" and trigger ""long forks ... more easily and more frequently"" than under the constraints of the software's current design. Ultimately, the paper finds that the security implications of such a change have ""not been thoroughly analyzed."" Penned by researchers Ren Zhang and Bart Preneel, the paper provides a refreshingly scientific context to a technical side of a debate often defined by vitriol. Though, it's one that likely impacts the politics of the issue as well. A potential issue critics may find with the paper is that it appears to assume a more decentralized network, in which smaller node operates would still be considered as providing a valuable service to the protocol. This is notable as proponents of larger blocks have long sought to downplay the impact of high node operation costs. Indeed, a fundamental divide between the two camps ideologically appears to be their views on miner and node consolidation, with developers seeing this as antithetical to bitcoin's value proposition, while startups have seemed more accepting of the trend as a side-effect of economics and business. Still, it remains to be seen just what the impact will be, given that the network is close to activating an alternative proposal. Called Segwit2x, the proposal would enact Segregated Witness, a code change proposed by bitcoin's current open-source development team. At press time, just 10.75 percent of nodes were signaling for the Bitcoin Unlimited implementation, according to an online data source.

The conversation on how to best upgrade the bitcoin network to accommodate a greater transaction capacity has been a long one, dating back to the earliest forums and message boards. However, it wasn't until 2014 that the idea that bitcoin's technology may need to adapt to increasing usage entered the industry spotlight. Since then, there's been a heated, seemingly non-stop debate that, at best, has showcased the depth and creativity of the developers working on the open-source project, and at worst, has shown the damage a 24-hour online commentary can have on scientific pursuits.

Bitcoin's Next Segwit2x Lock-in Period Starts Today                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/will-miners-signal-bitcoins-next-segwit2x-lock-period-starts-today/,"Should certain timelines be met, bitcoin could soon be upgraded to support Segregated Witness (SegWit). A long-proposed upgrade that would increase the transaction capacity of the bitcoin network, SegWit would be triggered if miners decide to support the BIP 91 code proposal, itself a part of the larger Segwit2x scaling initiative. Currently, BIP 91 is close to the necessary threshold (80% of mining power), with mining pools representing about 76% of bitcoin's computing power seemingly making good on a promise to support the proposal. That percentage of mining pools, though, must signal in a type of unison, during a signaling period. Due to how the BIP 91 code is written, the 80% threshold must be reached within a 336-block period. But it's not just any consecutive 336-block period. Instead, there are set windows where miners can signal support, meaning 269 of the consecutive 336 blocks within the period must signal with ""bit 4"" in the block header. The next signaling period starts tonight at block 476,448, and will end at block 476,784, about two-and-a-half days from now. If 80% of mining pools don't activate SegWit in the period that starts tonight, they'll have other opportunities before August 1 when another scaling proposal BIP 148 will activate. Although, this could lead bitcoin down a few different paths, as CoinDesk's visual guide to the scaling debate demonstrates.

                            A Chinese Bitcoin Tycoon and His Record-Breaking ICO                        ",Wolfie Zhao,https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-bitcoin-tycoon-record-breaking-ico/,"One of China's biggest bitcoin investors has raised approximately $82m in an initial coin offering (ICO), setting a new record for the novel fundraising method in China. Led by entrepreneur Li Xiaolai, Press.One bills itself as a decentralized content distribution platform based on the recently launched EOS blockchain. In total, the ICO collected 5,853 bitcoin, 106,757 ether and 30,430,519 EOS from 14,104 participants. But while the figures may be impressive, the final numbers represented less than half the project's initial target of $200m – in part due to a decline in prices across the global cryptocurrency markets. Since the the ICO began, the prices of bitcoin, ether and EOS have fallen 18 percent, 26 percent, and 46 percent, respectively, shrinking the total market value of the project by an estimated $52m. However, it may not be the decline in prices that was the only factor in the missed target. Skeptics of the ICO have publicly argued that the project is too ambiguous and ambitious, with some also claiming that the project lacks a white paper to explain its technical details and offers limited information on the development team. Users of social platforms including 8BTC, Weibo, WeChat and Steemit further expressed concerns over the way the ICO was managed and its legality. Based on the Press.One website, the purpose of the ICO is to build a public blockchain based on EOS. Other than traditional media, potential competitors to Press.One include content distribution site Steemit, which helps content creators receive rewards for their work and is based on similar technology to EOS. Besides Li, who serves as CEO, the project lists Li Lu as chief technology officer. The two previously partnered to launch a website named Knewone, which became Less, a lifestyle community sharing application. Another unusual characteristic of the Press.one project is the distribution of 10 billion tokens, dubbed PRS, which will only be dispersed to contributors six months after the ICO. Temporarily, though, the tokens are scheduled to be tradable on July 12, 2018. The other side of the story is Li's growing popularity as a successful and what some portray as inspiring investor. Born in the 1970s, Li started a career as a salesman and became a well-known English teacher in China. Prior to the emergence of bitcoin, Li had already made a name for himself by publishing two bestselling books about time management and methods in mastering vocabularies for English tests. Then, in 2011, he started mining and investing in bitcoin, and by 2014, he reportedly owned over 100,000 bitcoins, making him one of the largest investors in the cryptocurrency. After founding the Bitfund venture capital firm in 2013, Li also established Yunbi, a cryptocurrency exchange based in China. According to Coinmarketcap, that exchange is now the 7th largest in the world by trading volume.

                            CoinDesk Explainer: How BIP 91 Enacts SegWit While Avoiding a Bitcoin Split                        ",Amy Castor,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-explainer-bitcoin-bip-91-implements-segwit-avoiding-split/,"While many thought signaling for the controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x wouldn't begin until July 21, bitcoin miners are now doing just that by way of a piece of code called BIP 91. At press time, nearly 60% of the last 144 blocks mined have signaled support for the measure. But, what are miners signaling for, and what does bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 91 mean for the network? As the first part of the Segwit2x scaling plan, BIP 91 does two things: Segwit2x was introduced during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference in May. Based on a fork of the Bitcoin Core software client called BTC1, Segwit2x seeks to both implement SegWit and raise the block size limit. About a month later, in response to that, Bitmain Warranty engineer James Hilliard introduced BIP 91 as a way to implement SegWit quickly and safely, without the risk of splitting the network. He specifically developed the proposal with two other active proposals for scaling bitcoin in mind. These include: But, more importantly, BIP 91 was proposed as an alternative to having to completely redeploy BIP 141, a task that would have been technically infeasible, given that BIP 141 does not expire until mid-November. To explain further, a bitcoin soft fork deployment requires that miners set a bit in the version field of blocks they mine to signal their readiness to enforce new rules. Segwit2x originally called for BIP 141 to require a ""bit 4"" signalling, but BIP 141 was already coded to respond to ""bit 1"" signalling. So, to get around that, BIP 91 employs a clever trick. Rather than change the existing SegWit activation logic, it uses a secondary bit to signal mandatory enforcement of the original bit. As such, BIP 91 uses the same BIP 9 soft fork deployment method as BIP 141, but with a few key differences: So, once that 80% threshold is reached, BIP 91 locks in, and another 336 blocks later, it activates. At that point, BIP 141 is enforced using the same technique as BIP 148: As long as 51% of miners (by hash power) enforce the mandatory ""bit 1"" signalling, the chain will not split. And since a majority will have already supported BIP 91 activation via the ""bit 4"" signalling, maintaining that hash power is unlikely to be a problem. Two weeks (2,016 blocks) after enforcement begins, BIP141 locks in, and another two weeks after that, SegWit activates. BIP 91 was also a recognition of the realities of the scaling debate. Namely, the fact that, nearly a year down the road, BIP 141 still has not gained traction with miners. While BIP 141 requires a 95% miner support (by hash power), the figure has remained stuck at around 30%, though recently it increased to 45%. But if BIP 91 is almost identical to BIP 141, why didn't miners signal support for the latter? The reason is two-fold: But, the proposal that has had the biggest impact on BIP 91's design is BIP 148, the so-called UASF discussed above. In many ways, BIP 91 can be read as an effort to front-run the BIP 148 proposal, thus removing the potential of creating two rival bitcoin blockchains, each with competing assets. To resolve that issue, Hilliard proposed that BIP 91 should activate before BIP 148's August 1 deadline. And of course, he made that possible by essentially shortening BIP 141's original two-week activation period to 56 hours. Miners today are signaling their support for BIP 91 early because of the perceived need to avoid the split BIP 148 could create or, as others speculate, because some miners think that a successful UASF would reduce their control over network changes. For now, your best bet is to watch the upcoming 336-block period. Beginning tonight at block 476,448, this is the next period during which miners can signal for BIP 91. Should 269 blocks signal for BIP 91 within a 56-hour window, BIP 91 will lock-in, setting the stage for the next phase of Segwit2x this autumn, or possibly later.
 And, with bitcoin's three largest mining pools throwing their computing power behind the effort, it is possible that the threshold will be reached before the end of the week. Edit: BIP 91 lock in requires 269 (80%) of blocks to signal over 336 block period. An early version of this story incorrectly stated 226 blocks were needed.

To be held over two days on the 4th and 5th of the month, the conference follows previous events that have aimed to unite bitcoin's international developer community to address how its technology could be improved to accommodate more users. Notable scaling technologies including Segregated Witness and Bitcoin-NG, were both presented at the conference, and past venues have included Politecnico di Milano, in Italy, Centre Mont Royal Salon in Montreal, and Hong Kong's Cyberport district. Still, despite the fact that the ongoing scaling debate is again flaring, conference organizers gave little indication that the format for the conference would change. Ferdinando Ametrano, chair of the host committee for the 2016 conference in Milan, said in a statement: Topics to be addressed include improving bitcoin's throughput, network resilience, block size proposals and more. The addition of the latter topic is notable, as the Scaling Bitcoin conference has received criticism in the past over its perceived failure to discuss block size, with a minor protest event even taking up the subject to coincide with the 2016 Milan event.

Announced today, SatoshiPay has partnered with the IOTA Foundation, a non-profit that oversees network development, to explore replacing bitcoin with IOTA as its settlement network. SatoshiPay has been relying on the bitcoin network to settle payments since its product launch in 2015. Still, in that time, the economics of the bitcoin network have undoubtedly changed.  According to CoinDesk's forthcoming State of Blockchain report, the average transaction fee was around $2.41 per transaction during Q2, up from below $0.02 in 2015. SatoshiPay CEO Meinhard Benn wrote:  The IOTA network, the 8th largest cryptocurrency by the total value of its supply, by contrast, claims zero-fee transactions and does not limit the number of transactions per second of its processing, features the IOTA Foundation said make it unique among available cryptocurrencies. According to a blog post, the IOTA Foundation and SatoshiPay agreed to work on a proof-of-concept project, to be supported by the IOTA Ecosystem Fund, which would combine SatoshiPay’s content payment interface with IOTA's technology. The results of the joint proof-of-concept are expected to be presented in August 2017, according to the IOTA foundation. Notably, SatoshiPay is not the only startup to switch from bitcoin to another blockchain because of issues with the escalating costs of micropayments. In May, blockchain content startup Yours announced that it would switch to the litecoin citing similar concerns. Jar of pennies via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's Miners Signal for Segwit2x Scaling Proposal Early                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bip91-begins-bitcoins-miners-signal-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-early/,"Bitcoin's miners weren't expected to start signaling for the controversial scaling proposal Segwit2x until July 21, but some are already moving to show support in advance of another round of software testing. As of today, about 43% of bitcoin's mining power is signaling for the change, including AntPool, BitClub, Bixin, BTC.com and BitFury – and other mining pools may be on the way. Slush Pool, which oversees about 5% of the hashrate, said that it will soon signal as well. As of now, there is no way to tell which are running the code. Still, all miners need to do to lock-in the update is signal support for the change via a code proposal called BIP91. If a total of 80% of miners do so within the next 336 blocks, a period of about two days, the long-proposed code change Segregated Witness will lock-in. While surprising, the move is likely due to a perceived need to upgrade the protocol to support SegWit before August 1. That's when BIP148's user-activated soft fork kicks in, a change that could lead bitcoin to split into two competing assets if not enough of the ecosystem supports SegWit. Mining pools are setting a piece of code in each block that they mine to signal for Segwit2x, though it remains unclear what the state of the code is after a test release was delayed Friday. (Users can check to see how many mining pools are signaling for BIP91 here.) For more news, guides and updates on the issue, visit our dedicated blog page.

                            Bitcoin Meets DLT: Bitfury Releases 'Anchorable' Enterprise Blockchain                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitfury-releases-enterprise-blockchain-exonum/,"Can Bitfury Group replicate its success in enterprise blockchain? Long a leader in the lucrative bitcoin transaction processing sector, this has been an open question since the startup expanded its mission in a bid to win the trust – and business – of the world's biggest financial firms, governments and institutions. But it's also a question that now has new context, as Bitfury is today making public an enterprise blockchain initiative that has long been in development in the lab. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Bitfury Group is open-sourcing its first private blockchain framework, though it's one that offers a twist on the established idea. Called Exonum, the software aims to distinguish itself from DLT solutions by enabling users to secure data using the bitcoin blockchain. As explained by Valery Vavilov, the CEO of Bitfury Group, despite uncertainty surrounding the protocol's technical roadmap, potential clients are actually becoming more aware of bitcoin's strength as the longest-running and most secure blockchain in the world. Vavilov told CoinDesk: Alexander Shevchenko, head of Exonum, further stressed how the notion of adding cryptographic data from private, permissioned blockchains into the public bitcoin blockchain would strengthen the assurances of even trusted parties and networks. ""Anchoring brings security to the solution. Even if all the validators collude and want to go back in time and rewrite an Exonum blockchain, they can't do this,"" he said. As evidence of interest, the software is also already in use in Bitfury Group's ongoing projects – including its land title trial in Georgia, as well as an undisclosed insurance effort. For those who want to take a closer look, the source code for Exonum, written in Rust, is now available on GitHub. It will further be on display during an 11-city tour that begins today in the Netherlands, and that includes stops in Beijing, Boston and San Francisco. Still, anchoring the data isn't the only feature of Exonum. Also touted is the auditability the software provides by enabling developers to create both ""full clients"", which validate the full history of the system's data, and ""light clients"" that use this record to verify data. While that might sound like a slight feature, Shevchenko cited the infamous ""Heartbleed"" vulnerability, where a code issue in OpenSSL left as many as half a million websites exposed to exploits, as evidence of how Exonum's design could be a practical step in improving internet systems. As profiled in The New York Times, one of the major issues cited in the aftermath was the length of time it would take for OpenSSL's code to be audited, as well as its lack of regular reviews. By enabling light clients, Shevchenko contends more nodes can participate in Exonum networks, verifying and auditing data to avoid such issues. ""Each client guarantees correct data storage, and thus overall, it's self-auditable. Everything controls its tiny part, and you get this full audit of the system,"" he said. Vavilov continued: Still, that's not to say public blockchains are without difficulties. To this point, Bitfury Group went so far as to address concerns about the rising costs of bitcoin network use, and how they might impact Exonum networks that seek to tether transaction data to bitcoin. While Bitfury didn't provide specific figures, representatives indicated that it believes this would represent a ""low cost"", owing to how copies of data are stored on the bitcoin network. Should a consortium of users want to hash data, for example, they would simply set up a multi-signature wallet and then batch transaction timestamps onto the bitcoin blockchain, using the OP_RETURN feature in bitcoin's code. As even very small fractions of bitcoin can store additional information, the company argues the costs could be affordable even if the Exonum system was running processing as many as 3,000 transactions per second. ""The only thing we need to have is the bitcoin you need for the transaction fees,"" Shevchenko said. But what about users that don't want bitcoin's added security? Another major feature of Exonum is a new, unnamed consensus algorithm it claims improves on the Byzantine fault-tolerant protocols most often used today in distributed ledger proofs-of-concept. While the company did not disclose many details about the system, it described it as more robust and capable of achieving greater uptime. Elsewhere, Bitfury Group said Exonum's implementations can support features including multi-signature contracts, time locks and oracles. However, in interview, Vavilov mostly kept his sights on the biggest picture for how these features will enable what he believes will be an important leap in the use of blockchain technology. Evoking the classic comparison of private blockchains to intranets, Vavilov framed Exonum as a natural next step in bridging the gap between these systems, and public, open blockchains. Vavilov said: Going forward, Bitfury Group said it will seek to update the product ahead of the release of an enterprise version of Exonum in the coming months. Lightbulb image via Bitfury

The value of the total supply of all cryptocurrencies and crypto assets tracked similarly, dropping to $72bn, a figure that was 37 percent lower than its all-time high of $115bn set in June. Overall, the figures observed for both bitcoin and the total cryptocurrency market were the lowest since late May. Further, the asset class was down 11% over a 24-hour span at publication, a time during which it shed roughly $9bn in value.  When polled, responding analysts largely credited the decline to short-term concern about the markets, which have undergone a period of rapid appreciation since the beginning of 2017. Others pointed to the ongoing debate over bitcoin's technical roadmap, as well as uncertain over how planned upgrades could unfold, as a possible reason. ""It could be people who are not comfortable in holding bitcoin because of August 1st due date,"" Andrea Medri, founder of cryptocurrency exchange The Rock Trading, told CoinDesk. Also cited is the fact that ether's market has been similarly hit with sell pressure, spurred by the economics supporting recent ICO projects.

As reported earlier today by CoinDesk, BIP 148, which triggers a so-called user-activated soft fork, or UASF, to activate the Segregated Witness (SegWit) scaling solution, are pushing ahead with their plans despite the popularity of another scaling proposal, Segwit2x, which pairs the activation of SegWit with an increase to the size of the network's transaction blocks three months later. Yet if SegWit2x doesn't get enough support by August 1st and BIP 148 takes hold without enough of the bitcoin ecosystem support of its particular transaction chain, bitcoin could split into two competing assets. It's a prospect that led GDAX, which is operated by startup Coinbase, to announce last night that, in the event the UASF happens, it will temporarily halt deposits and withdrawals and could take further action. GDAX general manager Adam White wrote that the exchange could take action in the event that either one chain emerges as the stronger one or the two co-exist as separate chains, explaining: Coinbase was a signatory of an agreement struck in May between startups and miners in the industry, which led to the development of the Segwit2x proposal.

                            The Segwit2x Boycott: Bitcoin's UASF Isn't Backing Down From August Deadline                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/segwit2x-boycott-bitcoins-uasf-isnt-backing-august-deadline/,"Much of the bitcoin community is resistant to the idea of centralized control. So it shouldn't come as a surprise that some have developed a similar opposition to bitcoin scaling proposals that appear to have centralized leadership. And, some would argue there's no bigger offender in this vein than Segwit2x. A majority of major mining pools have pledged to trigger Segwit2x with their combined computing power by the end of this month, activating a long-awaited (though contentious) code change known as Segregated Witness (SegWit) that's been at the center of bitcoin's scaling debate. Later on, it would set the network down a road to a possible hard fork. But, a sizable group of bitcoin users isn't looking to follow the lead of mining pools. Mistrustful of this mining group, especially its particularly large players, some users are moving forward with a controversial proposal called BIP 148 on August 1. If mining pools do indeed lock in SegWit by the end of the month, UASF supporters might not need to move forward with BIP 148. But they aren't sure if mining pools will follow through. ""Unfortunately a few miners ... have a record of manipulation, so their signaling for SegWit2x can't be trusted,"" blockchain startup founder and BIP 148 supporter Ragnar Lifthrasir told CoinDesk. BIP 148 seeks to enact a user-activated soft fork (UASF) which would find node operators upgrading to SegWit. Yet, the move is interesting because of Segwit2x's popularity and the recent commitment from mining pools to activate SegWit before August. When asked about this, the UASF's GitHub maintainer, Miłosz Kwiatkowski, responded similar to Lifthrasir, telling CoinDesk: Kwiatkowski added users want to ""feel protected"" in the case mining pools do not follow through with the Segwit2x agreement. Mistrust isn't the only reason some users continue to support the BIP 148 path. Some believe the expectation of a UASF activation could change what mining pools do and whether or not they follow through with upgrades to the network. Lifthrasir referenced litecoin as an example, noting how mining pools united around SegWit to upgrade the lesser-known cryptocurrency earlier this year. He believes miners only did so after the litecoin community rallied around a UASF, since this type of soft fork could undermine miner's perceived influence. ""To me, Segwit2x is equivalent to the litecoin roundtable, a way for miners to adopt SegWit before the users do it for them,"" Lifthrasir said. He believes the same is already happening on bitcoin. ""BIP 148 is already succeeding in two ways. First, the current all-time high for miners signaling for SegWit is a result of the threat of BIP 148,"" he said. The original SegWit stalled for months at about 30% hashrate, but around the time BIP148 saw increased interest, this support saw an increase to roughly 45%. Although Lifthrasir isn't taking the mining pool's Segwit2x pledge for granted, he believes they probably will trigger the change since it's in their own interest. This idea could be a relieving thought, as support for BIP 148 hasn't grown very much over the past month. And while it's success relies in large part on the support of major bitcoin exchanges and companies, with two weeks to go, most have not taken a public position on it. If not enough of the bitcoin ecosystem supports the BIP148 chain, bitcoin could split into two competing assets. That's why BIP 148 is highly controversial. While Bitcoin Core contributors, for example, are supportive of upgrading bitcoin to support SegWit, many are wary of doing it the way BIP 148 lays out. Some of bitcoin's most active protocol developers don't support BIP 148. Bitcoin protocol startup Chaincode co-founder Alex Morcos and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell are both outspoken opponents. And Bitcoin Core contributor David Harding called it a ""boycott on steroids."" Although deadlines for both BIP 148 and SegWit2x are approaching, there are other longer-term options for boosting transaction capacity, one by way of a different UASF. The upside is that these could be less disruptive in that they require less action from mining pools. The downside is the longer time to activation. Still, despite this divide, some developers and users plan to move forward with BIP 148 on August 1. In this way, it's perhaps been more of a user-driven change, with users such as Coinkite co-founder and CEO Rodolfo Novak and developer Damian Mee advocating for the specific proposal change from early on. Lifthrasir concluded: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which acted as organizer for the SegWit2x proposal and has an ownership stake in Blockstream.  Breaking ties image via Shutterstock

Bitcoin crossed the $40bn mark for market cap, ether rallied over 700% and the combined value of all blockchain-based tokens in existence shot north of $105bn (exceeding financial giants like Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley). Without a doubt, the crypto tokens underlying a growing universe of blockchain protocols now comprises its own independent asset class, unique from any that came before it. And the proof is in the numbers. Total blockchain venture capital for the year has already been exceeded by ICO fundings for the first time, and the trend has only accelerated since. It's now routine for ICOs to raise more than $100m, with multiple projects within the last 30 days accumulating nine-digit sums (based on the current value of the bitcoin and ether contributed, of course). Most have set all-time crowdfunding records, only to have them broken days or weeks later. In short, a new wave of investment interest has led both retail investors and institutional funds to line up to take advantage of the growing appetite for new tokens. As part of CoinDesk's forthcoming State of Blockchain Q2 2017 report, we're seeking to better understand how the blockchain industry views these history-making trends – from both a positive and a negative perspective. Are we in the midst of a cryptocurrency bubble? Would ICO mania come crashing down with a drop in bitcoin and ether prices?

                            Bitcoin and the Benefits of 'Coopetition'                        ",Jameson Lopp,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-benefits-coopetition-adversarial-environments/,"Jameson Lopp is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of statoshi.info and founder of bitcoinsig.com. In this opinion piece, Lopp makes an impassioned argument for the need for more cooperation between the players in the bitcoin space and the putting aside of vitriol and rivalry in the interests of growing a system to last for many years to come. As I have extensively argued in my writings, it's not possible for any of us to fully understand bitcoin, and it may not even be possible for us to steer it onto a course we desire. We're learning more about the system as we go along. Regardless of what point you may be at on this chart, we’re all huddled together on this life raft in an ocean of financial turmoil, trying to figure out how to build it into a battle cruiser. We all know how the story begins. On an obscure cryptography mailing list in 2008, someone using the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto posted a white paper, stating, ""I've been working on a new electronic cash system that's fully peer-to-peer, with no trusted third party."" Nakamoto was far from the first to propose electronic cash, and many cypherpunks had grown weary of the slew of failed attempts over the decades.  Many of those who responded to Satoshi poked and prodded the proposal, claiming that it could never work in practice due to fundamentally flawed assumptions in the scalability or game theory of the system.  The names of those first few respondents to Satoshi will be lost to history. The name of the man who responded differently shall never be forgotten: Hal Finney. Where most cypherpunks cynically saw only the potential for failure, he saw the potential for success. Never mind that Hal had previously devised his own system of digital money called Reusable Proof of Work, which was also based upon Hashcash. He was focused on the big picture.  Hal realized that he too had once thought that systems would fail for similar reasons, but he had been wrong before and wasn't going to make that mistake again. Hal cooperated with Satoshi over the coming months, finding many bugs in Satoshi’s code and making it more robust. He mined many bitcoins with his CPU and received the first ever bitcoin transaction between peers. Hal went a step beyond being an adversary to the proposal; he brought a builder’s mindset to the game. I bring this all up because today I see many bitcoiners acting like the first respondents to Satoshi – overly pessimistic from years of adversarial thinking. When you're involved in public discourse about the future of bitcoin, I hope you’ll ask yourself: ""What would Hal do?"" Several years ago, Balaji Srinivasan [CEO and co-founder of 21] gave an introduction to bitcoin presentation in which he stated that bitcoin mining is a ""coopetition."" What he meant by this was that miners are competing 24/7/365 to find the next valid block and yet simultaneously they are cooperating to secure and extend the same blockchain. This got me to thinking: perhaps we've been going about this all wrong. Perhaps we've fallen into a trap of our own making because we're too focused on competition and, by throwing cooperation out the window, we are missing opportunities to grow this ecosystem. I make no claim to being an expert in game theory, but my understanding is that every game is comprised of the same basic elements: Let's have a look at the players and rules with respect to the game called bitcoin. The four types of players in games of capitalism are customers, suppliers, competitors and complementors. It is important to realize that none of the players in the game are fixed. An effective strategy may entail bringing in new players or pushing out existing ones. For example, if you only have one supplier, you may want to pay for other suppliers to enter the game in order to make the raw material market for your business more competitive, or even to commoditize your supplier's products. On the other hand, if you are considering becoming a new player as a supplier, you should try to get compensated up front by your future customers for the competition you create, because you’ll be saving them money. Within the players element, we can use the concept of the ""value net"" to express the relations amongst the players.  The value net is a way to explain the interdependencies amongst the players. There are both vertical and horizontal symmetries in the value net. Vertically, it demonstrates that users and suppliers are both value creators. Organizations should listen to the needs of both players in order to maximize the value of the system. Horizontally, complementors are just the mirror image of competitors. Customers value your product more when there are many complementors, whereas they value your product less when there are many substitutors. Understanding this relationship highlights a deficiency in common competitive practices: only focusing on how to eliminate one's competitors. Instead of thinking of business as war, organizations should also attempt to develop commodity complementors, which in the long-term increases the overall value to their customers. By understanding these two symmetries, the value net gives us greater potential for successful application of game theory. Instead of focusing on only the conventional players like customers and competitors, the value net shows that organizations actually have four player types to target when developing strategies. I brainstormed a bit, trying to think of what some of the different players are in bitcoin's value net. This is by no means a comprehensive list, and I hope some of you can contribute to it so that we can improve our understanding of bitcoin's game theory! Users increase the value of the system by creating demand and network effect: Suppliers increase value by adding resources to the system: Competitors decrease the value of system by acting as substitutes: Complementors increase the value of the system by bundling other utility with bitcoin. These include: An interesting revelation we see from the value net is that there are three player types we can target to increase the value of the system without having to threaten our competitors. I pose to you that these paths are probably easier and will have a greater return on investment. Remember that we are vastly outnumbered and out-capitalized by our competitors at this point. We've heard that 21, Bitmain, Blockchain, Blockstream, Coinbase, nChain, and plenty of other entities in this space have hundreds of millions of dollars in their coffers, but that's still a drop in the bucket compared to what we are facing. I pose to you that we don't want strong competitors to feel threatened by bitcoin until it's too late for them to respond. The crypto asset industry is in competition, but not just within itself – we’re in competition with many other industries. For example, we’re in competition with all high-tech industries over a limited supply of software engineers. As such, we should desire to foster a welcoming community for developers. I'd point to ethereum as a good model in that regard.  In terms of software development, we already see ""coopetition"" amongst developers on a single team. Unlike corporate software development, there are no project managers or architects passing down feature requirements and specifications from on high. Instead, multiple developers may propose similar competing changes that attempt to solve the same perceived problems. If a proposal begins to gain traction, other developers will jump in and probe the idea, trying to find weaknesses and cooperating with the proposer to improve it. On a related note, I’ve observed a fundamental conflict between how the vast majority of software development works versus how public consensus networks operate. Most software developers take the approach of envisioning how they want the system to work, writing the code, and then deploying it. In bitcoin, you have some groups of developers who also take that approach, historically with poor results. Then you have other groups of developers who consider the existing rules of the system to be constraints within which they have to work in order to be able to deploy changes; that methodology tends to be more successful. Now, I'm sure that this is a particularly contentious point and many of you have changes you desire to see implemented in bitcoin that have been frustratingly failing to activate. Perhaps we can just dismiss it as another inefficiency of a decentralized system, but it seems that it could have a chilling effect upon development and result in a lot of wasted resources working on features that end up never being used. As a former supporter of Bitcoin XT, I know full well the feeling of seeing months of work and waiting go up in smoke. I hope that we can break out of this cycle of failed initiatives.  A plethora of businesses based upon the bitcoin platform have emerged and many of them are in direct competition with each other for customers seeking to fill specific use cases. And yet, many of these businesses form partnerships and trade services with each other in order to form mutually beneficial relationships that leverage the strengths of each business. I can tell you that this is certainly true for us at BitGo as we wish to provide our services to as much of the ecosystem as possible. It's clear that the root cause of the rift in the scaling debate is conflicting needs between different types of bitcoin users, and enterprises that service users who transact smaller values are feeling the pressure to improve their customer experience. As a result, many are trying to change the rules of the bitcoin game, while other players in the game consider a rule change to be hazardous to the value of their own use cases. Due to the strength of the status quo in this game, we find ourselves at an impasse. People within the ecosystem broadcast their thoughts across mailing lists, forums, chat rooms and social media. They argue about the nature of bitcoin and the direction it can go, trying to earn respect and social capital. Unfortunately this process has degenerated during the years of scaling debate.  Tribalism has taken a toll on the community and fractured discussion; many developers left the bitcoin mailing list to avoid drama and harassment. I've been tracking mailing list activity and it continues to decline.    I think one of the greatest problems is the classification of folks as ""small blockers"" or ""large blockers,"" amongst more derogatory names being slung around. This is a very nuanced discussion; we should avoid grouping people together based upon similar viewpoints. In fact, it's probably best to avoid talking about people or groups of people at all. We should be talking about ideas, not people. The vitriol and tribalism has led to communication breakdowns. I've lost count of how many times I've had people privately message me to let me know that they aren’t responding to a recent conversation because they blocked or muted one of the primary participants. The blocking has even gotten to the point that it causes misunderstandings. Take, for example, a recent Twitter blunder where ""Alice"" attacked ""Bob"" for saying that he thought bitcoin needed a CEO, but Bob was actually arguing against bitcoin needing a CEO. Alice lost that context because ""Charlie"" had blocked her, thus entire portions of the tweet thread were invisible to her and the meaning drastically changed. In this situation no one is to blame and yet everyone is to blame. Similar problems have happened in the past on the /r/Bitcoin subreddit when the removal of comments by moderators combined with complex CSS to automatically expand collapsed threads also caused portions of the conversation to be imperceptibly removed, thus changing its meaning.   I speak from personal experience here, as someone who has had posts removed from /r/Bitcoin, been attacked by trolls on every platform I’ve used, been banned from /r/buttcoin for posting inconvenient facts, and even as a moderator of the Bitcoin XT subreddit. I consider every bitcoin-specific forum to be flawed:  they all tend to be skewed due to the tribalism of either the moderators or the users, who are nearly guaranteed to have some sort of vested interest in seeing their personal vision of bitcoin promoted. That’s why these days I mostly stick to Twitter, where no one stifles my speech. It seems to me that back when we were all using the same few forums we were doing a better job at fostering coopetition, but now the focus on competition has divided the community and wasted our most valuable resource: time. Cooperation increases value and increased value can foster increased cooperation, creating a virtuous cycle. If you spew vitriol at bitcoiners online, you aren't just hurting your target – you're hurting us all. I mentioned that this presentation was inspired by a reference to mining coopetition, though at this point I think it's worth digging deeper into this example so that we might compare it to the other forms of coopetition already covered. In the early days, folks were solo mining with CPUs and then GPUs, but it didn’t take them long to figure out that cooperating and pooling resources offered more consistent returns. Pooled mining also expanded the crypto economy by creating a business opportunity for people with the operational skills to maintain a reliable and trustworthy pool.  As you're surely aware, there are a handful of companies that now control a significant portion of bitcoin's total hashing power. You're also aware that any entity that gains over 50% of hashing power (or possibly around 30% with selfish mining strategies) can effectively control which blocks get added to the tip of the blockchain over a long period of time. So, it's not a stretch to imagine that a handful of mining companies could communicate in private and decide to form a cartel by working together to orphan all blocks minted by entities other than themselves. They could thus shut out the rest of the competition and split a larger slice of the block rewards and fees amongst a smaller number of miners. Why don’t we see this cartelization happening? I pose to you that it’s because they know that bitcoin is more valuable when are building on top of each other's work rather than throwing away large chunks of work for a short-term gain. Miners are cooperating to secure and extend the same blockchain; if some miners change their protocol to be incompatible with the rest and the blockchain forks as a result, these two sets of miners are no longer in coopetition – they are only in competition. This drastically changes the game theory and equilibrium of the system and also reduces security because they’re no longer cooperating to extend the same chain, thus making each new chain fork cheaper to attack computationally. This is but one of many reasons why we should be cautious to avoid contentious forks. Bitcoin is a very interesting game that none of us are being forced to play – we all have our own incentives. But I think that a fundamental disconnect between different sides in the scalability debate is that they are playing different games.  Those who view bitcoin as digital gold and accept a trade-off of higher transaction fees in return for lower cost of full blockchain validation believe that the rules of the protocol are intentionally hard to change and we should work within the confines of the current rules to improve the system’s scalability without compromising forward compatibility. Those who view bitcoin as a payment system that needs to have low transaction fees in order to be competitive and reach mass adoption believe that the rules of the system must change in order for it to evolve and increase in utility and value. Neither of these views is necessarily wrong, they're just different games. It's a lot harder to foster coopetition when you're not playing the same game. Is it possible that this is an irreconcilable difference? Sure. Bitcoin is fundamentally based upon ideology; we just use science to bring our ideology into reality by running a fully validating node that automatically enforces the rules to which we agree. But I hope you agree with me that this game is more enjoyable and more valuable when it has more players. Should bitcoin endure a permanent chain split, I fear it would set precedent for more fracturing in the future, causing further loss of network effect and greater confusion over the identity of bitcoin for mainstream users. With regard to rule changes, I think it's worth looking at the competition and how they end up being affected. I pose to you that any rule change bitcoin makes can also be made by its competition in the crypto ecosystem. If bitcoin can change to support huge blocks, what's to stop litecoin or ethereum or whatever from doing the same? I suspect that changing the protocol to target low on-chain transaction fees will effectively result in a cryptocurrency price war with a race to the bottom, and price wars tend to end in pyrrhic victories.  If you're not familiar with ""A Cypherpunk’s Manifesto"", give it a read. While privacy is but one of many aspects integral to bitcoin, I think the spirit of coopetition rings true in Eric Hughes’ writing. I find these excerpts to be particularly relevant: Bitcoin was born from the efforts of cypherpunks. Cypherpunks know the value of open coopetition. I know there's a lot of bad blood in this space and you may be tempted to attack individuals who have offended you, but let’s not waste energy perpetuating a vicious cycle. Yes, this is an adversarial environment, but in order to foster a constructive environment it must be adversarial in the intellectual sense, not the emotional sense. We have too much left to build to spend time fueling petty squabbles. What would Hal do? In highly segmented industries with strong network effects, such as the technology industry, coopetition may be the only way to avoid stagnation. It is often difficult in the tech industry to get new products off the ground; the market demands technical standards but it can take years of fruitless, cutthroat competition that inhibits the overall health of the market before a clear winner emerges. Coopetition can help us avoid that by finding win-win scenarios.  I'm sure you’re all familiar with this chart showing the tech adoption lifecycle. Personally, I think we’re still in the innovation phase. Coopetition can be an extremely valuable strategy for technology dependent upon network effects when they're still trying to bootstrap. Since the early market is small, competing for market share does not make much sense. Instead, in the early market stage, we should focus on creating demand and getting past the tipping point. Coopetition can create a win-win situation for all involved by actually lowering the tipping point for reaching the mainstream market. If we accept the premise that we don't have the resources to quickly ramp up the entire ecosystem to mass adoption, how do we find the path to get there? I'd argue that once you convince someone to store value in bitcoin, they are incentivized to use their skills and resources to help make the system more valuable. In this manner, we can bootstrap the system organically. What if, instead of targeting low-value use cases during this bootstrapping phase, we adopted a Tesla-esque strategy instead? That is: court the wealthiest of entities to be early adopters in this system and thus incentivize them to pay for the hard part – innovation of the ecosystem. This could be high-net-worth individuals looking to diversify their assets, hedge funds, or even tiny nation states with currencies that are now dwarfed by bitcoin. At time of writing, there are 140 countries with M1 money supplies smaller than bitcoin's money supply. Surely some of them have far more to gain than to lose by taking a first mover advantage in the global transition to crypto assets. The tricky part here is that bitcoin doesn’t have a marketing department. It's up to each of us to spread it like a mind virus; we would need to find people already in the community who can build a bridge to these high-value networks we may wish to target. If you think you fit this criterion or are interested in pursuing the idea, please contact me. Some people argue that there's an incentive problem with protocol development. Many contributors are unpaid volunteers; so what if, instead of relying upon a poorly defined process for funding protocol development with a scattering of grants and hires by for-profit companies, we created a multisig fund to which enterprises and high-net-worth investors contribute and control in order to hire full-time protocol devs and/or post bounties for feature development? I don’t think such an idea necessarily needs to be baked into the protocol itself as some cryptocurrencies have done. These are just a few random thoughts; there are certainly many more unexplored possibilities. I suppose what I'm really trying to say here is that we should take a long-term view of how to play the bitcoin game. We aren't building a technology that we want to take down a path that causes it to fail or become obsolete in a decade. We're building a system that must last for generations. The lifespan of the average fiat currency is 27 years – imagine the global confidence bitcoin will acquire if we can exceed that mark. I'm confident that we can find safe ways to take us down the path to mass adoption – all that is required is creativity and perseverance. Bitcoin clearly can't be everything that we all want it to be at this stage, otherwise we risk it become nothing any of us want it to be. We're currently working with what amounts to a very small pie. Many of you are rightfully frustrated because you are watching use cases being priced out of bitcoin, effectively shrinking that slice of the pie. You may feel powerless to stop portions of bitcoin's user base from defecting to other crypto assets. For your own peace of mind, I recommend letting go of anger and frustration. Accept that bitcoin is beyond your control and instead focus on figuring out the things that you can control with regard to bitcoin's value net. This is how we can grow the pie. We can always compete later over how to slice it up. When developers, businesses and users switch from coopetition to competition, it makes us all weaker. The great thing about coopetition is that it allows us to leverage free market capitalism to accelerate innovation, while still retaining the strength afforded to us by network effects. We're all huddled together on a life raft in an ocean of financial turmoil; instead of waging war with each other and splintering the raft, let's build a warship so that we may raid the coffers of the overconfident bankers in their overladen galleons. My fellow bitcoiners, I look forward to coopeting with you all for many years to come. Vires in numeris.

Indian officials have been meeting for months to develop a legal framework for digital currencies, forming a special task force in April to study the issue and develop possible options. The question of legality for the tech under Indian law has been subject to speculation in the past, especially following public statements that, at one point, were interpreted as a blanket ban on bitcoin. Regional news service The Hindu reports that new details on that process are emerging, including the possibility of taxes. Notably, according to one official's account, the topic of banning cryptocurrencies was indeed broached during a recent meeting – but in the end, the proposal received little support. The official told the publication: Trading activity may also come under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which regulates the country's securities market. Ultimately, according to The Hindu, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies may come to been viewed as kinds of digital assets under Indian law. Indian flag image via Shutterstock

 As bitcoin heads into July, the protocol stands on the cusp of major changes to its code. The result of years of heated discussion on how to expand the capabilities of bitcoin for greater transaction volumes, two key proposals now stand on the verge of potentially disrupting or upgrading the network. While generally described as a ""civil war,"" the battle over bitcoin's technical roadmap is more nuanced. Yet, that's not to say there couldn't be real consequences. To help readers understand this turbulent time, we're assembling content, both new and old, to serve as a guide to the debate and a real-time way to track news and updates. In the days to come, we'll be updating this post as a resource. We're happy to consider collaborations and improvements as we seek to inform the world about changes and movements in bitcoin code. ""Either the $40bn economic network ... is on the verge of the biggest change in its history, or the most advanced scaling compromise is headed toward its biggest political failure.""  Penned by CoinDesk's Pete Rizzo and Alyssa Hertig, our overview piece helps frame the debate, introducing key concepts and timelines. For a more detailed overview, we've also compiled a chart of major timelines and outcomes.  Other media outlets have since offered their takes on the situation ahead. Below, is a list of our favorites. Recommended reading: Along the way, we'll release new guides and explainers aimed at taking high-level looks at some of the more granular aspects of the code proposals. The most widely supported (and most controversial proposal), Segwit2x has perhaps the greatest chance of being activated. In this explainer piece, Alyssa Hertig outlines (in simple terms) what the proposal aims to do, what inspired it and how it works.  In response to perceptions miners and startups are pushing their view on the bitcoin roadmap, some users have threatened revolt. Here, Alyssa Hertig explains the proposal and its possible implications.  A complement to Segwit2x, BIP 91 may well end up mediating between the two proposals. Here, Alyssa Hertig and Bailey Reutzel outline how it works, who's running the code and what will happen if (and when) it goes live.  Recommended reading: Once you're past the 101, you may want to dive deeper to understand the cultural and intellectual underpinnings of the debate.  Here, Pete Rizzo wades into explaining the influence miners, startups and developers have on bitcoin, exploring what keeps these groups together, as well as the issues keeping them at odds. This isn't to say the scaling debate is a new story.  In fact, disagreements have gone on so long, many have feared (or hoped) they would never come to any head. Here, Alyssa Hertig outlines the reasons why. But, who doesn't want to scale? It turns out, there might be valid and well-reasoned arguments for this outlook.

The bitcoin community was abuzz yesterday when, during an appearance before a Congressional committee by Federal Reserve chair Janet Yellen, an attendee held aloft a ""buy bitcoin"" sign. The image of the sign quickly went viral, though the attendee and his friend were ultimately asked to leave by a staffer. Soon after his appearance, it emerged that the individual is a friend of a cryptocurrency trader who tweets under the handle CryptoEthan. He posted a picture of the person – soon known as the ""Bitcoin Sign Guy"" – who, in addition to holding up the now-infamous sign, shared a bitcoin address as well. As of press time, that address has garnered 6.32570673 BTC, an amount worth just under $15,000 at current prices. While most of the transactions involved, numbering 556 according to Blockchain.info, were small in scale, one notable contribution was for 1 BTC. The photo that included the address was ultimately deleted at the Bitcoin Sign Guy's request, though he later visited the nonprofit advocacy group Coin Center, which is headquartered in Washington, DC. The viral activity spurred several scam attempts, with some accounts posting Photoshopped versions of the original picture with new addresses. Image Source: Twitter

                            Beyond Segwit2x: Paul Sztorc Thinks Bitcoin Needs a New Scaling Roadmap                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/beyond-segwit2x-paul-sztorc-thinks-bitcoin-needs-new-scaling-roadmap/,"As bitcoin approaches a particularly tense and uncertain period, it might seem like a strange time to map out the cryptocurrency's future at all. Eyes are glued on two competing scaling projects aimed at boosting bitcoin's transaction capacity, which are set to come to a head at the end of the month. The best case? Bitcoin could see a smooth capacity increase. The worst? Bitcoin could split into two networks and competing assets. Yet, that isn't stopping developers from stepping back from the current quagmire to look at the longer term technical picture and how bitcoin could be improved over the next few years. In fact, most bitcoin developers don't seem interested in the debate at all, focusing instead on a range of other forward-looking projects. One example of this long-range focus came Tuesday when developer Paul Sztorc proposed a new scaling roadmap to a popular bitcoin mailing list, charting out an admittedly rough path for future bitcoin development. In conversation with CoinDesk, Sztorc stressed the roadmap is very far from official as it’s ""just one man’s work."" He even admitted to not agreeing with all of his own roadmap's contents. But, he wanted to open up a conversation about what experts think bitcoin's next steps are. To begin, Sztorc's new roadmap continues to include Segregated Witness (SegWit), the code optimization at the center of bitcoin's scaling debate, but also outlines a timeline for the Lightning Network, transaction compression and Schnorr signatures. The Lightning Network Network could help to increase capacity by allowing transactions to be made without being broadcast to the entire network. Sztorc argued it's complete, except the implementation still needs SegWit to activate to function best. Schnorr signatures could shrink the size of transactions, further boosting bitcoin's limited capacity. Sztorc put down a tentative deadline of Q4 of 2016. The roadmap also includes his own proposal, Drivechain. A sidechain proposal, Drivechain acts as a two-way peg, allowing participants to move their bitcoins to a sidechain while remaining a part of the bitcoin network. The goal is that it will not negatively affect the main network while enabling it to host other assets, but there's been some discussion about whether this is possible. While Sztorc admits to be campaigning for his proposal (and also a distinction between ""scalability"" and ""capacity""), and a few developers have given the idea their blessing. ""Maybe everyone will hate it. I don't know,"" Sztorc told CoinDesk. Overall, Sztorc's goal is to refresh an older roadmap. In December 2015, Blockstream CTO and Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell wrote an email to a popular bitcoin developer list outlining various promising methods of boosting transaction capacity. You could argue that it spread to become bitcoin's de-facto scaling roadmap, as many users and those in the technical community often link to it as an informal guide. But, in Sztorc's opinion, it's age is starting to show; many of the changes Maxwell outlined have since been pushed through. He told CoinDesk: The idea of a new plan sounds innocuous enough, right? Yet, some Bitcoin Core contributors responded to Sztorc's proposal with reluctance, making it clear they believe the original roadmap did more harm than good. Maxwell, author of the old roadmap, remarked that he wished he had not posted it at all, going as far as to argue that it ""harmed progress in our community."" ""What I wrote was carefully constructed as a personal view of how things might work out. It never claimed to be a project roadmap,"" he said. Maxwell detailed reasons for opposing Sztorc's proposal, namely that many of the technologies listed are not far enough along for developers to have a clear idea of whether they are reasonable to promote. Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop was also hesitant to support a new roadmap for the same reason Maxwell does in that the deadlines provided could be construed as solid and agreed upon, leading to confusion. This is especially important, he continued, because Maxwell's original roadmap has been used to distort Bitcoin Core’s point of view. ""I think it's very quick to reach the point of unethical to advocate a perspective that there's guarantee [that] things will happen according to that timeline,"" Bishop wrote. Still, Sztorc suggests the new roadmap is needed because Bitcoin Core developers are not sufficiently communicating with the outside world about which technical proposals they support. Communication has long been perceived an issue in the community, especially given that technical changes to bitcoin are often complex and difficult to understand. Some even argue miscommunication between various stakeholders has contributed to bitcoin's current state, with users supporting competing scaling proposals that could lead to a split of the network. Of course, Bitcoin Core is a loose group, composed of open-source developers who each have their own opinions and often disagree on technical issues. Yet, as is the case with Segregated Witness (a technical optimization at the heart of bitcoin's current debate), developers sometimes do share similar views about the best way forward. According to Sztorc, Maxwell's roadmap highlighted where there was consensus from experts. He believes his new roadmap is much like that. While the ideas might not be ready for primetime yet, they are all ideas prominent developers are working on today. ""There should be clarity,"" he said, arguing a new roadmap might achieve that. Although, he stressed the proposal is by no means complete. He invited suggestions, rewrites or even several competing roadmaps highlighting expert's visions. Sztorc concluded: Paul Sztorc image via the Scaling Bitcoin conference

Bitpanda first announced the service on July 11, and Österreichische Post later confirmed the news in an email with CoinDesk. As a result of the partnership, customers are now able to purchase €50, €100 and €500 vouchers at 400 official branches of the postal company, as well as its 1,300 partners across the country. The vouchers can then be redeemed for cryptocurrencies through Bitpanda's online platform. Bitpanda co-CEO Eric Demuth said that the offline transaction fee will be kept at 3 percent, the same as the exchange's online exchange fee, in a hope to push the adoption mainstream. While such a large partner could be seen as a potential profit driver, both sides did not confirm the exact split of the revenue generated from the offline transactions. According to local news source derStandard.at, Bitpanda is expecting the collaboration to scale up the transaction volume to €200m, which could equal to approximately €6m revenue from transaction fees.

Arthur Vayloyan, global head of products and services for Falcon, said in a statement: As part of the announcement, Falcon also revealed it has installed a bitcoin ATM in the lobby of its Zurich headquarters that will be open for public use. The integration reportedly came about following discussion with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). While it's rare for a bank to openly embrace cryptocurrency, Switzerland has emerged as active in supporting blockchain-related initiatives in both the public and private sectors. Just yesterday, for example, the Swiss Federal Council revealed the regulator is ""swiftly"" moving toward a legal designation of digital currencies. In addition, the city of Zug, which has openly expressed its intent to help move forward the adoption of blockchain technology, and which is backing an industry consortium called the Crypto Valley Association, recently revealed it intends to launch a digital identity service that utilizes the tech this fall.

As chief of the US central bank, Yellen also spoke about a recent semi-annual report delivered to Congress by the Fed. And while Yellen made headlines by expressing her willingness to raise interest rates amidst a healthier economic climate (following years of near-zero rates instituted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis), it was one attendee who drew notice on social media after he held up a ""buy bitcoin"" sign two rows behind where Yellen was seated. A screen grab of the moment was tweeted by CNBC staffer Steve Kopack, and later shared by others who have been watching Yellen's testimony before Congress. The identity of the person who held up the sign isn't immediately clear. Yet in a follow-up tweet, Wall Street Journal national economics correspondent Nick Timiraos reported that the individual, along with another, had left the room ""after a staffer made some instruction to them."" Video published by Bloomberg shows the two individuals being spoken to by a staffer. Yellen – who told Congress in 2014 that the Fed ""doesn't have authority to supervise or regulate bitcoin in any way"" – remarked earlier this year that she believes blockchain is an ""important technology"". Under her leadership, the Fed has also moved to publish some of its internal research into the technology, releasing its first report on the subject in December.

                            Explainer: What Is SegWit2x and What Does It Mean for Bitcoin?                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/explainer-what-is-segwit2x-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/,"As two proposals for boosting bitcoin's transaction capacity approach key deadlines, one proposal, known as SegWit2x, has perhaps garnered the most attention. The plan, first proposed in May, quickly won favor among many of bitcoin's startups and mining pools. Yet, it has also emerged as contentious in some quarters, owing to its specific goals and technical construction. But, what's at the heart of the arguments for and against? First, SegWit2x seeks to upgrade bitcoin in two ways: Understanding the ins and outs of the proposal from here can be challenging. While technical, the proposal is also political and philosophical (and some would argue, personal). Still, the specifics of the debate revolve around basic facts about current network design and performance. These include: To begin, SegWit2x is not the first proposal for scaling bitcoin's transaction capacity. SegWit2x, though, differs in some key ways. These include: As outlined above, these ideas include: SegWit was officially released last November, giving network users the option to run it. But, for technical reasons, it required mining pools to activate the change, and they have been hesitant to adopt the change for a variety of reasons. SegWit2x is being deployed in its testnet to all working group members on July 14, and the period for live adoption starts on July 21, with an August 1 deadline for necessary support to avoid issues. In favor of SegWit2x are a significant number of high-profile bitcoin businesses and individuals, most of whom are more closely affiliated with the ecosystem's startup and investment community. These include: A full list of supporters can be found in the original SegWit2x agreement announcement. Still, others oppose the plan, including: The actively updated Bitcoin Wiki page offers a longer list of those who support, oppose and are undecided. Looking ahead, the outcome of SegWit2x will depend on how many users ultimately adopt the proposal. Several different outcomes could emerge, including: As is to be expected from such a large ecosystem, different users have different opinions on the best course of action, perhaps owing to the competing ideologies underlying their participation in bitcoin to begin with. As such, SegWit2x is not the only scaling proposal receiving attention today. Several alternative proposals have been introduced that could be enacted on the network in the coming month. SegWit2x is competing with another proposal: BIP 148. Developers have worked to make these two compatible, so, if enough mining pools support SegWit2x before August 1, bitcoin should avoid a split. Yet, without the necessary support for SegWit2x, and an activation of BIP148, the network could fork. And a split is what many bitcoin users are most concerned about, leading them to worry about the SegWit2x proposal in general. In light of these anxieties, one of two things could happen to user's bitcoin directly: Another longer term issue is that all users will need to upgrade their software in support of the 2MB hard fork component of SegWit2x, or bitcoin could split into two competing assets with different users. A more detailed version of the SegWit2x scaling timeline, and the potential ramifications, can be found on Bitcoin Magazine. As the SegWit2x code gets deployed on the testnet on July 14, and the period for adoption starts on July 21, many will be keeping a close eye on the evolving situation. There are various places to track the project's development. The SegWit2x mailing list can be found here (while public, only members who are invited can post to the list). Further, the SegWit2x code implementation, known as ""BTC1"", can be found here. Community members can follow how many nodes are running SegWit2x software here and how many mining pools support the proposal here, as a means of keeping an eye on whether it achieves enough support.

                            Gambling on a Hard Fork: Will Roger Ver Take up a High-Stakes Bitcoin Wager?                        ",Amy Castor,https://www.coindesk.com/gambling-hard-fork-will-roger-ver-take-high-stakes-bitcoin-wager/,"Suppose you wanted to bet on the outcome of a future bitcoin hard fork, how would you go about doing that? That very question came up last spring on BitcoinTalk when Roger Ver, the controversial investor and proponent of a particular brand of bitcoin scaling, gave a nod to a challenge from another investor. The wager? Which of two blockchains would be more valuable if bitcoin were to split. The challenge sought to speculate on the future of Bitcoin Unlimited (BU), a proposal for removing the bitcoin block size limit. (This was before SegWit2x came into play, although both protocol upgrades propose bigger blocks and require a hard fork to implement.) Intrigued by the bet, and the amount of money Ver was willing to put on the table ($120m-worth of bitcoin at the time), researchers Patrick McCorry at University College London and Ethan Heilman at Boston University, along with Andrew Miller, assistant professor at University of Illinois, put their heads together to figure out a solution. And to that end, they have released a paper outlining the technical details needed to carry through with the wager. Before explaining how that protocol works, though, let's go back to the bet. Back in March, ""Loaded,"" a pseudonymous investor who holds a substantial bag of bitcoins, put forth a challenge to Ver, who, at the time was pushing hard for BU. ""@RogerVer let's make a deal, 1 for 1 trade. At least 60k, possibly up to 130k, my BTU for your BTC,"" Loaded wrote ""The offer is open to [Bitmain CEO] Jihan Wu as well,"" he followed, noting the mining magnate Ver was said to be working closely with at the time. ""Consider it primarily as a vote of no confidence in the Bitcoin Unlimited software and development team as it currently stands."" While Wu remained silent, two days later, to the surprise of many in the bitcoin community, Ver responded: And, since then, the developer community has been kicking around ideas on how exactly to handle the technical details of the swap. Adding to the urgency is an increasing likelihood that a hard fork could occur. Currently, 85% and 42% of miners are signaling their readiness for SegWit2x and Bitcoin Unlimited, respectively. As in any hard fork, if the bitcoin blockchain splits into two competing networks, the result will be two types of digital assets, as well. So, in the case of a BU hard fork, a person holding bitcoin on the original chain would end up with an equal amount of BU bitcoin, or BTU, on the alternate chain. Over time, those coins would develop different market values, depending on the chain more users gravitated to. The situation would be similar to the aftermath of ethereum's DAO hard fork, which resulted in two assets: ether and ether classic. To better understand the problem that McCorry, Heilman and Miller were striving to solve, it helps to take a closer look at how the deal between Loaded and Ver would unfold. First, each party would need to put aside 60,000 BTC prior to the split. Once the split into two chains occurs, both parties will end up with coins on both blockchains, leaving each with 60,000 BTC and 60,000 BTU. At that point, Loaded would trade 60,000 of his BTC on one chain with 60,000 of Roger's BTU on the other. Once the trade was completed, Loaded would walk away with 120,000 BTC and Roger with 120,000 BTU. And, the gamble is, who will be the richer man as a result? The scheme is a tough one to pull off, however. Although atomic cross-chain swaps are the most obvious way to handle the trade, that solution would only work after the hard fork when there would be two chains. Before the hard fork, there will only be one chain. So, the trick is finding a way for both parties to commit to the trade prior the fork and then swap after the fork. And, because bitcoin has not yet activated the SegWit upgrade, the solution also needs to account for transaction malleability, a problem that adds several extra steps to the setup. But Heilman and McCorry, who spoke to CoinDesk about their paper, said they've had a good time trying to arrive at a solution and see malleability as bringing more to the party. ""It's way more complicated, but it’s also more fun,"" said Heilman. The solution set forth by the researchers is a modified version of an atomic swap protocol that relies on two bitcoin transaction encumbrances: CheckTimeLockVerify (CTLV) and hashlocks. CTLV sets transactions at a future point in time, while hashlocks require a ""secret"" (pre-image of a hash) to unlock a transaction output. It's also worth noting that the protocol will work not just on a BU hard fork, but any hard fork that has what's called ""replay protection,"" a way of ensuring that a transaction occurring on one blockchain after a split does not get repeated on the other. Explaining the swap as it relates to Ver ('Alice') and Loaded ('Bob'), the setup goes something like this: First, Alice computes a ""secret"" (pre-image) and hashes it. After that, three transactions (see below) need to be created and signed by both parties prior to the fork. This way, when the blockchain splits, Alice and Bob only have to broadcast their transactions to get their deposits. To commit to the trade, Alice and Bob each deposit 60,000 BTC into a ""funding transaction."" That transaction has three outputs. One output is linked to Alice's coins, the other to Bob's coins, and a third acts as a fail-safe, allowing Bob to cancel if Alice neglects to sign any of the off-chain transactions required to set up the entire trade. To ensure the money is held safely until after the fork, each output has a time lock. Now, with the money safely set aside, both parties can move on to add their digital signatures to two more transactions. These will determine how the money in the funding transaction will be spent after the fork. The ""swap transaction"" is actually a pair of transactions. When triggered, one transaction takes 120,000 BTU from the BU fork and sends it to Alice, while the other takes 120,000 BTC from the BTC  fork and sends it to Bob. And, to ensure each transaction only works in its intended chain, the protocol calls on the replay protection already included in the hard fork protocol upgrade. This way, for instance, Alice cannot claim coins on both chains. When the time comes, it will be up to Alice to trigger the swap. To claim her funds on the BU fork, she has to reveal the secret created at the beginning of the setup. And, with that secret, Bob is able to automatically (and atomically) grab all of his funds on the BTC fork. But, there is a catch. Alice (who, once again, represents Ver) may decide to wait and see what the market is doing first. If the BU chain looks like it's not doing so well, she may renege, and not want go through with the trade after all. And, to guard against that, there is one more transaction to make. To give Alice an added incentive to ""push the button,"" so to speak, a third ""forfeit transaction"" is also set up in advance. By signing the forfeit transaction, Alice grants all the coins to Bob in the event she does not trigger a swap. So, essentially, the question posed at that theoretical point is: ""What will it be, Alice? Do you want the lesser valued coins, or none of the coins?"" If Alice does not sign that transaction in advance, Bob will use the fail-safe set up in the funding transaction to cancel the entire deal, as Alice is not acting in good faith. But once again, all of these transactions need to be setup and signed before the fork. In the event of a BU hard fork, Ver, who has been pushing for bigger blocks for some time now, likely thinks the BU chain would come out on top. But, is he ready to stand by the deal he made with Loaded? If so, McCorry and Heilman say they will be more than happy to set up the transaction. And, they feel confident other developers will pitch in to help out as well. So, with the stage set, all the players ready, what’s next looks like a wait-and-see game for now. ""Loaded asked the community for an atomic trade protocol suitable for the bet, and we have provided him with it,"" said McCorry.

According to Nikkei, Bic Camera, which began accepting bitcoin at several locations in April, is expanding the option after seeing unexpected levels of demand from spenders. The company is taking payments in the digital currency through a partnership with domestic bitcoin exchange bitFlyer, which it uses to convert bitcoin into yen upon acceptance. Bic Camera sells a range of products, including cameras, personal computers and home appliances like dishwashers. News that Bic Camera was taking bitcoin in a limited capacity came shortly after the Japanese government put in place new regulations around digital currencies and the exchange services that handle them. Among those was a legal definition for bitcoin as a kind of payment instrument. Those rules came into being after the failure of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that collapsed in early 2014. Mt Gox's CEO, Mark Karpeles, appeared in court yesterday and pleaded not guilty to embezzlement. As for when the nationwide roll-out is happening, Nikkei reports that it could play out as early as this month. Kojima, a subsidiary brand of Bic Camera's, is also expected to begin accepting bitcoin in the near future.

                            Immature Code or Good Test? Bitcoin Scaling Proposal Segwit2x's Testnet Forks                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-segwit2x-testnet-fork-scaling-proposal/,"Controversial bitcoin scaling proposal Segwit2x's testnet forked yesterday, creating two different and incompatible testnets. Nodes running older bitcoin software continued on as they normally would. But nodes running the new Segwit2x code stalled at block 27070, meaning mining pools running the new software were not mining blocks. Overall, the nodes were stalled for over 20 hours as a result of the issue. While there wasn't any real money on the line, the community was abuzz with the news, some dismissing the controversial scaling proposal for perceived lingering issues, while others defended the misstep as only a small stumbling block that wouldn't happen during a live deployment. Some developers argue the fork is a symptom of a larger trend of Segwit2x developers not listening to other developers who have worked with the bitcoin code for a long time. Bitcoin Core developers, for example, have provided feedback, pointing out perceived errors, but some of that has been ignored. On social media, some argued the testnet fork stemmed from the implementation of the 2MB hard fork developers discussed and disagreed upon a couple of weeks ago. The 2MB hard fork is the second part of the Segwit2x proposal, an effort to double the block size parameter, which will happen three months after the Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation. This second part is important in that if not everyone in the bitcoin ecosystem upgrades to the 2MB increase (and many say they don't plan to), bitcoin could split into two assets. If that split is not made permanent, one chain could ""wipeout"" transactions that occur on the other chain, potentially leading users to lose money. On the project's GitHub, developers had different ideas of how to solve that. Segwit2x went forward with software that requires at least the first block is greater than 1MB. Some contend this is what lead to the testnet fork, since there weren't enough transactions in the mempool, the part of the network where transactions are collected before being selected for blocks. Bitcoin developer James Hilliard had proposed what he calls a ""simpler and better"" way of implementing so-called ""wipeout protection,"" where nodes insert a piece of data making their blocks invalid to the other network. Still, given that it's slated to be deployed in two weeks, for many, the bottom line is that it's too late for the code to have serious issues. Working group members are expected to install and test the code this Friday. Then, mining pools, companies and users are expected to begin running the code on the main bitcoin network as soon as July 21. But Bloq co-founder and BTC1 developer Jeff Garzik argued the fork is not an event to worry about. One of the testnet miners simply triggered an event sooner than planned and without preparation from the working group participants, he said. According to Garzik, this split wouldn't happen once Segwit2x is deployed on the main bitcoin network. He told CoinDesk: BTC.com's Boaz Bechar, who's also working on the Segwit2x implementation, offered a similar explanation. While the testnet isn't expected to have many transactions flowing through it, the main bitcoin network will. ""Although unexpected timing, this is otherwise a good field test,"" Garzik wrote on the Segwit2x working group mailing list. ""This is the whole reason for a test network, after all.""

The new comments shed light on how Global Advisors, a Jersey-based investment firm that buys and sells cryptocurrency, sees changes in the broader crypto markets, which have so far seen a boom in fundraising via custom digital assets in 2017. Recalling this broader increase, the company's director, Daniel Masters, a former energy trader with J.P. Morgan, went so far as to argue that it is the appreciation of alternative cryptocurrencies and ethereum assets that has become the driver of bitcoin's price. ""It was other coins and tokens that were driving value, outperforming bitcoin while dragging the whole complex higher,"" he wrote. Still, Masters believes that, while often dismissed as a ""bubble"" or a ""fad"", ICOs have become the breeding ground for real advances. In particular, he cited the now-ended ICO for Bancor, in which the project aimed at improving smart contracts raised $160m in cryptocurrency. Lauding the mechanics of the sale as ""striking,"" he asserted that Bancor was able to use blockchain technology to offer services that transcend traditional services like Kickstarter. ""Bancor gave a money-back guarantee backed by 80% of the ethereum raised should the market price of [its BNT token] fall below the issue price. Sure enough, a few days later in an overall market sell off, BNT traded to par. Bancor issued a statement saying the buy-back was activated,"" he wrote. Overall, Masters sees this type of ""coded instruction"" as a ""eureka moment"" showcasing what he thinks is evidence of the truly disruptive power of peer-to-peer digital assets.

In the letter, released today, CEO Charles Allen wrote that the firm would invest in initial coin offerings, or ICOs, through which cryptographic tokens tied to a particular blockchain platform or application are sold. It's a funding mechanism that has attracted significant interest among both startups, investors and would-be buyers, though regulatory and ethical concerns have been raised about the model in the past. Allen indicated that BTCS, which is publicly traded as a pink sheet at OTCQB, would invest in blockchain tokens through ICOs as well as direct market purchases and mining. Though the company had previously suspended its mining activities – it reported a robbery last September which resulted in the theft of 165 mining computers – BTCS indicated that it may resume mining through third-party sources. Those plans, the letter goes on to acknowledge, are incumbent on the raising of more money. Allen explained: As previously reported by CoinDesk, BTCS raised $1m early last month in an equity sale. Allen wrote that this sale was undertaken ""to settle liabilities and provide working capital"". That move came as part of a broader restructuring process that played out in the past year. The startup first revealed its digital asset portfolio plans to prospective investors starting in February. That was before the start of what some observers are calling a bubble in cryptocurrency markets. Image via Shutterstock

This suggests that the tax authority – which began pushing for more information in November – may be looking to prioritize data related to more frequent users of the startup's services.

According to Fortune, the agency said it wouldn't seek information related to account security. The filing from last week goes into greater detail, outlining how the IRS will not seek information on users ""who only bought and held bitcoin during the 2013-2015 period"", as well as users for whom the startup filed 1099-K forms in those years. Additionally, ""certain users known to the Internal Revenue Service"" will also be excluded, a list of whom – which wasn't disclosed in the filing"" that will be provided to Coinbase at some future date, according to the filing. Narrower scope aside, the IRS indicated that it could ultimately seek more information on the users in question, writing that it may still ""issue summonses in individual examinations of Coinbase users for the information that it no longer seeks in this proceeding"". The filing is the latest legal twist in the long-running IRS effort to obtain user information from Coinbase. The tax agency's effort has run into headwinds, with pushback coming from both the startup itself as well as some of its users. In March, the IRS asked a federal court to compel Coinbase to turn over the records, and last week's filing resulted from that case. A pair of unnamed Coinbase users filed a motion to intervene in that case in May in an attempt to stop the summons from being executed. The IRS effort, as might be expected, has sparked a broad outcry from both digital currency advocates as well as users of the tech. The agency's strategy has also come under scrutiny from both its government watchdog as well as Congress.

                            Bitcoin + Post-Trade? Nivaura Exits Stealth to Help Banks Use Open Blockchains                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-for-post-trade-nivaura-wants-to-pair-banks-and-public-blockchains/,"Until today, all that was publicly known about Nivaura was its presence in some rather elite blockchain incubators – ranging from JP Morgan's in-residence program to two terms in the UK Financial Conduct Authority’s regulatory sandbox. But it turns out the little-known startup based on Liverpool Street in London, has been doing a lot more than just hobnobbing with bulge bracket banks and building proofs-of-concept. As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Nivaura has formed key partnerships with banks and others in the financial markets space, and has been granted what it described as ""restricted"" permission from the UK regulator to execute the process of issuing financial instruments and administering them after their release. If successful, the series of experiments (which includes its work holding client money and assets) would amount to what the startup calls a ""self-service for capital markets"" that could dramatically compress the complicated vertical processes now in place. But what truly sets apart the work isn't the FCA access or the partnerships with Tier 1 Investment Bank, Metro Bank, Microsoft, Moody’s and more. The real difference here is that while many of Nivaura's competitors insist that a private blockchain is necessary to comply with privacy and transparency regulations, this startup is building its capital markets solutions on the two best-known public blockchains. Nivaura CEO and chief architect Avtar Sehra – a former theoretical physicist – explained to CoinDesk in detail why the FCA permissions were crucial to demonstrating that the bitcoin blockchain and the public ethereum blockchain can accomplish what is widely believed can only be done on a permissioned blockchain. Sehra said: To create its market for issuing and administering securities, ranging from debt and equities to more complicated vehicles, Sehra and his team told CoinDesk they have been granted modified MiFID and CASS approvals from the FCA. But still they had to overcome one key regulatory hurdle: an independent third party is required to reconcile any assets traded or sold. The middleman is legally mandated, or so it would seem. However, Sehra believes that by reimagining the independent third party, or registrar, as a public blockchain, he could save clients up to 15 percent on costs, and for the past year the firm has been testing that theory. In November 2016, Nivaura was one of nine startups added to the FCA's newly created regulatory sandbox, a space where innovative companies can experiment on the fringes of finance without concern that the regulator would come crashing down on them for drawing outside the lines.  The technology itself consists of two main components: First is a platform layer that is essentially a document-tracking system complete with KYC (""know your customer"") functionality that employs Nivaura’s own legal markup language for completing agreements. Second is a ""blockchain agnostic"" connectivity layer that has been tested on both the public ethereum blockchain and the bitcoin blockchain. What's important is that, up until this point, the functionality that compresses the middlemen out of existence isn’t reliant on the distributed ledger at all. Rather, it is a series of ""very simple elements of data,"" as Sehra described them, such as who is the issuer and how many units of an asset are being created? Only at the very end of the carefully constructed work flow is the asset moved on the blockchain. While the smart contract languages associated with ethereum make that process easier from a development perspective, they are not necessary, said Sehra. In the case of bitcoin, the assets exist in bitcoin’s ""OP_Return"" – a field set aside for basic messages that have no impact on the blockchain’s mining process. ""We created a system that can execute the transactions and record them on the OP_Return on bitcoin,"" said Sehra. ""It’s a metadata solution, and the metadata is essentially saying you can create assets on the OP_Return by constructing the transaction, deploying it."" That Nivaura's assets are custodied on the bitcoin and ethereum blockchain instead of a registrar makes the startup a bit like an investment bank. The main difference being that the owners of the assets have their own key to the vault in the form of a private key for each bond, debt issuance, etc. To pull off such a potential paradigm shift, in which capital markets are essentially turned into a high-stakes vending machine, Nivaura has already gathered a host of partners, including multiple banks, which could eventually become their customers, and one registrar that could potentially be disrupted. For the tests in the second sandbox (which begins next month), Sehra breaks down the work – like any good physicist – into a control case and a test case. For the control case, Nivaura operates like a traditional, centralized registrar, and even recruited one of the largest registrars in Europe, Capita Asset Services – which administers £600bn-worth of assets for 6 million investors – to custody the funds. But Capita also helped with the test case, working with Nivaura to create a standard set of documents and agreements that can be executed using the startup’s legal language. Law firm Allen & Overy LLP, at which Nivaura will be the first entrepreneurs in residence beginning in September, helped ensure that the documents execute the work flow in a legally compliant way. To ensure the contracts themselves are populated with reliable data, Nivaura has partnered with Moody’s to provide information about pricing and the likelihood of default based on historical trends. Further, both cloud storage and blockchain services were provided via Microsoft Azure’s blockchain-as-a-service toolkit. Capita's director of asset services, Peter Walker, explained that the compression of so many layers of capital markets service into a single system has the potential to open the investment vehicles to those who otherwise couldn't afford them. In a statement provided to CoinDesk, Walker said: So far, Nivaura’s progress has come largely with the financial support of its founding team, but that is about to change. Last year Goldman Sachs predicted that blockchain could save capital markets $6bn a year, and, last February, a report by financial infrastructure provider Euroclear and law firm Oliver Wyman estimated that the first live implementations would be implemented by as soon as this August. In the race to take the lead in this burgeoning ecosystem, Nivaura board member Alan Morgan of MMC Ventures has led a seed round that just closed for an undisclosed amount, with participation by Digital Currency Group and other individual investors. As the company grows, Sehra says that assets based in bitcoin and ether could end up being only the beginning. He concluded: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Nivaura. Chain-link fence image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's Price Surge is Making Hobby Mining Profitable Again                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-surge-is-making-hobby-mining-profitable-again/,"Roque Solis never imagined the bitcoin mining equipment he bought in February would have already paid for itself. And on top of that, made him money. Solis is the president of SoliSYSTEMS Corp, a company that developed an EMV smart card for electronic benefit transfer for the federal assistance program, Women, Infants, and Children (WIC). While attending several conferences last year, Solis was unable to ignore bitcoin. So, he decided to experiment with the technology via mining to get a better handle on whether the technology could be used within his company. Solis bought a Bitmain Antminer S9 on eBay for $2,400. As of this weekend, Solis has mined 1.01 BTC, worth a little more than $2,584 in his bitcoin wallet. Solis said: These gains, though, are particularly interesting in that, even last year, individual hobby mining wasn't profitable anymore. Individuals with just one or two miners couldn't compete with the companies mining bitcoin using large warehouses full of servers dedicated to the task (and seeing lucrative returns as the price rose). But that was with the price below $600, which, with electricity costs and mining pool fees, would take a person more than 500 days to break even on their bitcoin miner investment. With an increased awareness and usage of mining pools, and the price now far higher, hobby miners – as Solis' experience shows – can break even in several months. According to Solis, the amount of money he’s making per day with the miner jumped from $7 to $16 recently, as the price shot up. And to bitcoin's enthusiasts this is evidence that the increase really does benefit the network more broadly. According to Sean Walsh, a partner at Redwood City Ventures, a bitcoin and blockchain consulting and investment firm, the rising bitcoin price has done more than reinvigorate investors, it's also led to increased interest in bitcoin mining, a key process that supports the network by securing its ledger. Walsh told CoinDesk: And the Google Trends for ""bitcoin"" and ""bitcoin mining"" tell a similar story. Many of the peaks in the chart for both terms coincide with spikes in price. Yet, it's not only the price per bitcoin that's luring in new bitcoin mining hobbyists. According to Walsh, while bitcoin transaction fees were relatively stable for a long time, in the past couple years, those fees have seen an uptick. ""This has to do with the block size debate, because the network is a bit congested, and people are having to pay more to get their transactions confirmed,"" he said. Whereas only a few years ago, around 100 bitcoins per day was paid in transaction fees, in the past couple months, transaction fees have equaled around 350 bitcoins a day, Walsh said, pointing to stats on bitcoin data website Blockchain.info. And with 1,800 bitcoins produced daily, 350 bitcoins is close to 20% of that. This is in stark contrast to a year ago when only 60 bitcoins were paid in transaction fees and 3,600 bitcoins were being produced daily (before the halving), making the percentage paid in fees around 1.6%. ""That's a huge boost,"" Walsh said. He continued: But those who have been in the cryptocurrency space for a while know this story, and would likely caution against Solis and others thinking that the upward momentum will continue. Warning of future corrections, Walsh said: For example, if new miners overspend on hosting servers, when there's a correction, they're over-leveraged. And that's a cardinal sin in any investment, said Walsh. Bitcoin was down about 20% over the last couple weeks of June. Walsh called the downswings just ""normal respiration of an asset class,"" yet others not so versed in investing might be unaware of these fluctuations and get themselves in trouble. For Solis, though, it's all about learning through experience. The Antminer S9 is running in SoliSYSTEM’s server room in the company’s office in Allen, Texas. Solis isn't able to identify just how much electricity the miner is using, though, since there’s clusters of servers there already. ""It is noisy, though,"" Solis said. ""Compared to the other servers, it’s very noisy."" And that's because it's a machine with two specialized ASIC boards, crunching numbers with a fan that rotates at 5,400–7,000 revolutions per minute, he said. Solis isn't only interested in bitcoin. Having been introduced to ethereum's ether token and the network's smart contract architecture, he had one of his employees buy some immediately via an online exchange several weeks ago. And he plans to start mining ether soon. He's also researching Hyperledger and other private blockchain systems. All this, so he can better envision the use cases for his company. According to Solis, the company is looking into how blockchain could underpin a mobile, closed-loop electronic benefits transfer system. Miner image courtesy of Roque Solis

                            Smart Contracts for Bitcoin? Lightning's Tadge Dryja Is Working on It                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/smart-contracts-bitcoin-lightnings-tadge-dryja-working/,"In the race to build public blockchains empowered with self-executing code, at least two competing philosophies have emerged. Ethereum has created a platform that makes it easy for developers to create nearly any type of smart contract that they want, while bitcoin has been added similar functionality at a much slower pace. But bitcoin developers like Lightning Network paper co-author Tadge Dryja argue there's a reason for adding smart contract functionality to bitcoin more cautiously. During his work on the transaction-boosting technology Lightning Network, which he has been working on more recently at MIT, he came up with a method of adding some smart contract functionality to bitcoin in a way that he believes could preserve both privacy and scalability. The idea behind Dryja's Discreet Log Contracts (DLC) is to try to keep the blockchain more decentralized. Dryja told CoinDesk: While onlookers often see the two cryptocurrencies as competitors, Dryja went on to argue that his idea may just be more practical as an engineering option in the long term. ""It has much lower impact on everyone else who uses the system, as the contracts take up very little [space] on the blockchain,"" he said. Dryja's smart contract idea centers around a popular concept: oracles. Some of the more complex and interesting smart contracts, as proposed, need the help of an outside data source. Oracles feed that data to smart contracts, which then execute based on the data that they receive. Say that one user bets five ether that on Friday we will see over 80ºF weather. Two users set up a smart contract that specifies these conditions, and then select a data source that they both trust. (Maybe both users decide that theweather.com is the most trusted resource for timely temperature data.) Next, the smart contract receives information from this source automatically on Friday. Whoever guesses the correct temperature range wins the five ether. Simple, right? Ideas for how to do this in bitcoin already exist, but aren't widely used. Dryja thinks that could be for a few reasons. One, these oracles need to be aware of users through the whole process, opening opportunities for the two to collude and game the system. Two, oracles will know which users are requesting data from them, which means that users that leverage the construction risk their privacy. That's where Dryja's idea comes in. The interesting part is that the oracle operator can't see if anyone is using the data it sends out. ""That's the lonely life of an oracle,"" he said. ""You can't even tell if there was even a contract even after it happens. So that's kind of fun."" How does DLC accomplish that? At a high level, the oracle beams out data. (Say it sends out the temperature at a certain time each day.) This key will be mixed with data from the user before it is added to the blockchain. Since the oracle's key is mixed with data that the oracle doesn't know about, the oracle can't tell if it was ever used and added to the bitcoin blockchain. ""We're going to combine the oracle's data with our own secret data, so we can recognize it but the oracle won’t recognize it,"" Dryja said. He argued that the rationale for this level of privacy is that, more likely than not, companies using blockchain technologies don't want to reveal their financial records or a trail of the data they're using to the rest of the world. DLC, like the ethereum project Town Crier, proposes one way of shielding some of the data. Besides privacy, oracles face some other tricky problems. In general, oracles are trusted centralized services. Why does that matter? Remember, the smart contract is going to execute whether it's fed correct data or not. So, users need to ""trust"" that the service is sending reliable data. Developers have proposed different ways of dealing with this point of centralization. Decentralized prediction market Augur, for example, plans to use a number of oracles at once to report an outcome. Dryja doesn't think there's a way of eradicating the problem completely, though he has a couple of ideas for at least ""mitigating"" it. DLC aims to incentivize oracles to report the correct information. If an oracle dishonestly broadcasts different information to two smart contracts, for example, then the oracle's private key will automatically be revealed. ""Mathematically it works, but does it actually stop oracles from misreporting?"" he said, adding that it will take more review to find out how well the idea stands up. The idea is still a work in progress, but Dryja said that he's looking for more feedback from the community with the publication of a white paper on DLC. For now, he hopes that his idea will help to inspire a new way of thinking about smart contracts; one that is more privacy and scalability focused. As far as next steps for the project, Dryja said that DLC will be his ""next fun project"" after he squares away some of the work he's doing on his version of the Lightning Network for MIT. He noted that DLC does not require any changes to bitcoin, but it (like many others in the space) will work better when a coding optimization known as SegWit is activated on bitcoin – if it ever is. He further said that it's possible to code up a version of DLC without SegWit, but it would be ""annoying"" to complete a version of the code that doesn't require SegWit's activation if SegWit is then activated soon after. So, he will likely wait for its activation to begin work on the project. Tadge Dryja image via Shutterstock

                            Who Watches Bitcoin's Watchmen? Scaling's Great Game of Egos                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/watches-bitcoins-watchmen-scalings-great-game-egos/,"Pete Rizzo is the editor for CoinDesk, where he oversees content production for CoinDesk.com and CoinDesk research products. He previously served as editor for PYMNTS.com. In this opinion piece, Rizzo discusses developments in bitcoin's scaling debate, adding color to the cast of characters involved in the hopes of highlighting essential parts of the disagreement at play. ""Thermodynamic miracles... events with odds against so astronomical they're effectively impossible, like oxygen spontaneously becoming gold. I long to observe such a thing.""
– Dr Manhattan, ""Watchmen"" While much has been said about bitcoin, this discussion is not without its inherent problems. One of the least addressed is the extent to which language itself has done disservice and damage to the development of what can only be considered a human technical achievement still struggling to be understood. Indeed, a great irony that has emerged with ""bitcoin"" is that a distributed system with so many intricate components can even be referred to in singularity at all. It shouldn't be a surprise then that the idea that bitcoin can or should change the delicate balance of its protocol rules has been the biggest victim of limited vocabulary. Should bitcoin become a 'digital currency' or 'digital gold'? Should this choice be dictated by scientific analysis, or guided by strict interpretation of vision? Any choice of words creates biases that, owing to the system's distributed nature, are incapable of being broadly enforced. Bitcoin as an idea is now owned by many real people, all with different backgrounds, who understand the technology in different ways, who have different wants owing to their specific positions related to the protocol and who have profited differently from these associations. What's clear now, however, is that at least three principal groups are capable of exercising power over that system – miners, entrepreneurs and developers – all of whom have different understandings of what ""bitcoin"" is and how they believe ""bitcoin"" should be. (Users, the fourth principal group, now seem caught on the sidelines in what can only be described as a power struggle that, at this point, has become entirely a game of human egos.) Fueling the flames of the debate is a specific proposal stands to impact the balance of power between these parties, altering its ideological and sociological balance through technology. Organized by investor Digital Currency Group and backed by miners and entrepreneurs, Segwit2x intends to enact Segregated Witness, a network optimization originally proposed by developers, before increasing bitcoin's hard-coded block size three months later. As a political creation, it is a compromise of long-discussed compromises. But, while the code is a collection of pre-existing ideas, its enactment stands to be quite radical, impacting the system in a way that could, at the very least, reshape bitcoin's power structure, and at most, cause bitcoin to splinter into two. But if it's true that language has impaired development and understanding of bitcoin, so too has it failed to properly categorize how stakeholders see themselves as players on a grand stage, writing a narrative with the ability, they believe, to impart lasting change on the world. The following attempts to use – broad generalizations – to relay my experiences and interactions with the various constituents in the hope of explaining their positions and views on the scaling debate in aggregate, and how they relate to repercussions of the Segwit2x proposal. ""We can do so much more. We can save this world... with the right leadership."" – Ozymandias Perhaps the easiest group to understand are the entrepreneurs. On the whole, they are young, Western, and libertarian. They are doers that prefer action, and (generally) believe in compromise over ideals. Ambitious founders, natural and charismatic leaders, they are public faces. They have been the subject of magazine articles, they have thousands of social media followers. They have spent years traveling around the globe extolling the virtues of a ""payment system"" that was truly different. That was limited today, yes, but ""capable of change"". To them, the prolonged scaling debate has shaken an unspoken core belief, that everything in bitcoin was subject to revision, able to be made better by the other doers and thinkers that would doubtless follow their example. ""Bitcoin is open source. Ten-minute confirmation times can be changed,"" 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan, then the stealth startup's chairman, declared in 2015. It is likely that this argument was put forward in board rooms. To important people. Celebrities. Influencers. It was both true, and capable of not being true, though this latter complication was perhaps too easily discarded. I don't suppose it would be a stretch to assume that many bitcoin entrepreneurs have had a limited understanding of bitcoin as a technology not in theory, but in practice. While their notions are correct, they have also existed without being challenged by the complex human system of developers and miners that would enact it. Many seem to have considered the protocol an afterthought, assuming problems would be worked out in their favor and in the advancement of a definition of bitcoin as an open-source payment system that would create new business opportunities. That a new philosophy would emerge that would argue that blockchains are protocols that would be unlikely to sustain a significant class of startups, wasn't foreseen, and doesn't seem to be something that is broadly acknowledged. It's perhaps this last part that has the biggest impact on their relationship with developers, as extracting value from a system often necessities an intermediary role, one that developers now argue, from a scientific standpoint, might have meant to be eliminated. ""Not even in the face of Armageddon. Never compromise."" – Rorschach. What then of the developers? The open-source group often referred to as Bitcoin Core. They prize idealism and patience. It was once told to me that new developers are trained in hours-long question-and-answer sessions that run through the night. The knowledge must pass down, drip by drip, to those who could expand their mind and attain it. They are also elusive, stubborn in their views and guided by paranoia (though the latter is as much of a strength as a weakness). Not a small number use pseudonyms owing to the belief that bitcoin has successfully culled back human rights from what they perceive as the violence of centralized governments. Early to the software, they turned to bitcoin as an alternative to traditional money, an idea that could reshape society if steadily shepherded. I once asked two high-profile developers if they cared if they even lived to see bitcoin become what they envisioned. They seemed to think that this was unlikely, and didn't seem worse off for the realization. To developers, the lack of ""progress"" on scaling is evidence bitcoin is withstanding human collusion. Any advancement that comes at the sake of practicality or a ""greater good"" is a perversion of the system, akin to using a dictator to save democracy. It's perhaps not an understatement that their relationship with miners is challenging for similar reasons. To most bitcoin developers, miners have been chiefly an intellectual consideration. That is to say, they are considered insofar as they are necessary to the system as vital, but ultimately replaceable parts, of that system. They believe that bitcoin derives security from computing power, but don't particularly care who provides it. Should one group seek to impose their will on the system, the laws of economics, they seem to think, will eventually bring along a more accommodating crowd. As for the startups, there seems to be a lingering resentment between these camps – some have even gone so far as to label the prioritization of the needs of startups as an ""attack"" on the system itself. ""I am tired of Earth. These people. I am tired of being caught in the tangle of their lives."" – Dr Manhattan It's often understated just how amazing it is that bitcoin mining evolved the way it did, mutating quickly from a computer-based competition between individual users to an industry that supports three-to-four distinct and highly specialized business models. If bitcoin miners have become barons with outsize influence on the network, even influence that was never intended, they sit on a throne of skulls. Miners outcompeted the world, produced chips faster at scale, filled data centers faster at scale and generally competed better in an industry so difficult that it is in a constant state of reinvention. But miners are people. They are predominantly young, of Chinese descent and extraordinarily wealthy owing to the success of their businesses. Most have approached the scaling debate with all the enthusiasm of tag-alongs to a party who were suddenly asked to dictate the music. They were thrust into a situation they didn't quite understand (or understood very differently), one that has been exacerbated by cultural differences in governance and business etiquette. The constant in-fighting and intellectual combat aren't things that they signed up for, or that they seem very interested in participating in. The common mood among them of late seems exasperation. As for developers, it might be an understatement to say this is strained (some have gone so far as to call for the Core developers to be fired outright). Whatever goodwill that once existed has now mostly eroded through public displays of animosity, and the fact that for miners, there are plenty of other ways to make money through a diversified ecosystem of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets. ""Battle not with monsters, lest ye become a monster."" Left alone, arguments would likely persist without action. However, the situation is now being shaped by the perception of external threat. Since the beginning of 2017, $90bn has been allocated to alternative cryptocurrencies, all but obliterating the narrative that bitcoin as a specific iteration of cryptocurrency could serve as the ""internet of money"". Once defended by its early lead and network effect, venture capital interest has now largely migrated to ethereum, which they believe is better facilitating this shift. In the court of public opinion, investors have already eaten their words. For bitcoin, this now poses a moral paradox with two visions at play. Developers seem to be arguing that the power of bitcoin lies in the ability of each and every user to validate the network's entire transaction history, and that no sacrifices should be made toward this end. Not doing so, they reason, is a return to the system of banking today, in which intermediaries are trusted with this role and users are powerless. It is not enough that a system would be faster or more convenient, and perhaps, more decentralized. It is not enough to sacrifice today what could be achieved, however theoretically, tomorrow. The process, they reason, must be slow, as this is the nature of scientific advancement. Entrepreneurs, however, hear the ticking of the doomsday clock (personified by their runways and business outlooks). The great cryptocurrency bubble, for them, is a necessary monster. Should it not exist, another would be created as a means of benefitting the ""greater good"" (as gauged by the health and success of their businesses in promoting bitcoin). Miners have already made their choice which of the two visions of the network with which to align. What's guiding this choice is less clear, though most, when pressured seem to suggest that they believe it will increase the value of bitcoin. How a 2MB block size increase can compete with 1,000x ICO gains, or why an increasingly diversified cryptocurrency ecosystem does anything but strengthen bitcoin's value proposition, don't seem to be questions any are interested in answering. ""In the end? Nothing ends, Adrian. Nothing ever ends."" – Dr Manhattan So, what to make now of this modern missile crisis? Bitcoin scaling has so far been a game played across many continents. It is a muse for which thousands of hours have been spent in the composition of think pieces, proposals, arguments and all manner of human creations. It has led the technology's best minds to plead and stomp and grind their fingernails into their palms, to vow to never come back to bitcoin again. But, they have always returned with new ideas, new enthusiasm and the promise of something better. What happens then if they go their separate ways? The union of startups and miners would appear to be tenuous. What will happen when larger blocks push down opportunities for miners to collect fees? Or when the new developers can't match the track record of Bitcoin Core? A marriage of convenience doesn't necessarily make a lasting one. Should developers end up on their own blockchain, who will offer essential infrastructure to ensure the technology is broadly used? True to the idealism or not, many bitcoin users are customers of startups. Much of the narrative the public has consumed is influenced and informed by their success. Doubtless hard feelings have been inflamed by both sides. But more than anything, it would seem any split or change in power would undermine the very thing bitcoin sought to provide to the economically disenfranchised – security. In an increasingly diverse crypto asset ecosystem, more and more devoid of rationality, it's hard to see the value in sacrificing what can only be achieved through continued unity.

                            Former Bain Manager Launches $50 Million Bitcoin and Ethereum Fund                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/former-bain-manager-launches-50-million-bitcoin-ethereum-fund/,"Some of the wealthiest families in Latin America now have access to a new way to invest, thanks in part to a former senior manager at consulting firm Bain & Company. Announced today, the newly formed Crypto Assets Fund, co-founded by former senior manager at Bain, Roberto Ponce Romay, is helping to raise $50m with the purpose of buying cryptocurrencies for family offices. Revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, Crypto Assets Fund (CAF) will invest directly in bitcoin, ether, zcash, ripple, litecoin and dash. The first tranche of the fund, estimated to be valued about $10m, is in the final stages of closing, and is expected to be announced by the end of this month. In interview, Romay explained that the purpose of the fund was two-fold. First, it was designed to give investors in some of Latin America’s more unstable economies a new way to hedge their investments, and second, it was meant to provide the opportunity to safely learn about these new stores of value for possible future investments. According to Romay, as the fund's investors are becoming increasingly familiar with the crypto-asset class, the CAF could eventually raise new funds that also include tokens sold as part of initial coin offerings, or ICOs. ""This fund is investor driven,"" said Romay, who is now the director of investment banking boutique, Invermaster. ""It is a simple strategy to give access."" He added:  Investment documents provided to CoinDesk further reveal details about how the British Virgin Islands fund intends to invest capital provided by its limited partners. Fund co-founders, including the vice president of bitcoin payments startup Ripio, David Garcia, and, ARG Capital partner Miguel Iribarne, are raising the cash from accredited family office investors in Argentina, Costa Rica and other Latin American nations. The service is designed to give new crypto-asset investors exposure to bitcoin and ether without taking on the added risk of regulatory and tax compliance and storage. No fee is being charged for the service, but 30% of the carried interest will be collected by the fund based on certain conditions. At the time of launch, the funds are expected to be held by Switzerland-based Xapo, with over-the-counter trading services provided by B2C2 OTC, an electronic market maker and a UK FCA appointed representative. The fund expects to provide broker funding via Silvergate Bank, according to its investor documents, though after this article was published the bank informed CoinDesk it does not currently count the Fund as a client. While investors who put up a minimum of $2.5m will be allowed to hold their funds for the maximum period of five years, most investors will gain access to their 180 days after the next bitcoin halving in 2020, when the reward to mine bitcoin will automatically be reduced. Half of all initial funds raised will be invested in bitcoin, with the other half divided between the remaining cryptocurrencies. But future funds could include new assets and other investors. ""We are mainly targeting family offices in Latin America,"" said Garcia. ""But there are other players interested in the fund, because the fund strategy also fits with what they’re looking for."" While bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were originally heralded as new ways for the unbanked populations of developing countries to participate in the global economy, that has been changing in recent years. As early use cases including remittances were targeted largely at workers looking to send money home, this latest development shows how services are now being aimed at the wealthy. CoinDesk first reported on this push by family offices into the cryptocurrency space last March. Now, based on previous growth trajectories of CAF’s crypto-assets, the fund lists a minimum target return of 26% per year for three years with an ""expected"" target return of 71%. But Garcia said Latin American family investors are looking for more than just a new way to make money. Depending on the nation, they are also looking for a way to hedge against less stable fiat currencies. He explained: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripple, Xapo and ZECC (developer of zcash).  Editor's note: This article was updated to clarify that B2C2 OTC is a UK FCA appointed representative.

In the note, Jafari posits that bitcoin markets are in the fourth ""wave"" of a sequence that dates back to late 2010. As for what comes next, Jafari acknowledges that fourth waves ""tend to be messy/complex"".  Jafari goes on to write: “Either way, eventually expecting one more leg higher; a 5th wave.

A report from regional news service Yonhap on Monday indicated that as many as 30,000 customers of Bithumb were impacted. The source of the data leak is believed to have been an employee's computer, leading to the draining of funds from an unknown number of user accounts. According to data from CoinMarketCap, Bithumb is currently the fourth-largest bitcoin exchange by volume, accounting for roughly 3% of the global market. The exchange is the largest ethereum exchange as of today, reporting about 13.5% of total trade activity. Though the exact scale of losses isn't known at press time, Bithumb said in a blog post published earlier today that it is providing 100,000 Korean won – worth about $86.50 at press time – to each affected customer. Local reports further indicate that the incident dates back to February, and was first reported to authorities late last month. One local user claimed to have 10 million won, worth roughly $8,700, taken from their account. The exchange said that it will further compensate users whose funds are stolen as a result of the data leak. ""In addition, for the members who suffer additional damage due to this incident, we will compensate the entire amount of damages in a responsible manner,"" Bithumb's operators said. The incident has been reported to local authorities, according to Yonhap, resulting in the early stages of an investigation by the Korea Internet and Security Agency.

In this opinion piece, Lukasiewicz reflects on the beginnings of US regulatory oversight, arguing choices made in the technology's infancy have had a lasting negative impact on industry startups. Reflecting on this piece, I feel like part of an older generation of bitcoin – even though when I entered the space in 2012, my impression was that I was late to the game. Many crypto enthusiasts had already been active in it for years, mining away, and I still had much to learn about the blockchain. It's interesting to look back now, since in 2012, I was entering an industry that was completely unregulated and still in its ""Wild West"" infancy. Most bitcoin exchanges were sketchy, and I set out to build a reliable US-based exchange called Coinsetter (since acquired by Kraken, which I highly recommend). In that process, I witnessed the emergence of a new regulation that would impact the entire industry… *** 18th March, 2013, was the day that the US federal government came out with regulatory guidance that marked most bitcoin companies as money service businesses. Being the optimist that I am, I viewed this announcement as a positive development – an opportunity to legitimize our company and the broader bitcoin industry. In hindsight, the policy would become the slow ""nail in the coffin"" that would prevent bitcoin from disrupting consumer payments at mass. With 50+ new regulators to report to, compliance became a concern for most companies. Know-your-customer (KYC) rules were just the beginning of compliance, and frankly, the easy part. Regulation became much more challenging in the areas of licensing (impossible to obtain), transaction monitoring (impossible to comply with the status quo requirements), banking relationships (impossible to maintain), reporting and capital requirements. In March 2013, most of the industry's leaders had little understanding of these topics. After bitcoin companies hired lawyers, consultants, dedicated countless hours to completing paperwork and spent tons of money, most regulators did the following: *** My experience with the ""BitLicense"" was a direct example of this behavior. New York introduced a ""framework"" for bitcoin companies to apply for regulatory licensing and thus obtain a path towards operating with legal clarity. The BitLicense formation process took years and was ultimately a way for the state regulator, Ben Lawsky, to attract positive press for himself. He left shortly after BitLicense applications were due and didn't stay to approve any of them. Only a few companies ever received licenses, and most applications are still in limbo years later. It's frankly stressful running a bitcoin or blockchain company in the US. For our team at Coinsetter, even when we reached out proactively, most regulators politely denied us a path toward full compliance. Living in an undefined regulatory environment, we always had the dangling fear that we could be penalized at any regulator’s sole discretion. You didn't have to be doing anything wrong to feel that way, either. *** Has the regulatory situation improved? In some areas, yes. But the banking issues Bitfinex and other exchanges experienced recently are a lingering, direct consequence of these policy decisions made four years ago. Today, the challenges bitcoin companies previously faced are hitting blockchain projects. It's unfortunate, since these organizations are building the modernized infrastructure that will create a more secure digital future for everyone in the world. I believe they'll succeed, but anyone starting these companies will have to deal with similar regulatory uncertainties like bitcoin faced a few years ago. I hope companies will take a strong public stance against stifling regulation as it comes up. For those in the US, it is important to remind regulators that technology companies are going overseas because of the current regulatory environment. Billions will be invested in blockchain startups – will the US choose to benefit from it? But to me, 18th March was the start of it all. It drastically changed how bitcoin and blockchain companies would need to operate going forward within a regulator-influenced paradigm. The industry hasn't been the same since.

                            A Cypherpunk Dream: Blockstream Developer Departs to Build Bitcoin Web                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/cypherpunk-dream-blockstream-developer-departs-build-bitcoin-web/,"""Combined with emerging information markets, cryptoanarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures."" — Timothy C. May, ""The Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"" *** Bitcoin developer Eric Martindale has departed what might might be considered one of the sweetest gigs in the industry to follow his dream of building a decentralized information market where any data can be traded without restriction. Having left the heavily funded magnet for bitcoin developer talent, Blockstream, earlier this year, the self-identified ""cypherpunk"" last week kicked off a roadshow to tour his idea for a new way to build applications directly on the bitcoin blockchain, and to raise funds from investors. In one sense, Martindale’s project, called Fabric, is a decentralized, trustless exchange similar to an increasing number of marketplaces already in the works. What distinguishes the effort, though, is smart contract functionality he believes is superior to ethereum. Martindale told CoinDesk: Perhaps best known for his work helping build BitPay's open-source developer kit, Bitcore, Martindale was hired with much fanfare a year ago to serve as Blockstream's ""technology evangelist"" helping build out the firm's open-source strategy. But as revealed to CoinDesk, Martindale had already been hard at work on Fabric at the time of his hire, going so far as to sign an early version of the white paper into the bitcoin blockchain. In addition to being a distributed marketplace for information, Martindale described Fabric as the building blocks for a ""much larger system of things and how they interact with each other in the real world."" The Internet of Things-ready platform powered by the bitcoin blockchain is being built with what Martindale describes as an ""offline first"" philosophy. He says that applications built on a decentralized version of the internet should be able to fully function without an internet connection, then automatically sync up with the blockchain only when desired. To enable the system of smart contract-powered applications, Martindale said Fabric reduces developer behavior to ""verifiable"" actions that can then be coded into a smart contract. ""Fabric is an app layer for bitcoin. And it is a protocol for those apps to interact with each other without having to trust each other,"" said Martindale. ""It’s a protocol for the exchange and manipulation of agreements and contracts and the exchange of data within those contracts."" When Martindale left BitPay last year, he said he had already been working on Fabric for about three years, and had been considering giving the idea ""a serious go"" back then, before concluding the technology wasn’t yet ready. So far, the bootstrapped project has been largely a solo effort, though he says he ""bounced ideas off"" Blockstream's co-founder, Peter Wiulle, and its CTO, Greg Maxwell. A representative of Blockstream has confirmed that the company encourages its employees to work on open-source projects and wished Martindale ""all the best."" Since initially starting work on Fabric, Martindale said he’s been keeping the work ""close to his chest"" and focusing on what he believes are key improvements to the proof-of-work algorithm. Then, three months ago, he had what he called a ""breakthrough"" in the work. Though he declined to go into much detail about its nature, he compared his idea to MIT’s Enigma project for off-chain transactions with additional features designed to allow for an infinite series of sidechains. Martindale called this technology ""state bubbles"", explaining that they will simplify the enforcement of complicated agreements. ""We're using proof-of-work to perform valuable calculations in a cryptographically secure way by distributing across the network,"" he said. Martindale’s vision for a decentralized marketplace for information is not new. The idea lies at the core of the cyberpunk movement as explained in Timothy C Mays' 1988 ""Crypto Anarchist Manifesto"". The idea of an information exchange was then popularized in the 1980s by economist Phil Salin, who founded the American Information Exchange, later acquired by Autodesk. Since the advent of blockchain technology, the best known information exchange is the Silk Road, which, before it was shuttered by the FBI in 2014, offered for sale banned books and illicit or illegal services in addition to drugs. Most recently, the idea has taken form in the likes of OpenBazaar (developed by OB1), a decentralized market place. Bitcoin marketplace Purse.io even went so far as to offer its own full node bitcoin implementation, bcoin, to enable the creation of a wide variety of applications. But fully functioning stacks for a decentralized internet are still in the earliest stages of development, with venture-backed RSK and Blockstack having just recently released versions of their own attempts to push the technology forward. To help bridge the gap between Fabric and the creation of fully functioning, smart-contract enabled applications built on the bitcoin blockchain, Martindale also revealed details about Maki: a compiler for Fabric that is already being tested by early adopters working to build websites and mobile applications using the technology. Now that Martindale has completed the first leg of an international road trip in search of investors and members of what he hopes will be his founding team, he is preparing to publish an updated version of the white paper he signed to the bitcoin blockchain two years ago, including details of what he believes are improvements to proof-of-work. ""Fundamentally, it is an information market in the truest cypherpunk sense,"" said Martindale: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack, Blockstream, OB1, Purse and RSK.  Complex machine image via Shutterstock

According to court documents filed today, the SEC accused Renwick Haddow of misleading stakeholders who bought into two companies he founded: Bitcoin Shop Inc., which was advertised as a platform for trading bitcoin, and Bar Works, a co-working space company akin to WeWork. Concurrently, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York is also pressing charges against Haddow. The SEC alleged that Haddow, who resides in New York, misrepresented key factors about the company's operation and the background of senior executives of Bitcoin Store Inc. who, according to the statement, ""do not appear to exist"" in an attempt to to allure potential investors. Haddow – who the SEC said created a broker-dealer firm, called InCrowd Equity, without registering with the agency – was further accused of diverting funds raised from investors to bank accounts held outside of the country. The SEC said today in a release: In court documents, the SEC noted that Haddow had previously received an eight-year disqualification in the UK from working as the director of a company, a ban stemming from his involvement with a firm called Branded Leisure plc. The SEC also alleged that fake identities were employed by the accused firms. The court documents noted that the CEO of the startup is named Gordon Phillips, who appeared in promotional videos for the service. According to a LinkedIn page, the profiled person used to work for HSBC in London and Hong Kong, as well as Deutsche Bank. Yet the agency alleged that Gordon Phillips ""never worked for HSBC or Deutsche Bank"" and it believes the name is a fictitious one. Earlier this month, New York business publication Crain's reported on the collapse of Bar Works, noting that the firm is the subject of an investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as well as two investor-led lawsuits. A report in January, from The Real Deal, first suggested that fake identities were employed. The website www.bitcoinstore.global appears to be connected to the scheme. A press release published on the site in July 2015 showed that Bitcoin Store Inc., the exact name of the entity charged by the SEC, was trying to issue a convertible promissory notes with a coupon of 8% per annum in order to raise $1.825 million.

Thomas Costanzo, who runs a bitcoin services website that offers sales for bitcoin mining equipment and ATMs, was arrested in late April and initially charged with the unlawful possession of a firearm, which resulted from a previous conviction. A new superseding indictment, unsealed this week, reveals that the government is pressing charges against Costanzo related to his digital currency activities. Costanzo was accused of exchanged $166,000 with undercover agents between May 2015 and April 2017, funds that were ""represented by a law enforcement officer to be proceeds of specified unlawful activity"", according to the indictment. Court documents show that another individual, Peter Steinmetz, is also being charged. Costanzo and Steinmetz were each charged for running an illegal money transmission business. Costanzo was additionally charged with money laundering and felony possession of a firearm. In April, local and federal law enforcement officials raided Costanzo's residence and later had him held following an initial hearing. Police records published at the time showed that officials included bitcoin and digital currency-related items in their warrant, suggesting at the time that they might press for charges beyond the gun-related one. The court case is the latest in the US to involve a bitcoin trader or seller who is charged with unlawful money transmission. In some of those instances, undercover investigators would purchase bitcoins from those targeted in the sting operations. Justice statue image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Scaling Project Segwit2x to Release New Code Today                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-scaling-project-segwit2x-release-new-code-tomorrow/,"Segwit2x, a controversial scaling proposal largely backed by the bitcoin network's enterprises and miners, is moving ahead in adherence with its previously announced timeline. In an email yesterday, Bloq co-founder and Segwit2x lead developer Jeff Garzik confirmed to CoinDesk that new code is set to be released on Friday, following two weeks of alpha release testing. The release is said to address issues and comments on the initial version. As such, the release is expected to mark a new phase for the proposal, which has been praised by some as a pragmatic solution to the network's perceived capacity issues and derided by others as a deal that misunderstands the nature of bitcoin development and the network's intended design. Still, it has emerged as unique, given that it was able to bring together perhaps the largest contingent of companies and mining pools ever in support of a scaling proposal. Further, its support by a large majority of miners means, if released, the code could quickly gain the necessary backing from the network to activate the upgrade. If development continues as planned, bitcoin’s long-requested scaling optimization SegWit could be activated before August, with a hard fork to double the block size slated for three months later. This change, though, also remains a matter of controversy and critique. So far, little is publicly known about the testing process. According to those involved, the last two weeks of development have been dedicated to testing, with the firms involved using a new testnet (""testnet5"") and a so-called faucet that spits out fake coins to test the system. A notable change this week was that the team tweaked the details of the hard fork portion of the agreement for the time being Companies involved in the project – including Abra, Bitfury, Blockchain, BTCC, OpenBazaar, Purse and Xapo – have been contributing to development and testing, though it’s still not public who's working on what. From the SegWit2x GitHub site, it is apparent that developers have been testing the code. Purse CTO Christopher Jeffrey, for instance, identified and fixed some bugs during this two-week stage, while others flagged and put forth other ideas. Some companies are playing a smaller role in the effort. For example, OpenBazaar's lead backend developer, Chris Pacia, said that he is the sole developer from the firm to contribute to the project. He explained that he created a testnet5 DNS seed (which helps new nodes connect to the test network) and has offered occasional feedback. However, a few of the firms that pledged to assist in testing the code have been hesitant to reply to requests about their involvement. (Some critics have gone as far as to argue that the firms involved are ""corporatizing"" bitcoin, asserting that Segwit2x is a small group of companies in an invite-only Slack channel attempting to govern a decentralized online currency.) So, with the beta release almost here, what's next? According to the schedule, mining pools are supposed to install the software on 14th July, which they can use to signal support for the upgrade after 21st July. Last week mining pools representing 80% of the bitcoin hashrate agreed to run the code that could lock in SegWit before 31st July. After that, three months later, is the planned hard fork to boost the block size. Of concern, is that the fork could potentially result in a split into two competing tradeable bitcoin assets if not everyone agrees to upgrade their software to the change. While this is the plan for later in the summer, bitcoin developer James Hilliard mentioned that the details of the 2MB hard fork portion are still up for debate. ""It’s unclear what the details are,"" he told CoinDesk. Hilliard, who's contributed code to Segwit2x that might help to avoid a split into two assets, is skeptical of the hard fork timeline, calling it ""unrealistic"" – a sentiment shared by other Bitcoin Core contributors, who nearly universally reject the SegWit2x project. Developers have proposed various ways of doing the hard fork portion of the code, though Hilliard said it would be possible to wait and finish the code and logistics for increasing the block size parameter after SegWit activates. As usual, users will have to wait and see how this will unfold, and for now, speculate on the possible outcomes and their impact.

No details were provided as to the nature of the accounts that were compromised, and whether they were software wallets (in which the users controlled their funds) or hosted wallet services (where the bitcoins in question were maintained by a company).

                            Bitcoin Legal Experts: nChain SegWit Criticisms Are Flawed                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-legal-experts-nchain-segwit-criticisms-flawed/,"An effort by stealth bitcoin startup nChain to raise awareness of supposed issues with code that would boost the capacity of the distributed payments network is coming under fire. Following its publication yesterday, legal experts raised concerns about a view put forward in a CoinDesk opinion article by nChain legal officer Jimmy Nguyen that asserted the upgrade, called Segregated Witness, could face problems under US electronic signature law if activated on the network. Nguyen's criticisms fly in the face of what has emerged as broad support for the network optimization, which has been largely embraced by the network's developers, miners and startups as a pragmatic step forward, though the specifics on how it should be enacted vary. Analysts went so far as to question the motives of the commentary, suggesting that they showed a lack of understanding about how the bitcoin protocol functions today, as well as the functionality it is intended to provide. Chief among the critics were lawyers versed on the intricacies of blockchain law in the US. Marco Santori, a fintech lawyer who leads the blockchain tech team at Cooley LLP, for example, took issue with what he argued was the confused framing of the allegation. Santori told CoinDesk: Stephen Palley, counsel at Washington, DC, law firm Anderson Kill, remarked similarly that the argument perhaps put too much weight on the idea that the ""signatures"" involved in executing transactions on the bitcoin blockchain were or should be equivalent to signatures used in digital documents. ""It elides the distinction between signature and witness data and a digital signature, and they're two different things,"" Palley said. The comments come at a time when nChain is beginning to open up about its larger strategy after raising what it claims (but has yet to prove) is the most funding ever for an industry startup. nChain was sold to private investors in April, and is allegedly staffing up in advance of the launch of an alternative bitcoin software implementation, a move that would find it competing with Bitcoin Core's established software. Adding to the narrative is that nChain employs controversial developer Craig Wright, an Australian native who once claimed to be bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto only to retract that claim amid scrutiny. He has not since provided proof to satisfy the claim. One of the core critiques of the piece, however, pertains to its understanding of how the network would handle ""witness data"", or the cryptography that proves unspent bitcoins are able to be sent to another party. At issue is that under Segregated Witness, nodes running this version of the software would send transactions and blocks in a new format, meaning transactions would be cryptographically linked differently than they are today. One merkle tree would be used to record the data, while another would include data and a signature. Nodes receiving blocks in the older format, by not upgrading to Segregated Witness, would not receive the witness data. But even without receiving this data, technologists argue users would still be able to prove that the transactions were confirmed, and that they contained the correct signatures, if desired. Should they require it for business reasons, the argument is that not running a SegWit-enabled node would be impractical. Even assuming the argument that digital signatures need to be stored by the network itself to prove the legal validity of the transfer, technologists argued this could be satisfied by other means – namely, the proper storage of this data by the companies involved. ""There are other ways to cryptographically prove a transaction is correctly signed other than having a full node,"" said BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp. ""The assumption that if a transaction is in the blockchain, it's probably valid, is a fairly good guarantee."" Legal experts asserted that, because of this design, it's possible to prove that the transaction occurred between parties, even if those involved did not store signatures. For this reason, Coin Center director Jerry Brito argued that nChain is overstating the issues that would arise from the absence of this data. ""If you have one-time proof that you have the bitcoin, if you don't have it and I have it, logically it was signed over to me. As long as somebody in the world keeps the signature data and it's accessible, it's fine,"" he said. Florida lawyer Drew Hinkes went so far as to call the argument ""sound and fury"" that would have limited impact on the network, even if bitcoin transactions were applied to contracts. ""If the transaction made it on the blockchain, didn't it already have provably correct enforceable signatures that the two transacting parties can both keep?"" he asked. In remarks on Twitter, bitcoin legal specialist Patrick Murck expanded on the argument, honing in on nChain's claims this would be a problem perhaps only in instances where parties used the bitcoin blockchain as a way to establish legal contracts. The nChain article states: ""Years later, if you want to prove that you signed (or did not sign) a specific contract, you could find the signature block identifier, but you may not able to retrieve the physical signature block itself."" Here, Murck argued that, discounting the technical reasoning, the claim conflates bitcoin's signatures with the legal intent to execute a contract, which he argued isn't true. Santori went on to suggest that the technological change wouldn't have any impact on startups seeking to use the blockchain to prove that something occurred for this reason. ""E-sign law is talking about human assent to particular contractual terms. Just because cryptographers call this a signature, doesn't mean it's an assent to terms,"" he said. Lawyers queried also stressed that just because the word ""signature"" is used to define this process, that shouldn't mean it is captured under related law. As such, they pointed to a larger problem in the blockchain industry in which newcomers may equate the words used to express a concept incorrectly with other ideas. ""Calling something signature data, and assuming because it's signature data, it's a legal signature,"" Palley said. ""That may be the logical flaw here."" Representatives for nChain in response indicated that they ""stand by"" the article and welcome the debate that it has created. ""[We feel] this opinion piece is reasonable and it certainly does not misconstrue the law in any way,"" the company said, though it declined further engagement.

Payments are accepted by way of an integration with digital currency startup Coinbase, which automatically converts the crypto payments to US dollars. The preschools ascribe to the Montessori philosophy of education, an approach to learning developed in the early 20th century by Maria Montessori. According to online materials, tuition at the schools can run as high as $30,950 per annum – worth roughly 12.3 BTC at current prices. Marco Ciocco, co-founder and chairman of the schools, told CoinDesk that the move to accept digital currencies for tuition payments began more than a year ago, following requests from parents. As more requests came in, Ciocco said, school officials started to seriously weigh how it could work. He went on to explain: Ciocco, who said that he had personally been following the cryptocurrency space for the past several years, added that ""many"" parents had begun to utilize the payment option – a trend he expects to continue as time goes on. ""As a forward-thinking administration, we like to stay ahead of the curve and would not be surprised if the percentage of tuition paid in digital currencies continues to grow every year and becomes a substantial portion of our payments,"" Ciocco told CoinDesk.

The sentencing of Anthony Murgio comes months after he plead guilty to operating an unlicensed money transmission business in January. Murgio, along with alleged co-conspirator Yuri Lebedev, was first arrested and charged in the summer of 2015. Federal prosecutors later unveiled new charges against Murgio in November of that year Coin.mx was a Florida-based bitcoin exchange that federal prosecutors alleged acted as a financial conduit for the laundered proceeds of online criminal activity. The government sought as many as 10 years in jail for Murgio, a figure that the defense pushed back against earlier this month. Ultimately, US District Judge Alison Nathan opted for a sentencing term of roughly half that amount. Brian Klein of law firm Baker Marquart, one of the attorneys who represented Murgio, told CoinDesk in a statement: The exchange was tied to a broader cybercrime scheme that infamously targeted companies like JPMorgan Chase, resulting in the theft of data from tens of millions of the bank's customers. Another element of the case involved a New Jersey-based credit union, which prosecutors argued in court was used to transmit cybercrime-related funds overseas. That credit union was later shut down and its former chief executive was charged with aiding Coin.mx in exchange for accepting bribes. According to a report from Bloomberg, a follow-up hearing is set for 1st September, with Murgio remaining out on bail. Justice image via Shutterstock

                            Crypto Correction: Bitcoin and Ether Dive as Market Sheds $13 Billion                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-correction-bitcoin-ether-dive-market-sheds-13-billion/," Is the long-awaited 'crypto correction' finally here? There was certainly ample evidence to suggest the answer was yes today, as cryptocurrencies both large and small suffered widespread losses, a decline that analysts attributed to profit taking from veteran investors. Overall, the total market capitalization of cryptocurrencies fell to as little as $91.4bn today, a more than 20% decline from the all-time high of $117.2bn it reached around mid-June, and down over 13% from the day's open at $105.3bn. At the time of report, the top 20 cryptocurrencies as ranked by market capitalization had all suffered declines in the last 24 hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of leveraged cryptocurrency platform CryptoCompare, asserted in his comments that the decline was evidence of how hype had impacted the markets of late. With media outlets portraying the market as one driven by easy gains, investors drawn to the space, he said, did not know ""what they were getting into"". He said of the day's events: At press time, bitcoin was down 7% on the day's trading, while ether, the digital asset that powers the ethereum blockchain, was down nearly 20%. Other traders echoed Hayter's comments that traders were showing an appetite for profit taking. Brad Chun, chief investment officer of Shuttle Fund Advisor, pointed to profit taking, emphasizing that he believes veteran traders are using the decline to lock in gains made in the previous weeks. In addition to taking this specific action, some traders have been rebalancing their portfolios as of late, analysts told CoinDesk. ""People are taking cryptos off the table for fiat cash,"" Hayter told CoinDesk. Investor and crypto hedge fund manager Tim Enneking offered further detail, emphasizing that while some traders stick to cryptocurrencies, others trade fiat currencies as well, a factor that could have played a role. He said: Another factor that a handful of traders pointed out was that cryptocurrencies sometimes follow each other in terms of their price movements. Hayter emphasized the key role played by momentum, telling CoinDesk: ""Markets move in sync and when selling is the main momentum driver – traders follow the leader."" While cryptocurrencies don't always move in tandem, they appear to have moved together today. ""We are witnessing the still strong correlation between bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,"" Enneking observed. ""When bitcoin sees a large move down, as we've seen in the past 48 hours, it still has a tendency to take the entire rest of the market with it"". While the cryptocurrency has suffered a pullback lately, this may not be the last we have seen of the rally in these digital assets, traders told CoinDesk. Even after reaching today's low of $91.4bn, the market cap of all cryptocurrencies is up more than 400% year-to-date. After experiencing such sharp gains, it is ""healthy"" for cryptocurrencies to ""take a pause,"" Enneking told CoinDesk. Redwood City Ventures founder Sean Walsh perhaps best summed up the optimistic mood, concluding: Rushing water image via Shutterstock

                            Analyzing Ether: A Bitcoin Investor's Skeptical Take                        ",P4man,https://www.coindesk.com/analyzing-ether-bitcoin-investors-skeptical-take/,"'P4man' is an active bitcoin miner and investor with an academic background in economy and IT. He has been a member of the online discussion forum Bitcoin Talk since September, 2011. In this opinion piece, P4man looks at the cryptocurrency market to see if there is a credible alternative to bitcoin. Can ethereum cut the mustard? I've been following (and holding) bitcoin since 2012. I admit that until recently, I've largely ignored altcoins because none of the early cryptocurrencies offered any substantial advantage over bitcoin. At best, they were clones with a few minor tweaks, at worst, heavily pre-mined ""scamcoins"" primarily designed as a money grab scheme for developers and a few promoters. After seeing a few dozen of those, I had seen enough. But today, due to the scaling issue, bitcoin is in a crisis, and altcoins have overtaken bitcoin in market cap. While many will consider me a lucky early bitcoin adopter, clearly, I'm late to the altcoin party. So, it was long overdue that I took another look at this market to see if perhaps today there is a credible alternative to bitcoin or some promising coins to help me diversify my crypto investment. So, I dove in, started reading and talking to people, to see what the buzz was about. Let me be clear, I don't claim to be an overnight expert in any of these coins now. I may have gotten some facts wrong, but I'm going to give you my impressions. Take them for what they are worth. First, a general observation. Many people I talked to say they invest in altcoins and ICOs because they feel they missed the boat with bitcoin and presume newly launched coins offer them a similar opportunity. This is a fallacy. When bitcoin was launched, no one knew for sure if cryptocurrency would even work at all. Few people believed it would ever gain traction and be understood and trusted by millions of people, let alone, become a multibillion-dollar phenomena. Even though I held bitcoin, you may count me among those early doubters. But that doubt was priced in. That uncertainty over the core concept itself was the main reason that a pizza once cost 10,000 BTC. Now that the protocol itself has worked flawlessly for eight years, and the blockchain market as a whole achieved the recognition, penetration and value that it has, most of that doubt has evaporated. It's still early, but cryptographic blockchain technology has proven itself, and most people now believe it has significant potential. A new coin today may be unproven, but the concepts it is based on, are not. That part of bitcoin's early and exponential value growth, which represents a shift from initial ridicule to increasing trust and understanding of blockchain technology, can never be repeated. You cannot turn back that clock and un-invent blockchain technology. Moreover, bitcoin wasn't launched through an ICO like almost altcoins these days. Bitcoin started off with a valuation of approximately zero. It took 4–5 years of proving itself, building trust and adoption for it to grow by dozens of thousands of percent, and only then reach the market cap of a typical ICO launch today. So, a new coin today, simply cannot have the growth potential that bitcoin had in its earliest days, and you can't even get in at the same bottom price. If that is why you are investing in ICOs, then don't. Of course, that doesn't mean they can't substantially grow in value, so let's take a look at that. The overall crypto market has exploded this year, breaching $100bn recently. Let me be the first to freely admit I have no idea if this is a low or high valuation for current blockchain implementations. Good arguments can be made to value existing cryptocurrencies anywhere from a tiny fraction of their current market cap, to trillions of dollars. I'm not even going to attempt to make a fiat-denominated value estimation. Your guess is as good mine. However, I do feel it's reasonable to make value comparisons between blockchains. To do that, first we need to understand what functions give a cryptographic token value. Here are the functions I look at, in no particular order: Speculative value, isn't value. It's just speculation on future value. With that in mind, let's take a look at the most popular altcoin currently: ethereum. Despite a market cap that is almost on par with bitcoin, as a transactional currency, ethereum has not achieved much, if anything yet – I'm ignoring ICOs for now. I will consider that as part of its derived value. Compared to the hundreds of thousands of online shops that accept bitcoin, ethereum is hardly used at all for online purchases, there is no merchant infrastructure, there are no payment providers like BitPay that I've found and I see little evidence it's used for remittance or other transactional purposes. I’m also not convinced ethereum is well suited for this purpose. While bitcoin has an urgent scaling problem, making it currently less than ideal for (micro) transactions, the fix for this is relatively simple from a technological point of view – the problem is mostly political. Despite hearing many claims to the contrary, ethereum with its vastly more complex blockchain, has a much bigger scaling problem than bitcoin, that is yet to be solved, even in theory. Concepts exist to address this problem (""sharding"" etc), but those do not exist yet and may not even work. So, in its current form, ethereum is not a viable alternative to bitcoin as a transactional currency, and it remains to be seen if it ever can be and will be. As a store of wealth, ether faces even larger problems. Due to its complexity and by allowing code to run inside the blockchain, it creates a lot of potential for bugs and opens up attack vectors. This has already caused at least five hard forks and one blockchain split. Fundamental properties are still being worked on, not just from an implementation perspective but conceptually. For instance, it's currently unknown what the future inflation rate will be, or even how the network will be protected (whether via proof-of-work or proof-of-stake). Everything seems to be in flux and under development. It's also difficult to trust a blockchain that has proven not to be immutable and rolls back transactions that are considered ""unfair"". All this just adds to the sense of uncertainty. For a store of wealth, nothing is more important than trust and predictability, and ethereum currently offers neither. Even if these major issues get resolved and clarified eventually, I'm not convinced ethereum is even the right concept for a store of wealth. Intertwining store of value and such broad functionality in one complex, ever-changing blockchain, just doesn't make much sense to me. That's no criticism of the project, as I don't believe ethereum was designed for this, nor do I see core developers make such claims. On the contrary, it should be clear by now that ethereum's major appeal, and the only possible reasonable ground for its current valuation, should lie in its derived value. By focusing on smart contract functionality, ethereum does allow a wealth of functionality to run inside its blockchain, in a way that's currently very difficult or impossible to do with bitcoin or other blockchains. ICOs are by far the most popular use case for this, and to its credit, ethereum has enabled hundreds of millions of dollars-worth of funding via this method. It's probably fair to say the ethereum's technology is what enabled most of the recent altcoin market explosion. This is indeed, quite an impressive achievement. These ICOs drive demand for ether in two ways: First, most of the ICOs are priced in ether, so investors wanting to participate usually have to buy ether first. You could say ether does function as a transactional currency here, be it for a very specific application. Secondly, processing of smart contracts and private tokens on its blockchain have to be paid for in ""gas"", which really is just ether. This creates some demand for ether, even when projects implemented on ethereum use a private token, and only allow funding of that token with fiat money, as is the case, for instance, with the often referenced RWE electric vehicle charge station project. First, let's take a look at the gas. At the time of writing, the average daily use of gas was roughly 12bn and the average gas price was 0.000000022 ether. That means a total daily average of 260 ether (or around $100,000). For comparison sake, bitcoin, which no sane person will claim derives its value primarily from transaction fees, averaged 400 BTC in daily transaction fees (or around $1m). If you think gas usage justifies ethereum's market cap, then bitcoin ought to be worth 10 times more, based on its arguably least-desirable metric alone. That leaves us with the one remaining rational price driver that I can see for ethereum: financing ICOs. Clearly, this is a huge market. It's hard to fathom how large this market has become virtually overnight. The amount of capital being raised through ICOs is now roughly on par with Kickstarter! But as basis for its current valuation, even that doesn't quite make sense, given that ethereum’s own current market cap is many times larger than all the ICOs it has ever helped finance. Moreover, the companies that launched ether-denominated ICOs are not likely to hold onto most of their ether for a very long time – they raised the money to finance their own development (of potentially competing tokens, no less). They will need to spend substantial portions of their ICO money to pay for services, salaries, offices, promotion, etc, and virtually none of that can be paid for in ether. So, they will need to sell their ether again. Then there is the legal aspect: ethereum is breaking new ground. By providing a platform for private tokens and smart contracts, it's blurring the line between virtual currencies and securities. In a way, this is exciting and certainly innovative. But, it's hard to see how at least some private tokens issued on the ethereum blockchain, could be considered anything other than unregistered securities that violate regulation in virtually every country. This gives me a déjà vu, as I argued the same many years ago when bitcoin stock exchanges like GLBSE where all the rage. Those exchanges allowed the issuing and trading of unregistered, bitcoin-denominated securities (company stocks, mining and other bonds, loans), no different than some private tokens on ethereum today. IPOs of virtual companies were as much a hype back then as ICOs of virtual currencies today. And one more parallel I find difficult to ignore: Virtually all assets that were traded on these exchanges, even the ones that weren't plain scams and Ponzi schemes, were hopelessly overvalued. They were bought because prices were expected to go up. Even when the prices exceeded any remotely rational valuation of the underlying assets, including mining bonds, simple arithmetic would prove beyond a doubt that they could never return a profit. Those ""stock exchanges"" were eventually all closed by authorities, and some of the issuers of securities got in serious legal trouble. I don't know what, if anything will happen with ethereum-based ICOs, or how it might affect ethereum, but it is a concern one should not ignore. Especially not when ICOs appear to be by far the primary driver of ether value. In short, ethereum is, without a doubt, a much more exciting blockchain than bitcoin. It's like comparing an operating system to a paper ledger. But that doesn't make it a better investment. So, what is ether's value proposition today? It's unused (and arguably not quite usable yet) as a general transaction currency; it's too uncertain to be trusted as a secure store of wealth; and it has a derived value that appears almost entirely dependent on legally dubious ICOs that can’t go on forever. Ether as a currency, I fear, is misunderstood by many, and compared to bitcoin at least, substantially more risky and overvalued.

                            Top Secret? Bitcoin Scaling Plan Segwit2x Leaves More Questions Than Answers                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/top-secret-bitcoin-scaling-plan-segwit2x-leaves-questions-answers/,"After years of debate, the Segwit2x scaling proposal looks like it could play a role in – finally – taking bitcoin a step forward. But the coders and companies involved have been doing at least some of the development behind closed doors, a way of working that some argue runs counter to bitcoin's value proposition as a decentralized money that no one person, or group, controls. The project, which follows in a long line of proposals for increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity, is now supported by an all-time-high of nearly 90% of the bitcoin mining hashrate. Since the current method of triggering major code changes relies on the support of mining pools, it seems likely that the first portion of the agreement, SegWit, will activate on the network by the end of July. (Although, it's hard to say what will happen with the rest of the proposal.) But, while Segwit2x is perhaps the most widely-supported scaling agreement among companies and mining pools following years of debate, some have argued that key decisions are being made by an insular group of companies. These companies, some argue, have continued pushing the proposal through even though many of the developers that are perhaps the most familiar with bitcoin's code find fault with the technical implementation and disagree with the stated goals. And those same companies have been elusive when it comes to details about the status of the proposal itself. Segwit2x was kick-started at an invite-only meeting comprised of big companies and large mining pools in the space. From the beginning, one of the main criticisms levied against Segwit2x is that its development process isn't open to everyone. And many argue this process doesn't jibe with bitcoin's history of open-source development. There is certainly evidence to the contrary. Btc1, as the Segwit2x software implementation is called, is hosted on GitHub where any developer is welcome to point out bugs and suggest improvements. This open process has indeed already led to major changes in the project's direction. Similarly, the mailing list is open for anyone in the community to at least peruse – if not post to. In other ways, the effort is staying true to its secretive origin story. There's an invite-only Slack group, where companies that originally pledged to contribute are represented, including Abra, Bitfury, BitGo, BitPay, Blockchain, Bloq, BTCC, Ledger, RSK Labs and Xapo. Others included in the Slack group are OB1, Purse and developers from the alternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin XT, which aimed to increase bitcoin's block size parameter to 8MB in 2015. Most of these companies and individuals who have committed developer resources, though, declined to provide specific information in response to CoinDesk requests to understand their involvement. Some companies did not respond at all. Others confirmed that they're involved in development, but declined to be more specific about which developers are involved and what they're working on. ""We are also contributing technical expertise to the Segwit2x code, which is in its test phase right now on a separate testnet,"" said Valery Vavilov, CEO of The BitFury Group. Many company responses were similarly vague. Yet Vavilov continued: Companies are currently testing the code on the newly-deployed testnet. On Thursday, the group released a public testnet faucet, which produces fake bitcoins that developers can use. A number of developers are tuned into the effort, as seen on the GitHub and the Segwit2x project mailing list. Those two resources make it easy to see a few of the people involved in development, including posted contributions from Bloq CEO Jeff Garzik and Purse.io CTO Christopher Jeffrey. While Digital Currency Group (DCG) CEO Barry Silbert is often viewed as the public face and linchpin of the effort (it’s often called the ""Silbert Agreement""), he noted he's ""not involved on the development side at all"", and so can't comment on the process any more than what's already been published. Despite knowledge of the process, there are gaps in the community's understanding of what's being developed, such as who specifically is contributing to the effort and what they are contributing. Those who are not contributing, according to Lightening Labs CEO Elizabeth Stark, are those who have disagreed with the proposal in some way. Stark said her company provided technical feedback to Segwit2x because they didn't agree with the proposal for ""various technical reasons"". And according to Stark, they were not invited to participate further. ""This proposal has like zero developer consensus,"" she said, referring to Bitcoin Core developers, most of whom have outright rejected the project. She added: Again, opponents said, this philosophy contrasts with bitcoin's open development process so far, which invites all developers to contribute their ideas. A loose group of volunteer developers work on Bitcoin Core, for example, where development, for the most part, is done out in the open. On the other hand, Segwit2x's closed approach to development ""allows people to self-vindicate, and shields you from peer review and public commentary,"" wrote Blockstream CEO Adam Back in an email to the working group. He continued: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Abra, BitGo, BitPay, Blockstream, Bloq, BTCC, Ledger, OB1, Purse.io, RSK Labs and Xapo.  Hands behind a blue door image via Shutterstock

In a report from English-language media source The Nation, members of a Buddhist temple in the town of Uttaradit were said to have been approached with offers to invest in bitcoin. The temple-goers were allegedly promised handsome profits if they invested ""at least 38,000 baht"" (an amount worth roughly $1,100 at press time), including a doubling of that return if they attracted other investors. A representative of the group filed a report with Thailand's Department of Special Investigation (DSI), prompting the first stages of an investigation over concerns it might be a pyramid scheme, in which early investors are paid out with the proceeds from new ones. As many as 800 practitioners from Uttaradit, Pathum Thani and Chiang Mai have contributed to the fund, the report said. While no one from the group has confirmed any loss so far, the DSI said the promise was ""too good to be true"" and that it will investigate to ""check whether the operation is illegal"". The case is not the first possible digital currency-based scam to emerge in Thailand. In 2015, police launched an investigation into a scheme called UFUN that also attracted investors with promises of high returns. Buddha statues image via Shutterstock

                            A Bitcoin Scaling Upgrade: How It Could Finally Happen (And How It Could Fail)                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-scaling-upgrade-finally-happen-fail/,"Bitcoin, it seems, has one of two futures. Either the $40bn economic network that still defies scientists is on the verge of the biggest change in the network's history, or the most advanced of its many long-theorized scaling compromises is headed toward its biggest political failure. In recent weeks and months, the likely outcome has shifted quickly, often daily, as the varying stakeholders and competing proposals have jockeyed for position, media attention, and in some cases, actual headspace in the form of creative political attire. What has been less visible, however, is that, in the midst of the chaos, bitcoin has been progressing, slowly and messily, to the point where some sort of action in the years-long effort to increase its transaction capacity seems likely to be taken. This is partly because of a key proposal that emerged last month. After convening in a meeting in May, a group of entrepreneurs and miners put forward Segwit2x, certainly not the first, but arguably the most advanced alternative to the roadmap long advocated by Bitcoin Core, the network's open-source developer group. Armed with the commitments from the majority of bitcoin's mining pools, the group, comprising more than 50 startups and organized by investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group, now has enough influence to push through at least the first portion of the agreement, though it's not without its dissenters. Come August, a number of outcomes are plausible. Some are more likely than others. Bitcoin could be upgraded smoothly, or not. But, the big conclusion could play out in many different ways. For the moment, the most important takeaway may be that every group is pushing for a change known as Segregated Witness. Bitcoin Core's original roadmap, the Segwit2x plan and users rallying around a change known as a 'user-activated soft fork' (UASF), all call for the upgrade. Introduced already to no ill effect on the litecoin network, SegWit could provide a boost to bitcoin's transaction capacity among other enhancements. But it has yet to activate on its own. (Some mining pool operators and mining hardware companies have long pushed back against the proposal, though the motivations here are varied.) But as all the proposals now ultimately support SegWit on different terms, many in the community see this as a sign that SegWit is finally going to activate this summer. The question is whether it could ultimately lead to a split into two bitcoins, due to how the upgrades are set up. For one, some mining pools are showing signs that they want to take aggressive measures to hard fork bitcoin to a 2MB block-size parameter. If that happens, it's possible that bitcoin could split into two competing assets later in the summer. The tricky part is that the debate is constantly shifting. But, to help understand the current state, here's a timeline of what could happen: Described formally in BIP 141, SegWit was first released last November. Today, as many as 80% of bitcoin nodes are running it. And though it has grown contentious, it's important to note SegWit was originally billed as a 'compromise', since it increases the block size (though not in a way that changes the hard-coded 'block size').  Partly because of this, the idea did not please everyone. Namely, most mining pools did not upgrade their software in support of SegWit, either because they did not agree with the change or because they were indifferent.  Because of the contention around SegWit, others have been looking for a way to boost capacity that aligns with more stakeholders. Segwit2x is one alternative proposal that combines SegWit with an increase to a 2MB block-size parameter. Most major bitcoin companies and mining pools representing 80% of the hashrate signed the proposal. As noted earlier, the compromise might be working. As of Monday, the majority of the bitcoin mining hashrate is signaling support for Segwit2x. This is a non-binding show of support. But the code is set to be officially released by 21st July, according to the technical working group timelines. Once that happens, mining pools can run and signal support for the change. If 80% of mining pools run the code for 672 blocks, over a period of four to five days, then SegWit will lock in. Although it's non-binding, it's notable that the mining pools plan to lock-in SegWit the day before 1st August (more on that below). Three months later, the second portion of the agreement, the 2MB block-size increase, is supposed to kick in. The problem is that if not all users upgrade, this could lead bitcoin to split into two assets. At least some users have said that they don't plan to. Timeline: Signaling for the change begins on 21st July. Three months after SegWit is activated, users will need to upgrade their software if they want to support the 2MB block-size parameter increase. Who supports it? Most major companies and mining pools. If mining pools lock in Segwit2x by 31st July, then that might be it. Otherwise the following events could unravel. BIP 148 UASF also aims to activate SegWit, but it takes a different approach. It rekindles an older way of making consensus upgrades to bitcoin, one that doesn't explicitly ask mining pools for support before pushing through a code change. (Some in the community are calling it bitcoin's 'Independence Day' for that reason.) Many users and some companies are already running code that could trigger this type of soft fork. At this point, nodes will start rejecting blocks that do not signal support for SegWit. That's why the idea is controversial. As these nodes reject the blocks, they're effectively pushing them to a different network. It's a controversial idea because, like the above hard fork, it could lead bitcoin to split into two competing cryptocurrencies, both called bitcoin. But, some argue that it has more of a psychological affect. For example, some believe that mining pools rallied around Segwit2x on Monday in response to growing support for BIP 148. The idea is that, if they don't want bitcoin to split, SegWit needs to be activated somehow prior to that date. Timeline: On 1st August, nodes that are running BIP 148 will start rejecting blocks from miners that do not support SegWit. Who supports it? Some users, some businesses, some miners and some developers, but like the other proposals, support is split. If BIP 148 gets off the ground on 1st August, mining firm Bitmain plans to roll out a ""user-activated hard fork"" (UAHF) in response. This could potentially protect users' money in the event of a split, according to the company, by making the split more permanent. In theory, a bitcoin hard fork could provide protection from a 'wipe out', where transactions on one version of the blockchain might accidentally be erased. Still, mining pools might lose money if they end up mining a competing fork. So, some are calling the the Bitmain UAHF a bluff. Another mining firm, ViaBTC, unveiled a related plan on Monday to guard against the prospect that some in the community may not uphold the 2MB increase portion of the Segwit2x agreement. The far-fetched goal is to incentivize the creation of a bitcoin with bigger blocks by raising the funds to do so via an initial coin offering (ICO). Timeline: If BIP 148 triggers, Bitmain will start mining a private chain and open it up to more bitcoin users if there’s enough support. Who supports it? Two mining firms, Bitmain and ViaBTC. Still, it's possible that all these scaling efforts will become obsolete once mining pools lock in Segwit2x. If not, though, there is the more complex timeline to keep in mind. Meanwhile, there are other complexities to the argument, not the least of which is that it can seem like bitcoin users are voiceless in the middle of all this in-fighting. This was the highlight of a debate between Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Peter Smith, CEO of bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain, on a mailing list last week. There, Back argued that users don't want a small group of entities dictating the rules of what's supposed to be a decentralized currency, while Smith asserted that its wallet users want cheaper fees. Given the complexities of the outcomes above, bitcoin's biggest question now may not be whether it will upgrade, but whose vision for the network will win out when it does (or doesn't).

Known as Segwit2x, the proposal – if passed – could mark a significant advancement in bitcoin's years-long scaling debate, effectively spurring the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit), a scaling proposal introduced by developers in 2015, and doubling the current 1 MB block size. But while the actual Segwit2x code is not ready for mining pools to run yet (it's still in the testing phase until 30th June), this isn't stopping mining pools from demonstrating they support the measure. Mining pools AntPool, Bitcoin.com, Bitfury, Bixin, BTC.com, BTC.top, BW Pool, F2Pool, and ViaBTC (which represent about 71% of the network's mining power) are already adding a piece of text to each block that they mine to show their support. Once the code is ready for showtime on 21st July, mining pools will be able to run the software. The Segwit2x scaling agreement will require 80% of the mining hashrate to run the code for roughly three days starting on that date. Mining firms already announced their intent to support Segwit2x, but after a meeting in Chengdu last week, 16 total mining manufacturers, exchanges and mining pools ""unanimously"" agreed to a set of resolutions, including their intent to follow through with locking in SegWit by 31st July. As such, the roundtable bears similarities to past miner meetings, such as one held in late-April where mining pools agreed to signal support for SegWit on litecoin, an alternative blockchain platform. In the resolution, there is also no explicit mention of BIP 148, a soft fork that aims to lock-in SegWit in a different way, and whose supporters have been vocal about what they feel has been a resistance to SegWit over political and social issues. As for whether the full terms of Segwit2x will be enacted, however, that remains to be seen. A hard fork has long been seen as a contentious move by developers and some users. (Mining pool ViaBTC is already taking steps to indicate it could take aggressive actions to ensure a hard fork would enforce a 2 MB upgrade). As such, it remains unclear what the final impact of Segwit2x will be on the network, and how many mining pools will ultimately run the terms of the resolution.

                            Forfeit Your Bitcoin? Congressional Bill Draws Fire Over Border Check Rules                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/forfeit-bitcoin-congressional-bill-draws-fire-border-check-rules/,"A group of US lawmakers wants to see cryptocurrency holdings declared at the nation's border – and advocates of the tech are pushing back. Introduced last month, the Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act of 2017 – which is actually the third iteration of a bill that debuted in 2011 – would bring a range of digital currency services under federal scrutiny, including those that provide transaction mixing services. Yet, the provision that has attracted the particular ire of cryptocurrency advocates – especially those who prefer a regulation-light environment – is one that would make such holdings subject to disclosure requirements at US customs checkpoints. This means if a person trying to enter the country has more than $10,000 worth of bitcoin in their possession, under the proposed legal change, they would need to inform the relevant authorities. Such requirements are already in place for payment methods like cash. But given the rising public profile of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, coupled with the perception among policymakers that they could be used to fund terrorist activities, is driving legislative efforts like the bill currently under consideration. One observer, Joe Ciccolo of Canada-based BitAML, remarked that cryptocurrency has become the ""new face in an old debate"", going on to say that policymakers and law enforcement officials have long sought to expand the definition of what constitutes a ""monetary instrument"". Ciccolo told CoinDesk: Perianne Boring, president of the Chamber of Digital Commerce, a blockchain trade advocacy organization, said the legislation is ""not necessary"" given the existence of regulations from the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which require exchanges services to register as money transmission businesses and adhere to federal reporting requirements. ""While we encourage thoughtful and meaningful study of the prevention of cross-border financial crime, the storage of virtual currency carries different and complex considerations than those attributable to prepaid access,"" she told CoinDesk. It's clear from the response that the frustration toward the measure isn't going anywhere. That anger surfaced in earnest over the past week or so in social media postings and fiery blog entries about the move. One of the points of concern is a policy called 'civil asset forfeiture'. In the US, law enforcement officials have faced strong opposition to the rules, by which assets, particularly cash, can be seized if they are suspected of being connected to criminal activity. Proponents say it deters money laundering and – controversially – provides a funding means for police forces in the US. Under the proposed bill, cryptocurrencies would be included in that definition, subject to confiscation by border agents. The practice has drawn fire in recent years over instances in which innocent people have their funds taken from them, triggering legal processes that can play out for months or longer before any money is returned. In one high-profile example in 2015, a US man had $16,000 in cash taken from him while he tried to relocate to Hollywood despite the fact that he wasn't suspected of a specific crime. And data published earlier this month by the Chicago Tribune illustrated how the policy tends to target lower-income residents who, if anything, are guilty of crimes of lower severity, if at all. Investor and writer Simon Black, who pens the Sovereign Man blog, took aim at this aspect of the bill by declaring that, in the eyes of the US government, ""bitcoin is evil"" and should be up for grabs by border agents. ""So, theoretically if you leave the US with more than $10,000 in bitcoin or ether, you'd have to confess this fact to the authorities or otherwise face the aforementioned penalties, ie prison time, civil asset forfeiture, etc,"" Black wrote. ""HOORAY FREEDOM!"" he added. Thus far, the bill hasn’t advanced significantly since being introduced last month, public records show. On 25th May, the measure was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee for further consideration. At press time, representatives for Senators Chuck Grassley and Diane Feinstein hadn't responded to CoinDesk requests for comment. The bill is also being sponsored by Senators John Cornyn and Sheldon Whitehouse, constituting a group of two Republicans and two Democrats. But at least one person is moving to wage a war against the bill’s provisions: Theo Chino, who as profiled by CoinDesk last November, has waged a persistent campaign against the New York State Department of Financial Services BitLicense regulatory framework. He told CoinDesk in an email that he has set up a webpage with the relevant contact information for the senators who are sponsoring the bill. Chino himself has been reaching out to offices in an effort to educate lawmakers on what he described as ""misunderstandings of the technology"". ""This 'over-criminalization' of bitcoin, based on common misunderstandings of the technology and its economic nature should be worrisome to the bitcoin and technology communities,"" he told CoinDesk. The two main advocacy groups in Washington, DC – the Chamber of Digital Commerce and Coin Center – are said to be in contact with the relevant Congressional offices. Though it declined to comment on this story, Coin Center indicated on Twitter that it's reaching out amid the furor. ""We are aware of S 1241, are in touch with the relevant folks in Congress, and will post an analysis soon,"" executive director Jerry Brito wrote on Twitter. Chino – who in an email called the bill a ""sham"" – spoke to the grassroots effort taking place, and said that he’s still reaching out to people who have posted on Reddit as part of a broader bid to get constituents to contact the senators involved. ""One call from a constituent has so much impact,"" he said. US flag over fence image via Shutterstock

Less than a year ago, Vinny Troia, CEO and principal security consultant of Night Lion Security and a certified white hat hacker, was sent a compliance form by US bitcoin exchange Coinbase, where he had an account. Coinbase wanted to know how Troia was using bitcoin and his account. ""I told them I run a security firm. I pay for ransoms and buy documents on the dark web when clients request it,"" Troia told CoinDesk. The ransoms Troia helps his clients pay are those stemming from ransomware attacks, which have surged in number over the past few years. Many, like the well-publicized WannaCry attack, are asking for bitcoin. And the documents? Troia said: According to Troia, Coinbase ""did not like that at all"". Coinbase then asked the IT expert whether he had a letter from the Department of Justice giving him permission to do those things. No, Troia said. Upon further research, Troia has not found that any such permission exists. But, ""I have my clients authorizing me to do this,"" he said. Coinbase sent Troia back an email explaining that those actions were against the exchange's rules and shut down his account. Troia then tried setting up an account with his wife's information, but that too was shut down. Then he tried his brother. Shut down. Then his mother. Shut down. ""My entire family is blocked from Coinbase,"" he said. The problem is ransomware attacks are on the rise, and the prevalence of those attackers requesting bitcoin over bags of cash (or even wired fiat funds) is also up. Black hat hackers love bitcoin, primarily because its wallets don't have to be registered with a central intermediary, and with the use of anonymizing mixers and tumblers, the movement of that money can be hard to track. Last month, several publications reported companies stockpiling bitcoin in preparation for future ransomware attacks. According to Citrix Systems, in 2016, about one-third of British companies were hoarding a store of ""digital monies"" to recover critical data in the event of an attack. Sometimes, it's the only option. Troia, who is based in St Louis, worked with a vendor last year who was hit with a ransomware attack performing full disk encryption. In this case, full disk encryption meant the hackers had encrypted all the data held on the company’s hard drive storage. And according to Troia, almost no companies, including the one he was called to help at 2:00 am on a Sunday morning, keep full disk backups. Troia scrambled around looking for ways to purchase bitcoin quickly and get the attackers paid. His solution:  purchasing bitcoin through a bitcoin ATM at a mall in  St Louis. While the process took nearly 24 hours, without the bitcoin ATM, it would have taken even longer with waiting periods for bitcoin account onboarding and purchasing and withdrawal limits, Troia said. He even tried the Craigslist-like LocalBitcoins service, but since it was Sunday, a bank wire transfer wouldn't be initiated till the next week. ""When someone has to pay a ransom, they need to pay it right away, not wait four days or so,"" he said. ""The consequences [of waiting] are more on the business side, reputational risk, with customers trying to get access to the system and not being able to. And there can be significant financial impacts of customers' inability to access the system."" It seems almost antithetical that it's becoming harder for the 'good guys' to use bitcoin, when companies like Coinbase that operate with the digital currency have an uphill battle convincing individuals, businesses and government agencies that cryptocurrency should not be faulted for the bad actors' use of it. But, according to Juan Llanos, a cryptocurrency compliance expert and the fintech and regtech lead at blockchain startup ConsenSys, it's all part of the same battle. ""Coinbase is meeting the expectations and standards of any highly regulated and scrutinized financial institution,"" Llanos told CoinDesk. ""They are a systemically important player and are backed by big-name investors. They all are, as they need to be, cognizant of the reputational and regulatory risks of associating themselves with negative news and potentially bad actors."" He continued: Seems so. The non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, for example, voiced strong opinions last month about a court filing which suggested helping someone exchange fiat for bitcoin to pay a ransomware attack might be unlawful.  The policy-focused non-profit declined to comment for this story, though Neeraj Agrawal, Coin Center’s director of communications, did say: ""The decisions that Coinbase or any other company make about who can and cannot use their platforms are private matters internal to those companies."" Brought against Coin.mx, the court filing stated that the exchange violated anti-money laundering law in that it ""knowingly processed and profited from numerous bitcoin transactions conducted on behalf of victims of ransomware schemes"". Judicial actions such as this obviously make others wary. ""I don't blame them,"" said Llanos. Although, while federal law enforcement agencies typically caution US businesses against paying digital ransoms, in October 2015, FBI agent Joseph Bonavolonta told C-level business executives they might be better served succumbing to attackers requests for ransom in return for data. Coinbase offered little comment on the situation. ""We work with a number of third-party vendors and need to make sure we comply with the types of businesses and activity they are comfortable with us servicing,"" said David Farmer, director of business operations at Coinbase. Farmer also sent a link to the exchange's publicly available terms and conditions and prohibited business activity list. While neither document states anything specifically about white hat hacking or ransomware, the prohibited business activity list does note that it's ""representative, but not exhaustive."" This gives Coinbase sole discretion to remove an account that increases any risk to its business. Troia isn't the only security consultant doing this kind of work at the behest of legitimate and paying clients.  Although, he doesn't know exactly why his account was flagged for suspicious activity in the first place. In this light, he wonders whether the accounts he sent ransom payments to might have already been flagged as problematic. ""I could never figure it out,"" he said. ""I had, maybe traded an entire bitcoin, literally one. I didn't have a high volume of trading."" Troia recently tried reaching out to Coinbase executives, including CEO Brian Armstrong, explaining the situation, and that theoretically he could have lied and kept his account, hoping the truth angle could win him some points. Via email, Armstrong said he would look into it, and forwarded Troia's email to the support team. The next day, though, Troia got a message back from support, saying upon further inspection, he was still unable to open an account, whether it be business or personal. And that looks unlikely to change.

It's the first auction of its kind. According to the Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO), the country's asset management operation that oversees state-owned properties and development, any seized financial assets including digital currencies became government properties, subject to public auctions.

                            Bitcoin Scaling Proposal Segwit2x Moves Ahead With Initial Code Release                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/first-look-bitcoin-scaling-proposal-segwit2x-gets-alpha-release/,"The working group behind the Segwit2x bitcoin scaling proposal has announced that the first version of its code is now ready for review and testing. As such, the release provides the market with a first look at the technology underlying one of the most broadly supported bids to enhance the network. Announced in May as an ""agreement"" that united miners and startups, Segwit2x is an alternative technology roadmap to one proposed by Bitcoin Core, the network's open-source developer group. It has since emerged as a frequent subject of praise, criticism and discussion. However, in what could be a promising sign, Segwit2x could become a moderate option that helps to avoid a contentious network split, and it looks like it could end up being somewhat compatible with an alternative proposal, the user-activated soft fork (UASF) BIP 148, which, as coded, will activate on 1st August. The news is notable because earlier this week any compatibility between the two proposals seemed less likely – a discordance that raised fears of a split of the blockchain into two competing assets. The development became apparent on Wednesday, when bitcoin developer James Hilliard submitted a change request, along with a code change that would reduce the time it takes for mining pools to lock in the update. On GitHub, Hilliard said: By reducing that time, mining pools will have one (or maybe two) three-day periods in which they can lock-in a controversial code change called Segregated Witness (SegWit) by signaling support using the SegWit2x software before the UASF occurs on August 1st. Though, it's unclear if mining pools will decide to do so. The request was well-received, being met with several 'ACKs' – developer shorthand for 'agreed', and a sign of approval. The alpha release of SegWit2x includes a working version of the software, which combines two changes, the scaling optimization SegWit and an increased 2MB block-size parameter. The increase to 2MB is now scheduled for three months after SegWit activates, according to an email from BitGo CEO Mike Belshe. Prior to this, it's been less clear (even to some SegWit2x participants) when the 2MB hard fork would take place. ""Segwit2x development has been moving quickly according to plan, and the project is in good shape,"" Belshe said, in the message to the working group. The 2MB block size has long been a point of contention, partially because it could lead to a blockchain split if not everyone agrees to upgrade to the new blockchain code. Further, some in the industry have already suggested they don't plan to. However, SegWit2x has won the support of most major bitcoin companies and mining firms, in total representing over 80% of bitcoin's hash rate. (Though it remains unclear how reliable this support will be owing partly to fatigue around the issue). With the alpha version out, the wider community now gets to review and test the software. The release also includes a new bitcoin testnet that developers can use to put the software through its paces and identify any bugs. Developers can trial the software using the new test network, called testnet5, for the next two weeks. ""We are planning to conduct rounds of testing against the new testnet5 including everyone from the working group who would like to participate,"" BitPay senior developer Justin Langston said in another email to the working group. The plan for these rounds is to simulate the code's deployment lifecycle, from signaling support for SegWit to activating the 2MB block-size parameter. These rounds of testing and review are aimed to help avoid any future network problems, such as, in a worst-case scenario, the loss of users' bitcoin. In the email, Langston wrote: Feedback on SegWit2x's  plan has already been rolling in. One working group participant argued there is potential for 'replay attacks' in the event of a hard fork. Replay attacks, in the event of a split leaving the community with two bitcoin tokens, could allow users to accidentally spend their bitcoin on both networks. This confusion happened last summer when ethereum split into two coins, leading some companies to lose money. The participant argued that protection from this confusing and potentially dangerous issue is needed within Segwit2x's code. Some Bitcoin Core developers have also criticized Segwit2x's development timeline as being too short, because it often takes a significant amount of time to catch all errors associated with bitcoin code changes. SegWit itself was tested for over a year before it was launched. So far, though, SegWit2x developers haven't skipped a beat, saying the project will continue to move forward along the original timeline, with the beta release scheduled for 30th June. On 21st July, users will be able to run and signal the fully vetted software, according to the group.

                            Game of Bluffs? With UAHF, Bitcoin Scaling Becomes Digital 'Missile Crisis'                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/game-of-bluffs-with-bitmain-plan-bitcoin-scaling-becomes-digital-missile-crisis/,"Long a sort of Cold War, bitcoin's scaling debate is escalating into what may be best described as a digital Cuban Missile Crisis. No longer open for diplomacy, users of the $40bn economic network, which hit an all-time high in value last weekend, are now in the midst of evaluating an ever-increasing array of threats from various network stakeholders, each of whom is seeking to steer discourse and development. In yet another turn to the scaling debate, major mining firm Bitmain revealed yesterday a strategy outlining how it will respond should a controversial bitcoin code upgrade known as BIP 148 – a change the firm opposes – activate later this summer. In a blog post, the company outlined its ""contingency plan"" if users attempt to force a protocol change, thereby circumventing the network's current structure in which those running its mining machines signal for upgrades. Most notably, the proposal would dedicate mining resources to hard forking the network to a rule set with a larger block size – an upgrade that would likely result in two bitcoin networks and two tradeable bitcoin assets. In response, the firm, long the center of bitcoin's long-running debate and often the foil to the open-source network's developers, invited the wider bitcoin community to join the effort. Admittedly, there been many proposals that could have lead to a network split over the last few years of bitcoin's scaling debate, but none have panned out so far. In recent weeks, action has increased, though, with groups starting to form around two scaling proposals, SegWit2x and BIP 148. Each hopes to usher in a code change known as Segregated Witness (SegWit) in a different way. But, each also has a risk of splitting bitcoin into two assets and impacting the value of the network and its users. (Although, as of this morning, it looks like the two proposals might be made compatible.) As such, the proposals have been highly politicized, creating market uncertainty and confusion that has arguably exacerbated a diversification by investors into other digital assets. For instance, some have gone as far as to call BIP 148's activation date bitcoin’s ""Independence Day"" since it pushes through a change without requesting miners to signal support for it first. Philosophically, the movement takes the argument that bitcoin's mining was never meant to be so centralized, and that those that contribute resources to securing its ledger weren't meant to have outsized control. But, Bitmain, among others, disagrees that BIP 148's user-activated soft fork (UASF) is the best way to push through upgrades to the cryptocurrency. As have others, the group is citing public safety in its comments. ""BIP148 is very dangerous for exchanges and other business,"" the firm's post reads. Elsewhere, the company has described its plan to hard fork as a way to save users from the consequences of a split once BIP 148 activates. One potential problem with the UASF is what's known as a 'reorganization', where user transactions could later be erased from the blockchain history. This could happen if two chains persist temporarily, but then merge back into one chain, erasing transactions that occurred on the 'losing' chain. The company goes on later to expand on its plan to hard fork (or mine on a different version of bitcoin's blockchain history) in response to the UASF in an effort to make the split more permanent. The statement read: Bitmain said it will kick off the hard fork, which it called a ""User-Activated Hard Fork (UAHF)"", about 12 hours after the UASF starts. Though, the firm plans to mine it privately for three days before it opens to other miners. With each new twist, bitcoin's bitcoin scaling debate is growing more confusing and harder to follow. Moving quickly from proposals as diverse as SegWit, SegWit2x, UASF and now UAHF, the situation so far this year may be too complex to describe in full. In this light, however, some believe the strength of the UAHF proposal is that it moves the market to a kind of certainty. Cornell University computer science associate professor Emin Gün Sirer thinks that it's a good sign, at least in that parties are being ""transparent"" about their future plans. ""The fact that they’re being forthright about it is nice to see. From the perspective of someone who's not on either side [of the debate], this is a welcome development,"" he said, adding: Others have argued similarly, noting that the proposal outlines a way to bake in safety features, including resistance to 'replay attacks' should the network split. (This was a problem in the aftermath of ethereum's split into ethereum and ethereum classic last summer). Bitcoin Unlimited developer David Jerry Chan argued on social media that the change protects the main blockchain from a UASF. Still other observers think that no outcome is likely and that, at the end of the day, neither side will sacrifice the network's accrued value and market leader position for a small technical shift. As usual, though, reactions to the plan were split, generally between those that support volunteer developer group Bitcoin Core’s technical roadmap and those who don't. SatoshiLabs CEO Marek Palatinus, the company behind mining pool Slush Pool, reported that the company has been ""monitoring"" the debate, but ""the situation is getting really foggy"". He argued that he interpreted the blog post to mean that Bitmain will mine a private blockchain that would be governed by the company. He told CoinDesk in an email: Along these lines, Henry Brade, CEO of European cryptocurrency trading platform Prasos, added that he thinks bitcoin users are resistant to the idea of miners controlling the rules of the network. While he believes miners play a ""crucial"" role for bitcoin, he said that Bitmain's new roadmap is a sign that the company is trying to dictate the rules of what is supposed to be a ""decentralized"" online currency. ""It's good that Bitmain released this 'plan' though, because it shows everyone that what they really want is complete control over bitcoin,"" Blockstream CSO Samson Mow said, putting the same idea in a different way. Others, such as pseudonymous developer Alphonse Pace, argued that the hard fork is a ""complete bluff"", adding to the idea that this is merely an escalation of claims. ""They make no details about how much hash power to commit to it. It may be so insignificant that it has virtually no blocks, and they won't even publicly show what they are mining because it probably will be embarrassingly small,"" the developer said. Still, some are taking the event as a sign that the 1st August UASF is working as it's supposed to. Brade, who favors the UASF, told CoinDesk that he's ""very optimistic"" about this turn of events, arguing that Bitmain would ignore the UASF if they thought it would not work. ""It's a sign that Bitmain actually thinks the UASF community plan is legit. They are worried that it's going to happen. Apparently they don’t like it,"" he said. Further, he believes it will further push users towards a UASF, an upgrading mechanism that he favors. He added: Indeed, to some, the appeal of a UASF is that it has more of a psychological effect. Pseudonymous developer Shaolinfry, who popularized the idea of a UASF a couple of months ago, argued that the threat of a UASF is what led mining pools to ultimately support SegWit on litecoin, for example. Further, despite Bitmain arguing that a reorganization is a reason to split off into another chain, others have claimed that safety is the key reason they will upgrade to BIP 148. That way, a user's bitcoins are less likely to disappear in the event of a split. Either way, this uncertainty (to which Sirer alluded) is a reason why some developers argue that bitcoin companies and users should put a pause on bitcoin transactions at around this time to stay safe. For one, while 30 or so firms have pledged support for the UASF, the big players that such an upgrading mechanism is contingent on (eg exchanges like Coinbase and Kraken) have not. After the hard fork, Bitmain also outlined a farther-looking technical plan for the resulting blockchain if its upgrade works as planned. The company said that three bitcoin developer groups are working on the UAHF code, which will be ready by 1st July. Long-term plans are to eventually add the scaling optimization SegWit, an RSK sidechain that would port ethereum-style smart contracts to bitcoin, extension blocks, the scalable protocol Bitcoin-NG and other features. All that said, the company said that it still supports SegWit2x, a recent scaling 'agreement' that boasts the support of most major bitcoin companies and groups that control more than 80% of the mining power. As with the hard fork, response to the roadmap was mixed. For one, some of the included technologies might be incompatible with what developers are working on right now. Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark noted that the technology Lumino is not compatible with Lightning Network. Developers of several different versions of the transaction-boosting software drew up standards last October so that all of them would work together. Still, others are hopeful about the company's long-term roadmap. Sirer said that he wasn't surprised to see that Bitcoin-NG, a potentially more scalable version of the protocol that he co-architected with other researchers at Cornell University, was included. ""It shows that they're not just kicking the can down the road. Instead they have a medium to long-term vision for how to really address the scalability problem,"" he said. Still, there are signs that the debate, despite its diversity of proposals, is getting more and more dictated by emotion. In comments, Haipo Yang, CEO of bitcoin mining pool ViaBTC, for example, continued to voice his support for Bitmain and its proposal on the basis that it might eliminate network congestion and fees. At play, however, is a complexity of underlying ideas and motives. Yang, for instance, believes high fees are forcing away potential users (not showcasing that demand is escalating and growing), that developers are seeking too much control (despite largely still backing the same proposal for months), that users should be able to choose from multiple clients (though they technically can and aren't) and that a split into two networks is better for all involved (though that might affect the value of users' funds). On these issues (and more), there are arguments to take on either side. But, in this jockeying for control, the migration of investor funds into alternative protocols may prove to be adding pressures to what some are calling a 'power struggle'. Finally exasperated by the questioning, Yang concluded: The question now may be whether this market change will force action, and if it does, whether users will be caught in any fallout.

Maria T Vullo, the NYDFS superintendent, said in a statement that the approval was the result of a collaboration between her agency and the Conference of State Bank Supervisors – a nationwide institution that supervises state-chartered financial institutions. Gemini is now operating in most US states, with the exception of Alaska, Arizona, Hawaii, Oregon and Wisconsin. Key to Gemini's permission to serve Washington was its trust charter, granted in New York in 2015.  On application, the exchange's founders, investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, preferred that option to the state's 'BitLicense', arguing it allowed a wider scope of businesses to be served. The exchange was following in the footsteps of itBit (now Paxos) – the first digital currency firm to seek a charter in the state. At the time, the startup made the argument that a charter would enable it to offer services in more states without applying for licenses state by state. The approval comes two months after Washington passed Senate Bill 5031, which requires some digital currency businesses to comply with the state money transmitter laws and exchanges to obtain licenses. The new rules will become effective from 23rd July, 2017. While a small update, the decision has potentially major implications for cryptocurrency startups that may be classed as money services businesses or money transmitters. In response to the passage of the bill, Gemini competitors including Poloniex and Bitfinex announced they would no longer do business with customers residing in Washington.

At press time, bitcoin was down 5.5% across global exchanges, falling to a low of $2,547.18. This figure was down nearly 15% from an all-time high of over $3,000 reached on 11th June, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. This marked the lowest total observed on the BPI since 4th June, when average prices across exchanges fell to $2494.29. Elsewhere, other cryptocurrencies were in the red. The price of ether, ethereum's native cryptocurrency, declined by nearly 10% to reach a low of $361. This was after testing new highs of more than $400 over this past weekend. In the meantime, the top 20 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization according to data service Coinmarketcap almost all fell for an average 7%. Even IOTA, a token for an Internet of Things-specific distributed ledger software was down 15% after a strong market debut yesterday. Bucking this trend, however, was Ripple's XRP token, the third-largest by market capitalization after bitcoin and ethereum, which surged for nearly 10% today. According to data service Coinmarketcap, Korean Won trading contributed to 61.5% of XRP volume with $271m in volume taking place across its three major exchanges.

In a speech Tuesday, first reported by The Register, Australia's opposition leader Bill Shorten suggested that government regulations on bitcoin should be more stringent to mitigate the chance it could be used illicitly by terrorists and cybercriminals. Shorten, who leads the Australian Labor Party argued that as criminals are already seeking to ""obscure their financial deals"", and that digital currencies could become a prime target for exploitation when paired with the anonymity afforded by the dark web. Shorten said: The comments are the latest sign out of Australia that the government is beefing up its efforts to regulate and control encryption services. Earlier this month, both Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and attorney general George Brandis went public with their belief that the pervasive use of encryption is proving problematic for law enforcement. Further, the developments come amidst a wave of new increased attention for the more negative use cases of bitcoin. Following major ransomware attacks, law enforcement discussion now appears more active and critical of the emerging technology. Australia police image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Scaling: How to Give Everyone More Control                        ",Jimmy Song,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-scaling-give-everyone-control/,"Jimmy Song is a bitcoin developer and principal architect at blockchain technology startup Paxos. In this opinion piece, Song discusses bitcoin's scaling debate, arguing that the long-proposed idea of adding sidechains to the digital currency's protocol could ultimately provide the best path forward. Politics has gripped bitcoin – it's about the only thing people have been wanting to talk about for the past few years. I've written before about how the bitcoin ecosystem is like the three branches of government, with developers being the legislative branch, miners serving as the executive branch and users being the judicial branch. I've also written about how bitcoin changes through consensus, and how consensus is not supposed to be easy. In this article, I examine an alternative path to the current political stalemate and how that can help empower developers, miners and users. Among mining manufacturers, it's pretty obvious that Bitmain is the biggest and most successful. They produce somewhere around 50–75% of the bitcoin network hash power through their chips and other manufacturers have a tough time competing with them on price. Their first product, the S1, came out in 2014 when there were many more competitors (CoinTerra, KnCMiner and Spondoolies-Tech to name a few). They distinguished themselves by having the product on hand at various bitcoin conferences and, unlike many of their competitors, having great supply chain management helped them win fans around the world. As bitcoin experienced a three-year bear market, many mining manufacturers simply went out of business as the economics turned from wildly profitable to barely survivable. It didn't help that many had products that often had defects and delivery issues. Bitmain not only survived this time, but thrived, and managed to capture significant market share. Whatever your opinion of the company may be, Bitmain is the most dominant miner and they are the 800-pound gorilla in the mining space. It's well known that Satoshi Nakamoto made the first bitcoin client and released it to the world in 2009. Many people have contributed to what's called the 'reference client' and Bitcoin Core, as it’s now called, has hundreds of developers that contribute to the open-source repository. What's less known is that there have been many different attempts to create alternative bitcoin clients. Obelisk, btc-d, Toshi and bcoin are just some of the many attempts at creating new clients from scratch. Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin XT and the newest Segwit2x are some forks of Bitcoin Core. While each has had a varying degree of success, it appears most of the network continues to run Bitcoin Core (most estimates are well over 90%). Why is Bitcoin Core the most popular? There's certainly history to consider. People managing money tend to be conservative and changing any part of the tool chain for managing money tends to be a dicey proposition as any errors may cause monetary loss. Further, Core has the largest developer community and the most rigorous development processes in place. Whatever your opinion of Bitcoin Core may be, the team continues to produce the dominant client on the network, and they are the 800-pound gorilla in the development space. While before 2014 the miners and developers generally got along, things started to change once the issue of scaling came up. We've now got to the point where the scaling conflict is often seen as Bitmain vs Bitcoin Core (I'm sure neither are happy with that characterization). Either way, we have two dominant groups that have been in conflict. Miners are frustrated because they've been asking for large blocks for years. From Bitmain's perspective, none of the developers seem even interested in any sort of hard fork. When they ask, the usual responses range from ""Follow the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal process"" (which inevitably gets voted down) to ""Fork off"". Developers are frustrated because they've been asking for SegWit for years. From Bitcoin Core's perspective, the miners seem to be obstructing good technology for no good reason. When they ask for a reason, the usual responses range from ""We want larger blocks"" to ""You're carrying water for Blockstream"". Generally, when there's a conflict that's not getting resolved, you have to go up a level of abstraction to figure out the problem. While scaling is the reason everyone claims for this conflict, the actual reason may lie higher up. And when you think about the actual consensus process that's required to change bitcoin, it's clear that both sides want more control than they currently have. And this makes sense. Both groups are interested in more say over the long haul as bitcoin becomes more and more valuable. A small concession or precedent set now has consequences going forward. Bitcoin Core may be thinking a hard fork now would set a precedent for additional, possibly more dangerous, hard forks later. Bitmain may be thinking cooperation on a soft fork without getting some concession would set a precedent for being dominated and having requests ignored later. Bitcoin Unlimited in this context can be seen as a way to get around the developers by replacing them entirely. Similarly, BIP 148 and other UASF proposals are a way to get around the miners. This has brought us to the current impasse. Both sides want control, but given that bitcoin is a consensus-based system, there's no way to give each side what it wants and keep bitcoin on a single chain. The way to solve this problem, then, is not by trying to solve the presenting technical issue, but by solving the deeper issue of control. The question isn’t so much ""How can we scale bitcoin?"" but ""How can we give each side more control?"". The most obvious way to give each side more control would be to split bitcoin in two, or what I would call the 'Solomon solution'. We can hard fork bitcoin and each side can do whatever it wants on their chain. One side would have to find new miners (or even a new proof-of-work function) and the other side would have to find new developers. While this has some appeal, splitting bitcoin in two has the potential to cause significant collateral damage. Indeed, most contentious forks have this as a possible endpoint as both sides have the ability to hard fork. Bitcoin may be the baby that dies if nobody agrees. So far, we've only been talking about two of the three branches of the bitcoin governance: miners and developers. When the two disagree, the ideal solution would be to have the users adjudicate. Unfortunately, safe, liquid adjudication is only available after a hard fork when the price between the tokens can float. But what if we can give both miners and developers control over separate, smaller domains? What if each could run separate chains and each could change and use them according to their needs and desires? Further, what if these separate chains were actually extensions of bitcoin itself? Wouldn't users naturally utilize the one that they preferred? Wouldn't the best idea win instead of the best political player? If this sounds familiar, it should. This is what the whole sidechains project is all about. If you haven’t heard about sidechains, think of them as a separate blockchain where you can deposit and withdraw bitcoins. That is, if you deposit 1 BTC to the sidechain, you add 1 BTC to your balance on the sidechain. The same goes for withdrawals – it's all done on the sidechain. The separate blockchain can have all sorts of new features and won't actually affect bitcoin. And this is the key. You can give control of one sidechain to the miners and another to the developers. In fact, you can add lots more sidechains for a variety of purposes to see how well they work. Users can vote with their feet by going to sidechains that they find most useful. Merchants, for example, may want to go to a sidechain that's much quicker to confirm. Exchanges may want to go to a sidechain with more financial instruments available. That sounds awesome! Why don’t we have it yet? Good question. One sidechain implementation already works. The sidechain is called Liquid and has been developed by Blockstream. The startup utilizes something called a 'federation', which is a fancy way of saying deposits to the sidechain are bitcoins sent to multisig addresses. The Liquid security model requires a bunch (11+) of known, trusted entities (like exchanges) and that's still in the process of being set up. The good news with Liquid is that it requires no changes to the bitcoin protocol in order to work. The bad news is that you have to trust that a majority of entities won't steal from you. The other sidechain implementation is something called Drivechains. The good news is that Drivechains don't require (less) trusted entities and the code is almost done. The bad news is that Drivechains require a soft fork. Wouldn't this give everybody what they want? It certainly seems so. Having the market decide instead of committees seems like a much more scalable solution (pun intended). And indeed Paul Sztorc [economist at Bloq] has proposed Drivechains as an alternative to SegWit or 2MB blocks. Segwit can easily be deployed on one sidechain and larger blocks on another. It's not all good news, however. There's the obvious fact that BIP 148 and BUIP 0055 are scheduled for 1st August and 18th October, respectively. Both are potentially contentious forks and may very well cause some serious disruption. Liquid requires finding enough trusted entities in enough jurisdictions. Many users don't like having to trust other entities, so this may be a non-starter. Drivechains requires a soft fork where miners validate new rules. Further, there are some technical issues that may need to be addressed, as well as code that needs extensive review and testing before a soft fork can happen. Developers and miners would ultimately have to agree to pursue this path. The benefits of a sidechain solution are pretty clear. Developers and miners are empowered because they can try out new, riskier features on sidechains and don't have to get anyone's approval for doing so. Each can control their own sidechain without disrupting any other part of bitcoin. Users are empowered since they can have a choice of features without having to leave bitcoin. The downsides of a sidechain solution are a bit murkier and require a more thorough examination of the incentives to really evaluate properly. As bitcoin enters its fourth year of scaling conflict, creative solutions like Drivechains and Liquid deserve more rigorous consideration. There very well may be technical or trust issues that are insurmountable, but it's vital that, as a community, we leave no stone unturned. We are currently embroiled in a bitter political war. This is because we're essentially stuck in a zero-sum game of consensus building. Innovation is a better way to resolve conflict than politics. Politics is messy, divisive and harmful. Innovation is clean, unifying and constructive. If an innovative path can be found, we owe it to ourselves as a community to find it.

                            BIP 148 + SegWit2x? A Bitcoin Scaling Compromise Might Not Be So Easy                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bip-148-segwit2x-bitcoin-scaling-compromise-might-not-easy/,"Could two of bitcoin's more polarizing scaling proposals unite? As demand for alternative blockchain assets continues to grow, some technologists are starting to wonder if a more collaborative means of solving one of the network's long-perceived problems could be achieved. The idea is that two of the better-known scaling proposals, SegWit2x and BIP 148, might be equipped to work together given that both are attempting to upgrade the network with Segregated Witness (SegWit), a network optimization first proposed by developers in 2015. Yet, each project is currently paving the way for a scaling optimization differently, and in ways that are ultimately incompatible with the other. BIP 148, for example, is moving ahead with its user-activated soft fork (UASF) that would seek to push SegWit live without explicitly asking miners for support. SegWit2x, meanwhile, plans to pair SegWit with a 2 MB block-size increase, boosting transaction capacity further by tweaking the bitcoin's underlying rules. And that collision could lead to a split – one that turns bitcoin into two competing assets. Adding to the drama is that the upgrades are set to take their next steps at around the same time. If all goes according to plan, users will be able to begin running SegWit2x on 21st July. Likewise, BIP 148 will be triggered on 1st August, an event some are calling ""Bitcoin Independence Day"". Yet, because of the incompatibility between the two proposals, those that begin running SegWit2x could end up on an entirely different bitcoin network than those running BIP 148, with entirely different bitcoins trading at an entirely different value. So, how likely is this more adversarial scenario? Advocates of BIP 148 are saying their proposal is going to activate no matter what. Since people are already running the code for the bitcoin improvement protocol, there's no way to alter it or put it back in 'Pandora’s box'. So, with that in mind, several developers have argued that SegWit2x should adopt BIP 148 to avoid a split. John Light, who works with bitcoin payment startup Abra, is one of those advocates, contending in a recent blog post that ""BIP 148 does not violate the spirit of the [SegWit2x] agreement, since it both activates SegWit and in no way prevents signatories from running code for a 2MB hard fork once it’s ready"". The idea is that, if the goal is activating SegWit, then why not join forces rather than risk a split? Light told CoinDesk: But, there are other ideas for keeping the network from splitting up. Bitcoin developer James Hilliard recently proposed 'split protection' that requires less miner support for SegWit than past proposals. Effectively, if a majority of miners run it a split would be avoided. ""I think split protection could be the closest we get to a 'golden ticket' to maximize compatibility between BIP 148 and Segwit2x,"" Reddit moderator BashCo said, echoing the sentiments of some other bitcoin developers. BashCo could be right, but it's hard to say what will happen given that there's some resistance to BIP 148 in the bitcoin community. When asked whether SegWit2x would be compatible with BIP 148, Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik, one of the developers who's been leading the charge to SegWit2x, didn't suggest this was a top priority. Garzik told CoinDesk: 'Scope creep' seems to have already become a problem for the project. On its GitHub pages, Garzik has waved off various requests for a variety of extra features given the short time frame he was assigned for the project. Still, he has been open to feedback – seemingly in favor of incorporating another proposal, BIP 91 (from Hilliard), aimed at ensuring that SegWit2x's implementation is compatible with the estimated 83% of bitcoin nodes that are already running the version of SegWit that was deployed last November. Plus, SegWit2x is an open-source project, meaning it relies on input from volunteers. The alpha version will be released this week, on 16th June, at which point outside developers can leave additional feedback. Adding to all the complexity here is that each proposal on its own might result in some users forking off onto their own network. If a majority of mining pools don't flag support for SegWit, BIP 148 will lead to the creation of two separate bitcoin assets. Meanwhile, if users decide not to upgrade to 2MB, SegWit2x will lead to a split as well. Now, more than ever, there seem to be more efforts that could lead to splits, which is one reason why this current group of proposals have vehement detractors. Still, while the thought of a split is worrisome to many stakeholders, bitcoin’s scaling debate has seen plenty of false alarms. In the past, other developers and users have suggested they would like to split off from bitcoin, but none, so far, have actually followed through. Blockstream chief strategy officer Samson Mow, for one, doesn't think it's possible to mandate that all users uphold the hard fork portion of the SegWit2x agreement – the part that could lead to a split. Other developers have argued that it's impossible to mandate that everyone switch to the 2MB version at a technical level. Because of these technical complications, some in the community doubt that the companies that signed on to the SegWit2x proposal will see through with making the 2MB upgrade. ""Basically it's a promise that can't and won't be kept,"" Mow argued. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which helped organize the SegWit2x proposal.

Branded 'The Flippening' by market observers, this new hypothetical is defined loosely as the point at which a competing blockchain network could replace bitcoin as the largest and best capitalized blockchain. Sparked by increasing inflows in cryptographic assets, the concept has already seen a dedicated hashtag and website. Given that bitcoin invented and popularized blockchain systems, the development could herald a time of new diversity and experimentation for the nascent sector that, until recently, was largely defined in context of bitcoin. At earlier points in 2017, bitcoin accounted for more than 80% of the total cryptocurrency market share, though this figure has been higher than 90% at times. However, so-called alternative cryptocurrencies have drawn robust inflows this year, causing their total market cap to reach a record high of roughly $117bn today, a more than 500% year-to-date increase, according to CoinMarketCap.  So, will the event come to pass? And if so, what will it mean? Analysts queried by CoinDesk largely believe ethereum's ether token is most likely to spur the change, given it has increased 3,000% this year with no signs of slowing. Indeed, ether's market cap has been drawing steadily close to bitcoin's amid a broader uptick in interest for so-called 'tokens' based on the platform, with the two cryptocurrencies worth $35.9bn and $43.7bn at the time of report.  Still, while some analysts focused on the promise of the ethereum network, others emphasized the perceived difficulties bitcoin has encountered of late as the reason this development could be likely. Developers and entrepreneurs building on bitcoin are still trying to figure out the best way to resolve its ongoing scaling dilemma, a matter which some allege is limiting the cryptocurrency's use as a medium of exchange. (Though, perhaps benefitting its use as a store of value). Currently, blocks in bitcoin's blockchain can only include up to 1 MB of transaction date, meaning that they can only process a fixed number of exchanges. Thus far, proposals to increase the block size have failed, and efforts to implement Segregated Witness – a solution that would reduce the total size of each individual transaction and allow more of these to fit into blocks – have failed to gain the needed support. Other proposals have largely proved short-lived or polarizing. ""Bitcoin is still stuck at [the] scaling dilemma,"" said Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool. ""If some kind of agreement were achieved, [bitcoin] could regain much of its dominance."" However, the bitcoin community has not yet found a solution, so ether is benefiting from the situation, he said. As markets respond to these developments, Rupsys expects ether's market capitalization, or the total value of its available token supply, to surpass bitcoin's. Bitcoin, the first cryptocurrency to scale, has to an extent become ""a victim of its own success,"" said Tim Enneking, managing director of the cryptocurrency hedge fund Crypto Asset Fund. He also noted that ether has benefited from coming into existence after bitcoin, telling CoinDesk: Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange service CryptoCompare, was also optimistic that ethereum could become the dominant blockchain. ""Ether has a strong chance of surpassing bitcoin due to its strong network effect and ability to negate the governance issues that bitcoin has been subject to,"" he said. Some market observers emphasized the key role played by token sales (or ICOs) when explaining why ether's market cap might surpass that of bitcoin's. As these offerings allow participants to exchange bitcoin and ether for digital 'tokens' that grant exposure to new ventures, investors purchasing these tokens (contracts on the ethereum network) frequently use ether because they don't want to miss out. Further, the concentration of ether in the hands of a smaller set of startups is creating new economic pressures on the network. ""This keeps many ethers locked up in new projects and [fewer] ethers are available for trading,"" Rupsys noted. Bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem offered a similar sentiment, noting: ""Right now, an immense supply of ETH gets locked up due to [ICOs]."" This ""severely reduces supply,"" and with each offering, more tokens are ""locked up"", he explained. Still, projects using this method of fundraising are going to sell some of the ether tokens they raise to pay for development, he said, meaning sell pressure could increase should this begin in earnest. While many analysts provided optimistic assessments of ether's future, some expressed concerns that the cryptocurrency is in bubble territory. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency platform Whaleclub, asserted that ether's price is tied heavily to the ICOs that use the alternative asset protocol. ""I personally think ether price is incredibly overpriced, and that many of the ICOs funded will not deliver on all their promises. When that unravels, it's likely to cause a substantial crash in the ether price,"" he said. However, he did leave open the possibility that ether's market cap could surpass bitcoin's, depending on how much success ether-based ICOs produce. Still, analysts also emphasized the influence both networks could have on the world. While bitcoin could revolutionize the world of currency, ether could have more a wide-ranging influence through its use of smart contracts. Mati Greenspan, senior markets analyst at asset trading platform eToro, spoke to this potential. He added that, given its expansive goals, it might be likely for ether to surpass bitcoin in terms of market cap, though it may not have the largest network effect by other means.

                            Bitcoin Drops $300 in One Hour as Price Falls Abruptly and Rebounds                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-drops-300-one-hour-price-falls-abruptly-rebounds/," The price of bitcoin may have just topped $3,000 for the first time, but that doesn't mean the digital asset is leaving its historical volatility behind. At roughly 10:00 UTC this morning, bitcoin prices fell abruptly, dropping more than $300 in a span of minutes from $2,980 to a daily low of $2,650. The more than $300 decline came just hours after bitcoin climbed to a new high of $3,000 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, a weighted average of prices across major exchanges. But while precipitous, the decline was short-lived, with prices returning to just under $2,900 a half hour later on the BPI. According to analysts, early indications are the price capitulation could herald that the bitcoin price has diverged too far from fundamentals. ""It is just standard technical divergences – we made a higher high on less volume and waning momentum,"" BTC VIX, organizer of the bitcoin trading forum Whale Club, told CoinDesk. ""[This could] signal a weakening trend."" Indeed, the decline coincided with the closure of millions of dollars in long positions on OKCoin, one of the major leveraged bitcoin exchanges, a development that likely exacerbated the decline. All in all, however, the price of bitcoin has been surging of late. Though today's decline could give investors caution, bitcoin has risen more than $1,000 over the last 30 days as investor interest in cryptocurrencies continues to increase amid a period of robust gains for the asset class.

                            Bitcoin, Ethereum and a New Direction for Cryptocurrency Investment                        ",Noelle Acheson,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-ethereum-and-a-new-direction-for-cryptocurrency-investment/,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis and corporate finance, and a member of CoinDesk's product team. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers. This week CoinDesk released its State of Blockchain Q1 2017 study, which details recent trends, statistics and sentiment around cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. While the entire report is worth a read (there are some surprises), two slides especially caught my attention. When put together and compared with current data, they point to what could be a fundamental shift in market dynamics. The first one is slide 62:  Ninety-four percent of respondents to our 'Bitcoin and Ethereum Sentiment Survey' indicated that they were positive on the outlook for ethereum – almost three times as many as for bitcoin. The main reasons for the disillusionment with bitcoin appear to be the high fees, the increasing centralization and the outlook for scaling. Interestingly, this has not slowed down the increase in the bitcoin price, which has climbed 160% since the end of Q1. It does, however, point to a growing interest in ethereum as an investment vehicle. The price of the platform's ether token has increased by 420% in the same period. Now, take a look at this chart from slide 47:  This shows that ether purchases in Q1 were largely in bitcoin. Now, why would investors give up bitcoin to buy into ethereum? Either they believe that bitcoin will soon start heading down – slide 62 shows that almost 45% of respondents are negative on the cryptocurrency – or that it could continue to go up, but that ethereum will increase by even more. Either way, we’re looking at an asset reallocation. If you take a look at the ether trading volumes today, though, you see a different picture. The volume of fiat purchases of ether has shot past that of bitcoin to account for approximately 70% of volume (at time of writing). A large part of that growth is due to a jump in interest from South Korea, but US dollar purchases have also increased significantly. This looks like ‘new money’ is coming into cryptocurrencies and choosing ethereum over other alternatives. Bitcoin’s trading volume is also increasing (and still dwarfs that of ethereum), but not by as much. What could this mean? While trading data of a few weeks does not necessarily translate to new market trends, it could hint at a shift in portfolio prominence. While bitcoin has traditionally been the main cryptocurrency holding for both private and institutional portfolios, ether is emerging as a strong contender. One interesting effect from this will most likely be a change in the conversation. It should move from the 'bitcoin isn't money' diatribe, to one of 'what can ethereum do?'. Although over 85% of our survey respondents felt that ether could serve as a currency as well as bitcoin could, it has never worn the currency cloak like bitcoin has. Ether has traditionally been positioned more as a ‘digital token’ that can engage with scripts and contracts, and can be used to enable apps across a wide range of sectors. From an asset allocation and a sentiment perspective, ether’s rise in prominence is encouraging. A shift in focus from threat to innovation would be more constructive for all, and should push development in the cryptocurrency sector even further. Directions signpost image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Price Crosses $3,000 Milestone to Set New All-Time High                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-crosses-3000-milestone-set-new-time-high/," The price of bitcoin topped $3,000 for the first time in history today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). After spending much of the last week seeking direction in the $2,700 to $2,900-range, the average price of bitcoin across major international exchanges edged up over this threshold finally at roughly 17:00 UTC. The new record comes at a time when alternative digital assets are seeing robust inflows, with ethereum's ether token setting a new all-time high of more than $300 today as well. Indeed, analysts spoke to the ongoing broadening of the cryptocurrency market as a tide that is benefitting bitcoin. ""The inflows into 'alts' are greater than those into bitcoin. In other words, bitcoin is growing at a very nice pace, but non-bitcoin cryptocurrencies are growing even faster,"" cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Tim Enneking told CoinDesk. Jehan Chu, managing partner at cryptocurrency fund Jen Advisors, agreed, noting that bitcoin is likely benefitting from new investor interest and the surging interest of ""cryptos like ether"". Still, Arthur Hayes, founder of Hong Kong-based digital currency exchange BitMEX, stated that bitcoin is still the ""most talked-about cryptocurrency"", even as returns become more substantial in other areas of the market. Hayes told CoinDesk: Investor Sean Walsh largely agreed, pointing to bitcoin's growing price as a sign of its place in the market as the first stop on a road to other assets. ""Bitcoin still seems like the dominant gateway to [alternative digital assets]. So, many first purchase bitcoin in order to then trade their bitcoin for altcoins,"" he noted. The development coincides with signs that the cryptocurrency market is maturing to support new inflows and increasing interest. As noted by CoinDesk research analyst Alex Sunnarborg today, the cryptocurrency exchange market has never been more globally diverse or buoyed by such an array of possible inflows. Such tailwinds have combined in recent weeks to bring new investor attention to bitcoin, with expectations for bitcoin's growth becoming more and more exuberant. Danish investment firm Saxo Bank went so far as to publish a forecasting report in which it placed the possible value of bitcoin at $100,000 in the next 10 years.

                            Headwinds or Tailwinds? How US Tax Reform Could Impact Bitcoin's Price                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/headwinds-tailwinds-us-tax-reform-impact-bitcoins-price/,"Since its inception in 2009, the price of bitcoin has risen sharply, climbing from zero to more than $2,900 earlier this month. However, the cryptocurrency has experienced this appreciation during a time of low interest rates and meager yields, a situation that could change in the coming years. This period of ultra-low yields has lowered the opportunity cost associated with investing in bitcoin. While bitcoin's price has thrived in this environment, investors could find the cryptocurrency less attractive if interest rates and yields push higher. Should yields, including dividend payments (regular payments made to stockholders for being owners of a company) increase, it could produce one more headwind for bitcoin's price by making dividend-paying stocks more appealing than the cryptocurrency. And all this seems to align with other challenges, such as the scaling issue, that the protocol is facing, which could also put downward pressure on the cryptocurrency's price. According to some analysts, this increase in dividend payments is right around the corner. And the increase is likely to eclipse the S&P 500 Index's dividend yield (which measures a company's dividend payments relative to its stock price), which for the last decade has remained below 3%. One of the reasons dividend payments could increase is because of the momentum to reform corporate income tax. If reform happens, lawmakers would be giving businesses fatter coffers, making it easier for them to reward investors through larger dividend payments. Notably, US Republicans have proposed a major overhaul of corporate income tax, which would cut the rate to 15%. This reform could significantly bolster the financial resources of companies, making it easier for them to hike dividend payments, again, making these types of investments more lucrative than bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Furthermore, President Donald Trump has made lowering the corporate income tax rate – which is currently the highest of any Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development nation at 35% – a key part of his tax policy initiatives. Currently, both the House and Senate have Republican majorities, which might give him a better chance of successfully enacting the proposals. ""The likelihood of something getting passed this year is high,"" said Eric Ervin, president and CEO of Reality Shares, which focuses on dividend investing. While ""the timing is uncertain ... we have the right legislature and presidency"" to get tax cuts passed, he asserted. While, many of bitcoin's libertarian-leaning supporters (whose mantra is commonly ""taxation is theft"") might see tax cuts in a positive light, for bitcoin's price, these cuts could be unfavorable. A second tax reform proposed by Republicans would allow global companies to repatriate – or bring home – foreign earnings at a tax rate of 10%, far lower than the current rate. According to FactSet data, during the 12 months through Q3 2016, S&P 500 companies paid out roughly $431bn-worth of dividends. This figure could increase sharply if companies can repatriate more of their foreign earnings. Reality Share's Ervin said: Effectively, companies that historically parked their money in countries with lower tax rates could bring that money back home and use it to pay out higher dividends, making investors less likely to put their money in bitcoin. Anthony Parent, the founding partner at law firm, Parent and Parent LLP, agreed with that sentiment. With more foreign funds available, companies will increase dividends right away, he said, which is likely to have a negative impact on bitcoin's price. However, bitcoin could come out of this unscathed. Kevin Quigg, chief strategist for investment manager ACSI Funds, said he doesn't expect the bolstering of company dividends to be the ""primary result"" of overhauling corporate tax. Quigg continued: But instead of increasing dividends, companies might use the additional resources to hire new workers, purchase new equipment or find new capital. As a result, it remains uncertain whether the bitcoin price would significantly suffer from tax reforms. Not only that, but reforms might be easier said than done in a combative Washington, DC, environment. Quigg told CoinDesk: And without these dividend-bolstering tax reforms, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will continue to shine in the low interest rate and yield environment. Such developments, it should be noted, would only impact one country as well, and bitcoin is seeing robust inflows from China and Japan in recent months. All in all, should lawmakers fail to pass the tax overhauls, it could provide tailwinds for bitcoin – which has frequently been seen as a safe haven asset for those concerned about macroeconomic turmoil.

The man who in large part built his reputation based on what are widely considered accurate predictions based on historical data, talked about the power he believes cryptocurrencies have to cross borders and maybe replace national currencies. But, he expressed skepticism that bitcoin would be that replacement. Addressing an audience of 700 senior executives, technologists and more, at the Exponential Finance event hosted by Singularity University, which he co-founded, Kurzweil explained his doubts. While he described ""assumptions"" about bitcoin’s ability to scale as ""quite accurate"" he said that people won’t be looking at algorithms to make their spending decisions. Instead he argued that it was the historic stability of a currency that makes it valuable, stability he said has been lacking in bitcoin. Kurzweil said: In the past year bitcoin’s price has increased from about $580 to almost $3,000. In February, the cryptocurrency surpassed a three-year old record of $1,165, only to regularly experience drops in price in excess of $100 in an hour and hundreds of dollars in a day. According to Kurzweil, who has developed a reputation as a ""futurist"" for his uncanny predictions, such inconsistency undermines the cryptocurrency’s value as a currency. ""I wouldn’t put my money into it,"" he said. In spite of Kurzweil’s skepticism of bitcoin as a currency, he also expressed interest in the possibility that the blockchain technology that powers bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies could eventually be adopted by national governments. He called the ""theory"" behind blockchain ""sound"" but said that ""people don’t yet have confidence in it."" While bitcoin’s ability to store value and facilitate transactions across borders has developed a loyal following among a relatively small group of people, Kurzweil said that wider adoption won’t rely on the power of its algorithm, but its historic reliability. ""There’s no reason why currencies should be associated with particular national boundaries and governments,"" he said. ""However, currencies like the dollar have provided reasonable stability, bitcoin has not."" However, even as Kurzweil expressed his doubts about cryptocurrency as it currently exists, he argued that the promise of ""greater transparency"" and control over the creation process behind cryptocurrency could eventually lead a re-imagining of the way countries mint their native currencies.

A key aspect of the regulations will be a mandate for identification of digital currency, said Alexei Moiseev, the Deputy Finance Minister. ""If you want to buy any financial product, you need to show passport, fill out a contract, write that you are not an American taxpayer. The same should apply here,"" Moiseev added.

Coming yesterday during a hearing held by a subcommittee within the US House of Representatives, the calls followed a notable string of ransomware attacks that have seen consumer data held hostage in exchange for bitcoin payments. The situation has also seen politicians taking a renewed interest in the more negative aspects of cryptocurrency technology in response. Yet, the core problem, panelists told the committee members, is not in bitcoin purchases, it's that when criminals do use bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies for illicit purposes, they often go through exchanges hosted outside the US. In statements, panelists sought to portray these businesses as unlicensed, unregulated and unwilling to abide by basic anti-money laundering and know-your-customer regulations, rules that digital currency exchanges in the US and Western Europe must abide by. ""Nearly 100% of ransomware campaigns cash out through platforms such as these. It's a huge problem,"" said Kathryn Haun, a former Assistant US Attorney and now a lecturer at Stanford University. ""Not surprisingly, the bad actors are not using the Coinbases of the world."" Elsewhere, the hearing examined the use of cryptocurrencies to finance criminal activities such as terrorism, money laundering and cybercrime, all of which fall under the House Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee's mandate to explore the national security implications of new financial innovations. Perhaps unsurprisingly against this backdrop, committee members expressed concern that nefarious activity is becoming more common, while remaining largely outside the reach of authorities. ""The reality is criminals today use cash, money service businesses and other means for illicit purposes, but we've provided law enforcement the regulatory tools to catch the bad guys,"" said Representative Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, the top Democrat on the committee. He told attendees: Tracking down criminals and funds through unregulated overseas exchanges, however, is a difficult proposition for US law enforcement, as even the pettiest of criminals can find ways to obscure their identity. Complicating matters, these businesses can frequently obtain implicit or explicit political protection from US authorities in certain jurisdictions, panelists said. ""Criminals can open anonymous accounts, or accounts with phony names to fly under the radar of law enforcement,"" Haun said. ""Thus, we have received 'Mickey Mouse' who resides at '123 Main Street' in subpoena returns."" If Congress and regulators are serious about tackling the national security implications of digital currencies, taking on these kinds of exchanges is a good place to start, emphasized Scott Dueweke, president of The Identity and Payments Association. Dueweke said: While bitcoin has had its share of nefarious uses, the panelists emphasized that this dynamic is hardly a historical anomaly in technology. ""Early misuse is a fact of life with many emerging technologies, and cryptocurrency is no exception,"" said Stanford's Haun, who is also a member of cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase's board of directors. ""We often say that any technology worth adopting is adopted first by bad actors."" Further, the nature and frequency of the illicit activity actually being financed by digital currencies differs from the current general perception. Jerry Brito, executive director of non-profit advocacy group Coin Center, cited a recent report from the Center for a New American Security, which concluded that only anecdotal evidence exists to support the suggestion that terrorist groups are financing operations through the use of digital currencies. Jonathan Levin, co-founder of Chainalysis, seconded that point, adding that only one verifiable public case of crowdfunding by a known terrorist organization has occurred, and that this campaign raised a meager $1,000. While it is certainly plausible that such activity could become more common, Brito said, there is little reason to justify a crackdown that might quash the technology's advancement: Haun added that the more immediate misuse is occurring in the areas of cybercrime, money laundering and financial fraud. ""These activities have major national security implications,"" she said. Still, while digital currencies do offer criminals a fresh way of financing themselves and procuring services, they also provide authorities with powerful new analytical and tracking tools for following the movement of funds. As such, participants in the panel portrayed bitcoin's underlying blockchain technology as a potential solution to issues caused by bitcoin, the technology that invented and popularized this unique union of digital innovations. ""Bitcoin is thought to be anonymous by some criminals, in reality it's far from anonymous, and companies like Elliptic have assisted law enforcement and private industry to identify who is behind illicit bitcoin transactions,” said Luke Wilson, vice president of business development at the startup. Haun went so far as to recall her experience using transactions on a blockchain ledger to investigate and prosecute a rogue federal agent who had been working with Silk Road, an online dark market shut down by authorities in 2013. She said: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of DCG, which has an ownership stake in Chainalysis, Coinbase and Elliptic. Hearing image via Aaron Stanley for CoinDesk

According to the US Attorney’s Office in the District of Maryland, the two individuals, James Stewart and Vincent Grant, were indicted for using bitcoins to purchase stolen credit and debit card numbers of individuals and businesses from foreign websites. The two were first prosecuted last year, as previously reported by CoinDesk. The defendants were accused of using magnetic strip re-encoding tools to apply stolen numbers to dummy cards, after which they would buy merchandise from Army and Air Force Exchange Service stores at US military bases, as well as other locations in Maryland and elsewhere. The federal jury found Stewart guilty on charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and aggravated identity theft. Grant was also convicted for conspiracy to commit access device fraud and aggravated identity theft. A total of five Army National Guard members were arrested and charged. Of the other three in the case, Derrick Shelton and Quentin Stewart previously pleaded guilty for committing wire fraud and aggravated identity theft, while Jamal Moody pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit access device fraud and aggravated identity theft. Shelton and James and Quentin Stewart face a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison, while Grant and Moody are subject to a maximum seven-and-half year sentence. A mandatory minimum of two years in prison for aggravated identity theft, on top of any other sentence, also apply to all five involved. US Army image via Shutterstock

In a statement, Nicholas Sarwark, who serves as chairman of the Libertarian National Committee, blasted the government's case against Randall Lord, who, along with his son Michael, was sentenced to a prison term late last month following an investigation into their alleged exchange activities. As CoinDesk reported on 30th May, Randall and Michael Lord were sentenced to prison terms of 46 and 106 months, respectively. Both were charged with running an unlawful money transmission, while Michael Lord was also charged with conspiracy to distribute narcotics. Sawark said the Libertarian Party ""vigorously condemns"" the case against Randall Lord, who previously ran as a Libertarian for a House of Representatives seat in Louisiana during elections in 2012 and 2014. He argued: Sawark, in his statement, later took aim at the broader political system. ""The problem is overspending by federal politicians, their manipulation and regulation of currencies, and grandstanding prosecutors who get rewarded for convicting people rather than for achieving justice,"" he said. He called for the sentencing to be overturned, asking supporters to “add your voice to ours in demanding freedom for Randall Lord”. Lord's sentencing was a recent example of a trend of cases against bitcoin traders in the US. Similar cases have been pursued against traders in Michigan, New York and Arizona, among other states.

According to a source quoted by Caixin, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) investigations into the exchange ecosystem are complete, with regulations set to be put forward sometime in June. The news, from 10th May, came just before China’s bitcoin exchange sector began processing digital currency withdrawals following a months-long freeze. That pause began following meetings between regulators in China and domestic exchange operators earlier this year. Investigators reportedly drew issue with the fact that the platforms were providing financing and margin trading services to clients, according to Caixin, while further faulting the exchanges for their anti-money laundering systems. The withdrawal freezes from earlier this year were initiated as those markets moved to update those systems. According to statements made previously by Xuedong Zhou, director of PBoC’s business management department, regulators are likely to ban the exchanges from providing leveraged trading, financing, and margin trading services. He also said that exchanges should not try to pump up the trading volume through waiving transaction fees. Chinese regulators are also discussing possible regulations on initial coin offerings, or ICOs, according to a report review written by Yao Qian, director of PBoC’s digital currencies research department. He wrote in May: In the same review, he suggested that Chinese regulators to speed up the legislation for ICO regulations and to use a sandbox model. Yao also discussed several plans including establishing ICO platforms like crowdfunding platforms, which will be responsible for educating the investors, reviewing ICO initiatives, disclosure of information, and anti-money laundering. Another model he discussed is adapting a venture capital management style and let professionals make the investment decisions.

                            Charts: Bitcoin's Network is Objectively More Congested Than Ever                        ",Alex Sunnarborg,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-network-congestion-in-3-charts-transactions-blocks-fees/,"This article highlights findings from CoinDesk Research's new Q1 2017 State of Blockchain report, focusing on data around the growth of bitcoin's blockchain.  Click here to view the slides in your browser. Born from math, bitcoin is a game of numbers. Transactions have a size of ~500 bytes, blocks are limited to 1 MB and blocks can only be published after a puzzle is solved, a process that occurs via algorithm once every ~10 minutes. The facts that underlie the current bitcoin protocol, set years before transactions could ever be called 'expensive', set the stage for the 'scaling debate' we've watched unfold ever since. Proposals have since developed to decrease transaction sizes, remove the block size limit and move transactions off of the main bitcoin blockchain, all in the name of boosting capacity. Amid this indecision, the network itself has adapted. As bitcoin miners can control the transactions they include in proposed blocks, and users can pay to have their transactions included, a fee market has developed to incentivize the inclusion of transactions into blocks. Still, opinions on scaling solutions and alternate cryptocurrencies aside, objective data from the Q1 2017 tells a different story. Transaction numbers, block sizes and transaction fees on the bitcoin blockchain each reached all-time highs in the first quarter of 2017, proving the demand to use the network is now larger than ever. Here's a closer look at the situation in three charts:  Transactions on the bitcoin network have grown consistently since inception, and over 40% since a year ago. Future growth however is limited due to bitcoin's current block size maximum and transaction size minimum, leading to a ceiling on the number of new transactions that can be added to its blockchain per day, one that bitcoin has now nearly reached.  Blocks have logically followed transactions to within bytes of their maximum capacity. The pace has continued to increase as the year has progressed, and last month the daily average block size did not drop below 0.95 MB, leaving little to no room for transactions without considerable fees for miners.  One of the aspects of the current state of bitcoin most dear to the community and the experience of any future user is transaction fees. Not too many years ago, transactions on the bitcoin network were called 'free' or 'near free' and paying a fee was truly seen as optional. In the first quarter of 2017, however, average transaction fees grew 155% to $0.62, and began to rise at an increasing pace at quarter end. On 7th June, fees averaged over $5.00. Without a doubt, the bitcoin network is now more congested than ever. Transaction numbers and block sizes are up against their limits and fees have reached unprecedented levels. As such, some of the major proposals are making an effort to mitigate user cost. Others argue that this is a sign of health and interest in the network. While it's too soon to know which vision for the network will play out, the support, execution and timing of any action will markedly effect the future of transaction numbers, fees, decentralization, user growth, alternative blockchains and the entire industry.

                            Bitcoin's 'Independence Day': Could Users Tip the Scales in the Scaling Debate?                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-independence-day-could-users-tip-the-scales-in-the-scaling-debate/,"""V for Vendetta"" GIFs, ""Walking Dead"" references, images of tornadoes – even bitcoin's infamous 'BearWhale' has returned to welcome an approaching attempt to upgrade bitcoin. While there have been many efforts aimed at improving the digital currency's protocol in recent years, few have attracted as fervent a following as bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 148. Drafted in an effort to rally the community behind a process called a user-activated soft fork (UASF), the proposal is distinguished by being less reliant on gaining support from network miners. In fact, BIP 148 is the UASF with the shortest timeline to launch – and it's activating on the 1st August. While some reject the growing support for BIP 148 as a kind of populist uprising, others believe it will lead to users having better control over the direction of the protocol. As per usual, opinions are split. Because the change aims to circumvent what some consider a decision by miners not to signal support for Segregated Witness, a scaling solution preferred by Bitcoin Core developers, some have dubbed the upgrade date 'Bitcoin Independence Day'. Alphonse Pace, a developer and supporter of BIP 148, told CoinDesk: So what does BIP 148 actually do? BIP 148 is an atypical UASF in that it tries to encourage users to push miners to upgrade to the version of SegWit that some have been running as part of their bitcoin software since last November. By one measure, more than 80% of bitcoin nodes are now ready for SegWit. BIP 148's rules go into effect on 1st August, and by that date, miners have to show the network they're ready for SegWit by creating blocks with the version 'bit 1'. BIP 148-compatible nodes will reject blocks found by miners that do not signal the upgrade. But it's hard to say what will happen after that. If the majority of hash power signals its support, the full network is projected to follow that chain. If they don't, though, there's potential for a split, where there are two separate blockchains with two different transaction histories and two different tradeable bitcoin assets. Some have already posted guides on preparing for the date, detailing how users can keep their funds safe in the event that this occurs. Given the potential for a network split, some are less than enthusiastic about the proposal. For one, BIP 148 is more controversial than a 'traditional' UASF would be. Should users want to push through a protocol change, there may be safer ways to do so. This has led to a mixed reception from developers working on the open-source project, who have long sought to emphasize and promote user safety. ""I personally don't support it,"" said Bitcoin Core contributor Jonas Schnelli, adding that the change likely won't be integrated into the Bitcoin Core codebase. Schnelli indicated his support of a different proposal, stating: BIP 149 is also a UASF, but it differs from BIP 148 in that miners need to do less to remain a part of a network upgraded to Segregated Witness. Rather than signal for SegWit, they only have to avoid building on top of blocks that the network considers invalid. BIP 149 would start after the current SegWit deployment times out in November, as some developers argue it's safer to wait until then before creating a new deployment that could be incompatible with old nodes. BIP 149 is tentatively scheduled for 4th July, 2018, though the timeline is still up for debate. And, there are other concerns with BIP 148 as it stands today. Developer Greg Slepak said the ""whole idea is idiotic given the lack of replay protection"", referencing a problem that played out last year when an ethereum software upgrade split the network in two. This led to a situation where coins could be spent on both chains. Others argue that, while a UASF might be necessary at some point, now might not be the right time. OpenBazaar's lead back-end developer, Chris Pacia, indicated he would only support a UASF if there was near-unanimous support beyond just miners. ""But my read of the community at this point is that there isn't consensus on SegWit, and a UASF poses a real risk of creating a chain split,"" he said. The best way forward, according to Pacia, is Segwit2x – a more recent proposal that has support from most major bitcoin businesses and 80% of bitcoin miners. To some, such as Pace, there's a risk also in waiting too long to activate SegWit. He said: Litecoin, a lesser-known cryptocurrency, has recently drawn attention for activating SegWit, a move that occurred after a closed-door meeting between network miners and developers. Pace added that he believes that BIP 148 will find a lot of support. ""I have a feeling a lot of people will underestimate [BIP 148], much like [ethereum classic], and will be caught unprepared,"" he continued. Many, including the original ethereum blockchain developers, expected ethereum classic, the old chain, to die off in the community's transition to a new blockchain last summer. It didn't, and now there are two competing tokens. So far, 33 bitcoin companies have signaled support for BIP 148. But what really matters in terms of pushing miners to support is whether the 'economic majority' supports it. In other words, major exchanges and wallets are key here, but many of the big players, such as Coinbase, Blockchain and Kraken, have yet to pledge loyalty to the effort. Still, there are even more complexities. Some claim a UASF, if done right, will have more of a psychological effect. Shaolinfry, the pseudonymous developer who rekindled the idea of a UASF, argued that the mere prospect of a UASF is what pushed litecoin mining pools into supporting activation of SegWit. Similarly, some have argued, the same prospect of a UASF is what led so many mining pools to support Segwit2x. And, still others think that now BIP 148 is going to happen, the safest option is for users to just go with it. Bitcoin Core contributor Nicolas Dorier, for instance, argued those who do not run BIP 148 software are more at risk in the event of a split because of potential reorganizations. ""I personally think that BIP 148 will work. I would have preferred [the] status quo, but the safest way for my services is to update to BIP 148,"" wrote Dorier, who works on QBit Ninja, an API for querying the blockchain. However, it's unclear whether other bitcoin service providers will make the same decision. If they don't, though, Coinkite CEO and co-founder Novak Rodolfo said BIP 148 isn't the only option for those inclined to change the network's rules.

Public records show that Gov. Chris Sununu signed measure on 2nd June, more than a month after the state's legislature completed work on the bill. The measure was first introduced in January. According to the text of the bill, the new rules exempt ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"" from the state's money transmitter regulations. The bill is notable given that it enjoyed strong grassroots support in the state, yet its top regulators largely blasted it during public hearings. During a hearing in April, advocates strongly urged legislators to adopt the measure, while representatives from the state's Banking and Justice Departments called for it to be scuttled. Divisions among state lawmakers on the bill could be seen during a vote in March, when it cleared the House of Representatives by a 185-170 margin. When the State Senate took up the measure in April, it passed by a 13-10 vote, public records show. The newly-signed bill also stands out for what is effectively deregulation for the state's trader community, whereas other states have looked to beef up rules for those who engage in similar activities. As might be expected, the effort was cheered by community members who have called for fewer regulations for those who work with digital currencies like bitcoin. The law goes into effect on 1st August. Old Man of the Mountain image via Wikimedia

Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, while also securing the history of transactions. The grant is drawn from a public aid program called the Big Sky Economic Development Trust Fund Program, aimed at supporting long-term job growth. Notably, it represents the first time that a US bitcoin miner has received state funding to support its operations. According to statements from the office of Montana Governor Steve Bullock, 65 jobs will be supported by the grant. The funds, the state government said in a release, will be used for the ""purchase of equipment, machinery, furniture and software and for wage reimbursement"".

In a letter dated 2nd June and penned by Representatives Jared Polis and David Schweikert – co-chairs of the Blockchain Caucus, a congressional group which was founded last autumn – the two called on the tax agency to ""issue additional guidance on the tax consequences and basic tax reporting requirements for transactions using virtual currencies"". The letter invokes recommendations issued last November by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), which criticized the IRS for its lack of a comprehensive strategy around digital currencies. At the time, TIGTA said that the agency's shortcomings were leaving investors in the dark and increasing the risk of possible tax avoidance. Polis and Schweikert encouraged the IRS to ""consider the recommendations of the TIGTA and take action based on those recommendations"". Notably, they urged the IRS to work with the digital currency space directly as it moves forward. The co-chairs wrote: This is the second letter sent to IRS from Congress in recent days on the subject of digital currencies. Late last month, a group including Senator Orin Hatch requested a response from the agency about its investigation into digital currency exchange Coinbase. That response is due today, though whether it has been formally delivered to Congress has not yet been announced. Capitol Hill image via Shutterstock

AT&T first filed its patent application in April 2015. According to records from the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), the patent was awarded on 30th May. At the time of its release, the application was notable for the fact that AT&T hadn’t revealed much of its work with the tech prior.

                            Are Sidechains a Better Solution for Bitcoin's Scaling Debate?                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/are-sidechains-a-better-solution-for-bitcoins-scaling-debate/,"The thinking on sidechains might be shifting. While historically seen as an avenue for experimentation and increased operability on bitcoin's network, the conversation is now framing the technology as a possible solution to the digital currency's long-standing scaling debate. The idea behind sidechains is to allow many coins with different sets of rules to be tied to bitcoin. For instance, one sidechain might feature the advanced privacy of MimbleWimble, while another might allow for much larger (or even smaller) block sizes. The latter is what’s piquing interest in sidechains as a way to circumvent bitcoin’s highly contentious block size debate. It's an idea which could theoretically make everyone happy, according to some. But it's not that sidechains achieve higher throughput, stressed Paul Sztorc, an economist at Bloq Inc, who invented a sidechain called Drivechain. With this model, though, participants would have the choice to move their bitcoin over to a sidechain with a larger block size (say, 2MB) while still remaining a part of the bitcoin network. However, there have been a flood of other ideas recently proposed for solving the block size issue that sidechains must now contend with. Extension blocks, for example, were recently reintroduced by bitcoin startup Purse with the same goal of giving users choice over block sizes. Yet, some developers, including one of the originators of extension blocks, Blockstream CEO Adam Back, believe extension blocks would downgrade security for users. This is one reason why Sztorc's Drivechain proposal – where what happens on one chain hypothetically can't negatively impact what happens on others – appears to have the blessing of some developers who have opposed other recent scaling proposals. Sztorc proposed the solution to the bitcoin developer mailing list, requesting feedback during CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference. Still, some developers argue it's not one versus the other, but a matter of which technology works better for which applications. “I can see a few potential use cases for extension blocks, such as adding MimbleWimble support to bitcoin,” said bitcoin developer James Hilliard. “But, I generally see sidechains as better due to the security isolation."" Yet, some argue that Drivechain (and other variation of sidechains which rely on miners) might not work optimally in the current environment where mining hashrate is concentrated in the hands of a few. For other developers, it depends on the details. “In general, [Drivechain] sounds like a fine idea; but specifics are important,” said Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr. Back to the issue of scaling, though. In particular, Sztorc framed Drivechain as a better solution than the Digital Currency Group's (DCG) recently unveiled 'Segwit2x' proposal. The latter, which aims to steer the industry toward a transaction capacity boost, has found significant backing from bitcoin businesses and miners. For the boost, SegWit2x combines two tech upgrades: an optimization called SegWit, which previously stalled mainly due to lack of miner support, and a boost to bitcoin's block size parameter. Sztorc, like several others, is skeptical, though. He told CoinDesk: Instead, he argued, Drivechain is superior for a number of reasons – primarily, perhaps, that sidechains “avoids coercion"". SegWit2x requires a hard fork to scale the block size to 2MB. That's a boost not everyone in the ecosystem agrees with, partly because it would mean an increase in the amount of data each user needs to store. And the change might lead to a network split if not everyone upgrades their software. Meanwhile, sidechains don't require a hard fork. And, Sztorc argued, users can spin up a sidechain featuring whatever block size they want, whether 8MB or 50MB, as 2MB is a one-time increase that some argue is too small. Further, some in the bitcoin community believe the volunteer developer team around the Bitcoin Core implementation has effectively become a monopoly, suggesting that the group has quashed outside ideas. Drivechain, according to Sztorc, would eliminate both of these undesired issues, since users would get to choose exactly what they want, and different developer groups could form around different sidechains, boosting developer diversity. Sztorc suggested Drivechain could be deployed within the same six-month timeframe as DCG's recent proposal, even with the proposal's requirement for a bitcoin soft fork (a backwards-compatible way of making changes to bitcoin’s consensus rules). This upgrading process has recently become more politicized with SegWit's proposal. But, Sztorc doesn’t think a soft fork will be a problem for Drivechain, since it gives ""everyone what they want"". Still, as with most other major proposals for improvements to bitcoin's code, the community will have to just wait and see.

After being elected in 2014, Sundin has helped turn the nation’s banks into some of the most progressive in the world when it comes to working with bitcoin startups. And now he’s joined Sweden’s largest bitcoin exchange, BTCX, as chairman of the board. But Sundin’s involvement with the firm is about more than bringing attention to one of the oldest bitcoin exchanges in Europe. An entrepreneur in his own right, having co-founded Sweden’s Warp Institute, which aimed to help accelerate technological innovation, Sundin intends to take a hands-on role at the bitcoin exchange. He told CoinDesk: BTCX is growing at a rate of about 1,200 customers per month, with transaction volume over the same time at around 2 million euros. At the core of the firm's expansion plans lies what Sundin characterized as a willingness by the company to work with established banks, not just disrupt them. Sundin first met the BTCX team during his 2014 election campaign, when he raised about two bitcoins in donations from 50 donors around the world. Already a member of the Swedish Parliament with the Liberal party, Sundin had set about transforming himself into a representative of the bitcoin community after reading a New York Times article by venture capitalist Marc Andreessen. Reading the article changed his impression of bitcoin as a way to buy ""drugs and mushrooms"" to a way of giving more power to normal people. Sundin said: A bitcoin-only exchange when it launched in 2012, BTCX has expanded on that business, introducing, with Sundin’s help in 2015, what it termed a Swedish Bitcoin Embassy aimed at educating the public. Now registered with the Swedish Tax Authority and the Swedish Financial Supervision Authority, the company’s educational efforts have evolved into what more closely resembles blockchain consulting services, offering lectures for 24,990 Swedish krona or about $3,000. These lectures originated from an invitation from Sundin shortly after he was elected to address members of Swedish banks, which had been hesitant to offer bitcoin companies bank accounts on the basis of what they were concerned might be underdeveloped regulatory compliance. BTCX ""could show the banks and everyone else that they're following every regulation,"" Sundin said. ""And they showed the Swedish IRS and everyone that we’re doing everything by the book here and there’s nothing fishy going on."" The result? BTCX obtained a bank account at Sweden’s largest bank, SEB, and is now helping teach other regional startups how to do the same. Since then, Sundin said his perception among fellow Parliament members has evolved from being the ""weird and funny"" bitcoin proponent to someone representing a more mainstream interest. Reacting to news earlier this year that Sweden’s land registry was exploring putting titles on a blockchain, many other government departments have started looking for potential benefits to their own work, Sundin said. In addition to helping bitcoin startups obtain recognition by Sweden’s banks, Sundin has turned his attention to working with startups outside bitcoin and blockchain and the venture capitalists who support them. Though, Sundin had no comment on Swedish startup Brave New World Investments using cryptocurrencies to facilitate investment in Iran. BTCX plans to publicly launch a new payment platform this summer, providing businesses a service license. And, later this year, the company plans on releasing a new exchange into stealth mode. As recently as last Thursday, Sundin met with BTCX, to begin parlaying his experience with startups and investors into an effort to help the company define its future — not only as an entity to itself, but as a leader in the space, helping other Swedish bitcoin companies gain traction. Sundin explained his attraction to the exchange, saying: Mathias Sundin image via Leif Jansson

                            Andresen is Back With a One-Man Security Project Inspired by Bitcoin Mishaps                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/andresen-back-one-man-security-project-inspired-bitcoin-mishaps/,"Gavin Andresen, the former lead developer of bitcoin, is breaking his silence. While in recent months he's been more active on Twitter discussing the block size debate (even stamping his name on a new bitcoin scaling 'agreement'), Andresen has largely been absent from the bitcoin developer community for about a year. But, that doesn't mean the prodigious worker, who did much to help build out bitcoin's early developer team and market, hasn't been busy. At the beginning of May, Andresen tweeted:  The project looks to better secure the internet by checking sources of randomness used by individuals and organizations. The Random Sanity Project not only stemmed from Andresen's interest in learning the programming language GO, but also in seeing the problems a lack of entropy can have in monetary software systems like bitcoin. ""I certainly still do keep up with bitcoin,"" Andresen told CoinDesk, adding that he might contribute code review to DCG's new bitcoin scaling proposal, but that he's unlikely to write any of the code. ""Bitcoin is such an interesting project because it’s security critical,"" he said. ""If the security fails, it's immediately obvious, people lose money and react immediately."" This is different, he continued, than an email account being taken over or attacked, in that people typically don't notice those breaches for some time. ""For a lot of security issues, bitcoin brings them into the light,"" Andresen said. This quick reaction was seen in several mishaps based on faulty random number generation in the bitcoin ecosystem. In May 2015, a vulnerability in Blockchain's Android bitcoin wallet left several users out money. According to Softpedia, the vulnerability allowed duplicate bitcoin addresses to be created and given to different users. At its core, the problem was with Blockchain's random number generator, random.org, which provided insufficient entropy on certain versions of the Android operating system. And two years before, in August 2013, all bitcoin wallet applications on Android operating systems were potentially at risk when several vulnerabilities were found within another random number generator, Java SecureRandom. While the project is definitely tangential to Andresen’s former work as bitcoin's lead maintainer, it’s also much different. ""So far, it's a one-person project, which I like,"" Andresen told CoinDesk. ""It’s nice and simple. I chose something small and intentionally boring."" He continued: Andresen has been working on the Random Sanity Project for about six months. According to him, the project is not intended to be a profit-making business. Instead, ideally, the project would be sponsored by an entity like the Linux Foundation to offer the service to anyone for free. So how does Random Sanity work? Every system and every programming language has a way of getting random bytes – for instance, Linux has a special folder called '/dev/urandom' and OpenSSL provides several random number generators (which Bitcoin Core uses). Users of the Random Sanity Project can take those random numbers – from 16 to 64 bytes – and input them into the service, which will return a 'true' if the bytes look random, or a 'false' if the numbers don't. ""The problem of detecting whether your random numbers are good enough is a tricky problem,"" Andresen told CoinDesk. ""There are a bunch of ways you can screw up."" While random number generators are created specifically to provide entropy (a lack of order, and hence predictability), there are several reasons something might go wrong. Software downloads and upgrades can mess with randomness. Or it can be as simple as someone tripping over the virtual machine utilizing a random number generator cord and unplugging it. But a typical failure, Andresen said, is when an organization is using cloud computing and starts up multiple virtual machines at the same time. In this case, the organization might save an image of the software and run multiple copies for the web servers that handle traffic. Because the virtual machines are starting in the same state, they could, according to Andresen, come up with the same 'random' numbers. ""There are usually tools for increasing entropy so this doesn't happen,"" he said, ""but [the Random Sanity Project] could be a good check."" While he doesn't think a company needs to run every string of bytes a machine gives them through the tool, it would be beneficial to send one string of bytes when the machine starts up to make sure it's generating reasonable randomness. Then, he said, if it fails, the problem can be investigated. ""This is designed as a way to make sure catastrophic disasters don't happen, or you catch them quick enough,"" said Andresen. Further, the more people and organizations that use the system, the more valuable it becomes, because it can then base randomness on many more strings of bytes. Currently, though, only a few have beta tested the service, sometimes contributing code back to the project – including people from startups Blockchain and ShapeShift, according to Andresen. On Twitter, some praised the service, while others were worried about the system's architecture. For one, the initial system used HTTP, which allowed anyone to eavesdrop and see the random bytes being sent to the system. Andresen quickly relaunched using HTTPS to provide a secure connection so that no one can see what bytes are sent. If an entity’s random number generator is broken, seeing one supposedly random string of bytes could open that entity up to attack, said another complaint from a Twitter user. A chance worth taking, Andresen responded. As far as Andresen having insight into the bytes being sent to the service, he said he has none. And, following the trend set by bitcoin, he said: While the service is currently running on the App Engine of the Google Cloud Platform, his next project is opening the project up to allow auditing by third parties. Presently, people can only audit the open-source code on GitHub, which Andresen assured CoinDesk, is exactly what’s running on the App Engine. The extra step, though, will prove it Random numbers image via Shutterstock

As explained by Xiangfu Liu, co-founder of bitcoin mining chip maker Canaan, there are few things more sacred in bitcoin than the idea that the strength of a blockchain is the computing power dedicated to securing its ledger. But while bitcoin's miners remain united in this daily pursuit, their opinions on a new scaling proposal seem decidedly mixed. Known as 'Segwit2x', the proposal, spearheaded by bitcoin investment conglomerate Digital Currency Group, aims to move forward with two changes to the bitcoin network: an optimization called Segregated Witness (SegWit) and an increase to the hardcoded parameter limiting the size of its transaction blocks. Notable about the effort is its claim it draws support from more than 80% of bitcoin's computing power. Mining industry participants including Bitcoin.com, Bitfury, Bitmain, BTCC, F2Pool and ViaBTC all signed an agreement supporting the solution, alongside roughly 50 industry startups. Such participation has done much to lend validation to the effort. That's because, due to how the network functions, miners (along with nodes) must upgrade to any new software – a position some have argued makes them voters in a kind of electoral process. Still, their motivations and exceptions appear varied. Notable was a palpable fatigue in answering questions about protocol changes at all, a sign of the years-long debate that's split the industry. Wang Chun, owner of F2Pool, a signatory on the proposal which accounts for more than 7% of bitcoin's hashing power, suggested he wasn't supporting it from a position of enthusiasm. Chun told CoinDesk: Others broke along typical partisan lines. Haipo Yang, founder and CEO of mining pool ViaBTC, which represents roughly 4% of the bitcoin network's hash power, for example, was in favor of the proposal. Long a proponent of boosting the block size to 2MB via a hard fork, Yang went so far as to state the mechanism could force those who disagree off the blockchain. ""[A split] is a good thing in my opinion,"" he said, citing philosophical disagreements with bitcoin developers (who have largely been critical of the proposal). Jack Liao, CEO of LightningAsic, a maker of bitcoin ATMs, miners and wallet hardware, agreed, but from the opposite angle. He cited past issues with alternative implementations of the bitcoin software as evidence that Bitcoin Core, the network's largely volunteer group of developers, is the ""only good team"" that could help steer and navigate such changes. Mixed feelings were also prevalent as bitcoin's startup community asserted itself in the technical conversation. Most past agreements, or attempts at agreements, have largely featured involvement from Bitcoin Core developers and China-based miners, as each group represents the largest bloc of constituents from the two parties most responsible for the network's daily functioning. But, Gadi Glikberg, owner of Connect BTC, a mining pool owned by hardware provider Bitmain, noted he believes startups play a key role as larger corporates have yet to become invested in the ecosystem. ""We don't have any real large enterprises yet. I think that in this example startups fill in that void and speak as an important actor in the ecosystem,"" he said. Others were open to the idea, but think this assertion creates a mixed context for discussion, because, from an academic perspective, it may not be clear which businesses are best suited for the use of a blockchain, a technology created by bitcoin and with little past precedent. ""Philosophically, I'm not convinced bitcoin actually has a problem,"" said long-time bitcoin miner and GigaWatt founder Dave Carlson. ""It just presents a problem for certain business models."" Carlson added, that as GigaWatt hosts miners on behalf of individuals who then elect mining pools, his firm believes in letting miners choose which solution to support. Others saw a similar conclusion putting pressure on the debate. ""I think some companies can use the private blockchain for sure,"" Liu said. However, here he noted that the appeal of the hashing power securing the ledger makes the bitcoin blockchain quite valuable to startups. Overall, though, remarks were positive about the deal, provided it could sidestep issues that have stymied by past disagreements. Of particular reference was the so-called 'Hong Kong Agreement', a meeting of developers and miners that also saw participation from 80% of bitcoin's mining power providers. That agreement called for the completion of SegWit and a hard fork in mid-2017, though it broke down as key deadlines were missed. ""In China, there is always talk about the Hong Kong Agreement. So, as long as people follow the agreement, I think this is doable,"" Liu remarked. Elsewhere, supporters noted that much is riding on the specific technology that will underlie the proposal and change the network rules. Currently, development is being overseen by bitcoin security startup BitGo, with help from other developers including Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik. Startups including Bitcoin.com, Bitfury and Xapo have pledged technical assistance, though they have yet to provide details on what this would entail. Still, there was a sense that amid a booming market for cryptocurrencies, the ecosystem now has new resolve to make changes that boost both the perception of bitcoin and the scalability of its underlying technology. ""I think that the companies that committed to the agreement remain committed,"" Glikberg said, concluding: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitGo, Bloq and Xapo.

According to a Form D published today by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, the Nevada-based firm sold $1m in equity.

Yet a filing from March suggests that BTCS may be on shaky ground-revenue wise – an issue that has dogged the bitcoin mining startup in the past. BTCS said that it expects to report $361,000 in revenue for the year ending 31st December 2016. ""The Company expects to report a substantial increase in loss from operations which at the time of this report has yet to be dermined[sic] due to the complex nature of the Company’s derivative liabilities,"" the firm added in the filing.

                            Bitcoin's 'Segwit2x' Scaling Proposal: Core Developers Strike Critical Stance                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-core-developers-react/,"Days after a widely-supported but contentious proposal for increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity was unveiled, technical details about the plan are coming to light. It might not be particularly surprising if you're very familiar with bitcoin's long-standing block-size debate, but the tentative code for what's now known as 'Segwitx2' hasn't been especially well-received by the project's open-source developer community. One so-called pull request from Bloq co-founder Jeff Garzik, for example, was greeted with a chorus of skeptical comments. Most were rather technical, coming from some developers who have worked on bitcoin for a long time, but the response seemed to boil down to: 'Why isn't the group using a safer method – one that many of us suggested earlier on?' Some of the comments seemed to carry a mocking tone. ""This pull request is quite odd,"" Colu blockchain research lead Udi Wertheimer stated in his reply. ""There are still no tests,"" another developer stated simply. Still, Garzik, a former Bitcoin Core developer employed by bitcoin processor BitPay, welcomed the feedback, and later in the day, he responded on Medium. ""This was a starting point,"" he said, indicating his stance that the current implementation on GitHub is meant to be a work in progress. Garzik added that he agrees with the feedback received and endorses making changes that enable the code to be compatible with the existing version of Segregated Witness (or SegWit) – a plan to scale the blockchain proposed by Bitcoin Core contributors in 2015. ""If the outcome maximizes compatibility even more, re-uses existing testing even more, that is a win. Forward progress,"" Garzik wrote. Yet for all the implied derision, this developer debate could be viewed as an example of 'collaboration' and peer review. It's probably worth noting that none of the volunteer developers behind Bitcoin Core signed the ‘agreement’ on the proposal, first announced by investment portfolio company DCG last week. As hinted in the concerns above, this was partly because of technical concerns, and partly because some don't believe that a hard fork is necessary right now. Capacity increases beyond SegWit, some argue, can be brought about in other backwards-compatible ways that don't risk kicking some network participants out of the system. Once the proposal was released, and even long before then, developers had given technical feedback about how best to deploy a hard fork, which might explain a hint of bitterness from developers in recent discussions. But, even if many of them aren't keen on details of the proposal, so far that hasn't stopped developers from trying to improve the implementation. ""I wrote BIP91 to try and make the proposal more sane,"" said bitcoin developer James Hilliard, adding that, in his eyes, the current hard fork timeline is ""completely unrealistic"". Others put more weight behind the proposal, which has backing from more than 60 companies and more than 80% of bitcoin's mining pool operators and firms. ""I think we should look to build from the proposal and improve it,"" Blockstream CEO Adam Back said. Overall, Back has emerged as perhaps one of the more positive voices, with comments suggesting pushback from developers could create perception issues. In particular, he's trying to steer interest toward a proposal called 'spoonnet', a branch of hard fork research from Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau. Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo, who worked on SegWit code, had a similar collaborative take. ""I will work hard with [DCG founder and CEO Barry Silbert] to make this a success,"" he wrote on social media, though not without some caveats. The bottom line, though, is that many developers don't think the proposal is a good one. Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop summed up the concerns the most succinctly: ""I think the entire industry needs to wake up and realize how long these things take,"" he added, arguing that peer review and testing takes a long time. (Other developers and bitcoin users have also questioned the six-month timeline.) Perhaps the more important question though is: if the group addresses these technical concerns, would more developers support it? The response, as usual, was complicated and mixed, with some expressing a desire to consider all the tradeoffs. ""There's a general sentiment among Bitcoin Core developers that a tremendous amount of capacity can be gained by soft forks and backwards-compatible upgrades. I don't think that Bitcoin Core developers are going to rally around a hard fork in the near future, especially not one dictated by a closed-door secret meeting,"" Bishop said. Developer Jonas Schnelli, known for the libbtc library, said he could possibly get behind a hard fork for a block-size increase if given more time. ""I’m happy with SegWit2x if it could reduce to 80% without being incompatible to the existing [SegWit] implementation,"" Schnelli said. ""And do the [hard fork] later."" Others simply don't think that it will work, seeming to treat it with the same interest as they treated Bitcoin XT or Bitcoin Classic – other hard fork proposals that failed (although this new effort has garnered more support). Many developers expressed the sentiment that transaction capacity could be increased in other, perhaps safer, ways. For one, some tend to think that SegWit is a better solution on its own – without the accompanying hard fork, which could lead to a network split. ""On SegWit2x, there is no technical reason to couple [Segwit] with a [hard fork]. Only political. And bitcoin was created to stay away from politics … this is why I mainly [do] not support it,” said Schnelli. Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr was open to yet another recent proposal, called COOP, which combines a bunch of hard-fork research into one bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP), for safer deployment. But, he had reservations about increasing the block size so quickly. Dashjr has actively promoted BIP148, a controversial backwards-compatible mechanism that’s been gaining momentum and that also has a deadline for activation, though some worry it too could result in a chain split.

A representative for has OKCoin confirmed a report today that withdrawals had resumed at the exchange, one of the largest in the world by volume. The spokesperson added, however, that withdrawals would be contingent on passing a verification requirement and prescribing to a $1m annual limit. Still, signs suggest that OKCoin won't be alone in resuming operations. According to a representative for the exchange, withdrawals could be opened at Huobi as soon as tomorrow. The representative also confirmed that OKCoin's withdrawals were being reactivated. At press time, it remains unclear if fellow bitcoin exchange BTCC is on the cusp of resuming withdrawals as well. A representative for the startup did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Nonetheless, sources say the sudden change is the result of a thawing of sentiment at the People's Bank of China, which has been increasingly active on blockchain R&D and more understanding of bitcoin's role in the larger technology industry. The exchange freeze, put in place amid an escalating price at the start of the year, has so far lasted for months, after China's exchanges – following warnings from regulators, including the People's Bank of China – froze withdrawals and began overhauling their systems. Those upgrades were said to be completed in March. Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

While the plan doesn't yet appear to be set in stone, reports indicate that the Bank of Russia is planning to recognize cryptocurrencies as digital goods, with the relevant tax to be applied. The legislation would also reportedly include language establishing how the government will surveil and regulate the domestic marketplace. What they're saying: According to news sources Bloomberg and RBC, the details came out of a parliamentary hearing at which Olga Skorobogatova, deputy governor of the Bank of Russia, discussed her institution's work on new legislation. Skorobogatova, on 25th May, reportedly said that legislation could be introduced in the Duma – Russia's national legislature – as early as next month. While no transcript of the 25th May meeting was immediately available, both sources quoted comments by Skorobogatova from last year, when she called for some kind of taxation and legal recognition of cryptocurrencies. Cryptocurrencies ""should be regulated, because volumes are increasing compared to the previous year. If people are engaged in this, they have to pay money for it, and we have to have a clear understanding of how to control this activity"", Skorobogatova said, as reported by Bloomberg. In April, word emerged that a new legislative push had begun, but follow-up comments suggested that it might take more time than originally anticipated. How we got here: Those watching the space for the past couple of years will know Russia has been moving ever closer toward some kind of legislative framework for digital currencies. Initially, the government seemed primed to adopt a harsh stance regarding the creation of issuance of so-called ""money surrogates"". At one point, Russian officials publicly toyed with the idea of prison sentences for crimes associated with the tech. That position has largely softened in recent months, accompanied by growing enthusiasm for blockchain among both officials from the Bank of Russia as well as the government itself. Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev, for example, has pushed for research into public applications of the tech. Moscow image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's 'Segwit2x' Scaling Proposal: Where the Startups Stand                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-segwit2x-scaling-proposal-startups-stand/,"New information is coming out about a proposal that some hope could lead to a long-awaited increase to bitcoin's transaction capacity, a stagnant feature that many in the community believe is holding back the cryptocurrency's growth and utility. Although there have been past efforts aimed at putting an end to bitcoin's two-year scaling debate, the new 'agreement' has perhaps earned unprecedented support from companies and mining pool operators, with over 50 bitcoin companies and firms representing more than 80% of bitcoin's mining power signing the proposal. The goal, according to the announcement blog post released last week, is to move forward with two changes: an optimization called Segregated Witness and a 2MB block size increase. Although, the latter is arguably the main point of contention, since it could potentially lead to the creation of two bitcoin networks if not all users agree with the change. Beyond that, though, details have been thin. The community and even some of the participants were at least initially confused about aspects of the plan: Which upgrade is supposed to come first? Where's the code? Do supporters think it will lead to a network split? (Is that the goal?) However, new details are coming out which might not totally clarify the situation, but help show how companies involved are thinking about these questions. One new development is that participants are beginning to put together code – another point that sets the proposal apart from past attempts to come to a consensus on a solution, such as one widely known as the Hong Kong agreement. For example, while bitcoin technology company BitGo did not sign the new agreement, the company has ""pledged technical resources"" to formalize it into working code. ""The plan we're putting together is laser-focused on building a deployable [minimum viable product] for our mission ... All work will be done in the open, and we welcome constructive debate,"" BitGo co-founder and CEO Mike Belshe wrote in a leaked email describing a rough roadmap called 'Segwit2x'. (BitGo did not respond to CoinDesk's requests about its involvement in the effort.) The roadmap tentatively schedules the first software version release for 16th June, at which point the open-source community can give their feedback. If all goes according to plan, bitcoin users will be able to download the new, finalized bitcoin software about a month later on 21st July. The three-day-old implementation so far includes contributions from Bloq co-founder and Bitcoin Core contributor Jeff Garzik. (Perhaps it's worth noting that some of the technical feedback has been critical and partly politicized, so far.) Other developers, such have Lightning Network co-inventor Joseph Poon, have also expressed an interest in contributing to help build a safe, new version. Against this backdrop, some participants initially seemed not to agree, or at least were confused by the terms of the agreement. However, when contacted, companies involved largely seem to be on the same page. Though initial feedback from the community was mixed, all companies that responded said that they agree to move forward with the proposal. ""I think it's an important step towards breaking a stalemate that is causing bitcoin to stagnate,"" said Joshua Scigala, CEO of bitcoin-gold exchange Vaultoro, though he mentioned that he would have liked to have seen ""a couple of more months to prepare"". Valery Vavilov, CEO of blockchain technology company Bitfury Group, told CoinDesk that the agreement ""has not changed"" in light of community responses, and SFOX co-founder and developer Akbar Thobhani said much the same. Others were more diplomatically short on the matter. ""We understand there are different visions for bitcoin among the community, and Coinbase is supportive of both on- and off-chain scaling improvements,"" said a company representative. That said, several companies on the list, including DCG and its subsidiaries, Purse, Blockchain and Xapo declined to comment. Following the proposal release, one of the key points of community contention is that Bitcoin Core contributors, the volunteer developers behind bitcoin's primary software, were absent from the meeting and the signed agreement. Some of these developers stated in the aftermath of the proposal that they don't think the plan is technically viable and that the timeline is too short. Others have gone as far as to argue that the agreement is a political move – a way to replace Bitcoin Core developers, who work on a volunteer basis, with another team. On this note, some companies mentioned that they are simply frustrated with the lack of scaling progress. For one, since transaction capacity has remained stagnant, transaction fees have swelled, affecting users and businesses. “Many Bitcoin Core developers stopped listening to businesses, miners and users over two years ago. If they are unwilling to compromise, then the compromise will move forward without them,” said Yours CEO Ryan X Charles, adding: Genesis Mining co-founder and CEO Marco Streng shared a similar sentiment. ""We're supporting bitcoin – and it goes without saying that the individuals responsible for bitcoin will change as the project ages. We'll support these individuals (or groups), whomever they may be,"" he said. SFOX's Thobhani suggested that the release of the rough proposal is just a first step that could lead to wider consensus. ""This is a process and not a stance,"" he said. ""I am hopeful that through this process we will identify a way to discuss different views and find a path forward."" On the other hand, some signed the agreement with the idea that they would like the team to stay onboard. ""We really hope the agreement will ultimately reunite the community. Having the Bitcoin Core developers aboard is a vital part of the plan for Bitwala,"" a representative from Bitwala said. “We have the utmost respect for the Bitcoin Core developers and we are working to create an agreement and technical roadmap that suits everyone and is best for the future of bitcoin,” Vavilov said. Participants that responded also appear to agree that the proposal, including the hard fork, will happen. ""If a hard fork is the only way to solve the scaling problems – among other issues – then that is how it has to be,"" as Streng put it. But, following the change, companies have different ideas about what the outcome will be. ""We believe a hard fork with roughly 75% support from business, miners and users would be strong enough that it would thrive even in the midst of two competing chains,"" Charles said. Others think that two chains are unlikely to survive, with the new 'Segwit2x' coin pulling in the majority of the bitcoin ecosystem. ""Strong consensus is needed to initiate the hard fork, so seriously competing chains are unlikely. Probably the less popular chain would remain a niche,"" said MONI marketing lead Ilkka Montin. Some feel that the 2MB component is a critical piece. ""We're at a point where SegWit alone won’t be enough for the current needs of the network,"" said Ripio CEO and co-founder Sebastian Serrano. On the other hand, some companies mentioned that they also support other methods of deploying SegWit on its own, which has stalled due to lack of support from mining pool operators. In this way, some see another controversial proposal, called UASF (for 'user-activated soft fork'), as another potential way forward. Scigala said that his company is looking at how to ""safely participate"". Although it’s complex, the downside, like with a hard fork, is that the method of upgrading bitcoin could also lead to a chain split. One difference, according to UASF advocates (who appear to be moving forward with what they call a bitcoin ""Independence Day"" slated for 1st August) is that a soft fork is a backwards-compatible change, while a hard fork isn’t. ""Nobody in the community would deny that scaling is needed. SegWit had been blocked by some powerful miners and those miners want a higher block size, so now it’s either UASF or SegWit with a higher block size,"" said a representative from Bitwala, who concluded: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has ownership stakes in BitGo, Bitwala, Blockchain, Coinbase, MONI, Purse and Xapo.

                            Bitcoin Returns to Rangebound Trading As Price Rollercoaster Subsides                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-returns-rangebound-trading-price-rollercoaster-subsides/," Global bitcoin prices experienced little volatility today – a notable contrast to the sharp fluctuations that have taken place over the last week. Overall, the price of bitcoin rose to as much as $2,329.64, before falling more than 5% to $2,218.74 at 15:45 UTC, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At the time of report, bitcoin prices had recovered somewhat, rising to $2,245.97. In comparison, bitcoin prices experienced a notable rally last week, reaching almost $2,800 on 25th May, before plunging more than $400 to almost $2,350 less than four hours later, additional BPI figures show. This price volatility continued after the sharp drop, as bitcoin recovered to $2,640 early on 26th May before falling once again, this time losing more than $700 and declining below $2,000 on 27th May. Bitcoin prices bounced back the following day, rising to $2,320.82 at 09:30 UTC on 28th May. Bitcoin's recent price volatility has coincided with sharp fluctuations in the market capitalization of all public cryptocurrencies, which surged to $91bn on 24th May before plunging 40% to $57.3bn on 27th May. At press time, this figure has recovered to more than $80bn today, amid strong gains in the price of ether, ether classic and others. Balancing image via Shutterstock

The Department of Justice announced late last week that Michael Lord and his father, Randall Lord, were sentenced to 106 months and 46 months, respectively. Both were charged with running an unlawful money business, while the younger Lord plead guilty to a narcotics distribution conspiracy charge. The two plead guilty last year. Court records show that Michael Lord operated a LocalBitcoins.com profile, with the moniker 'Internet151', dating back to 2012. The profile lists more than 3,000 confirmed trades since it was created. Prosecutors alleged that the Lords used a series of personal and business bank accounts as part of an effort to obscure their bitcoin exchanging. ""Cybercrime is an emerging area of criminal activity, and we want the criminals who hide behind logon names and internet aliases to know that IRS Special Agents will follow the money in whatever form, whether it be digital or paper currency,"" Jerome McDuffie, an IRS official, said in a statement. The case is the latest to involve a LocalBitcoins trader in the US. In the past month, two other users of the site have plead guilty to similar charges. In April, an Arizona-based bitcoin trader was arrested and held following a police raid. Other LocalBitcoins traders have been the subject of federal investigation in recent years.

                            How, When and Where Will Regulators Accept Bitcoin ETFs?                        ",Drew Pierson,https://www.coindesk.com/will-regulators-accept-bitcoin-etfs/,"Will bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) ever be accepted by regulators in the US or abroad? That's a question that's even more complex than would initially appear, say industry participants. A better question might be: is it regulators, specifically, that need convincing? After all, the agencies tasked with enforcing existing laws heavily consider input from multiple parties, including banks, many of whom have yet to embrace the still-nascent digital currency. That was the viewpoint put forward by Ryan Radloff, head of investor relations at XBT Provider, a Sweden-based issuer that's already succeeded in listing bitcoin exchange-traded notes on a public exchange. ""It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg problem between the banks and the regulators,"" Radloff said. On that point, even within the US, different regulators approach cryptocurrencies like bitcoin very differently. Bitcoin is a form of property to the IRS, a virtual currency to FinCEN and a vehicle for 'money transmission' in the eyes of various state regulators. The SEC has not yet taken an official stance on bitcoin's classification, but in the meantime, it has rejected two applications for bitcoin-backed exchange-traded funds thus far (the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF and the SolidX Bitcoin Trust). The outlook at the moment overall does not look promising, said Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, an investment management company that offers ETFs centered around emerging technologies. ""That was a pretty stern, hard line they drew,"" Burniske said of the SEC’s most recent ETF rejection. ""It's clear it's going to take more work to get the SEC to approve something like this."" Radloff concurred: However, exchange-traded funds aren't the only option for public investment. Futures contracts, which are overseen by another US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, could arrive first, Burniske said. And the CFTC already considers bitcoin a commodity. Regulation across the globe varies hugely, but is generally improving. ""The countries you expect to have the most innovative regulators in 'legacy finance' have the most conducive regulatory environment for innovation in new finance,"" Radloff explained. ""This would include Jersey, Switzerland, Malta, Gibraltar, Japan and Sweden. However in the last 18 months, there are a growing number of government bodies who have issued guidance around dealing in bitcoin, and this picture continues to become more clear,"" he continued, adding: Notably, there are exchange-traded bitcoin products in Europe, but they aren't ETFs, they are exchange-traded notes, which are similar to ETFs but carry different risks. However, European investors and regulators are more accustomed to ETNs, said Radloff. The COINXBE & COINXBT ETNs are listed on the Nasdaq Nordic. Another ETN-style bitcoin product was recently delisted on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange. Nick Cowan, managing director of the latter exchange, said he's expecting two similar bitcoin products to be listed soon, as well as a third based on a basket of several cryptocurrencies. ""We have a great regulator who took the responsibility for driving this process with external consultants,"" Cowan told CoinDesk. But what about criticisms that the market is immature? Today, there are only a handful of data points to draw on to evaluate the claim. The recent Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study by the University of Cambridge's Centre for Alternative Finance found that only 46% of cryptocurrency exchanges surveyed had a government license. Further, differences were found region to region. Eighty-five percent of exchanges based in Asia-Pacific did not have a license, whereas 78% of North American-based exchanges did. This discrepancy is explained, in part, by the fact that China does not have formal regulations for the industry. In addition, almost all of the exchanges that Cambridge researchers surveyed had their own compliance programs in place that fulfilled know-your-customer and anti-money laundering requirements, even if the exchanges did not have a formal license. Garrick Hileman, economic historian at the University of Cambridge and London School of Economics, said bitcoin industry participants have made a lot of progress over the years in their compliance efforts. ""Self-regulation and internally driven compliance programs are a big part of the story,"" Hileman said, adding: It's clear US regulators want to see stability and transparency before they approve a product that could invite a flood of money into a market less than a decade old. Still, industry observers also say the SEC’s comparison of the stability and transparency of bitcoin to equities stocks is apples to oranges, and that a more analogous comparison would be to commodities like gold and oil – the markets for which are often quite opaque (for example, OPEC decisions) and yet ETFs flourish. Communicating issues like these to regulators will be of key importance. In the meantime, the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF is appealing the SEC's rejection of its application, and there is also a cryptocurrency ETF application that has been made for an ether-based fund called the EtherIndex Ether Trust. The SEC declined comment when asked if it would treat an ether-based application differently, but in its official notice of the fund's application, it recognized at least one major difference: ""[U]nlike bitcoin, ether was not designed to function purely as a store of value."" In the end, an abundance of caution is good not only for investors, but for the cryptocurrencies as well, Ark Invest's Burniske said. This is because huge demand through ETFs could potentially strain the still-developing markets. The first gold ETF bought $40m in gold each day over its first 30 days, but estimates have suggested an ETF could attract as much as $300m to the cryptocurrency market. Given this potential boost, it's no wonder they remain a matter of interest for investors – and a potential prize for innovators. Bitcoin and official image via Shutterstock

Federal prosecutors alleged that Sal Mansy, a resident of Detroit, advertising a bitcoin buying and selling service through LocalBitcoins, conducting $2,400,000 worth of business between August 2013 and July 2015. According to court documents, undercover agents engaged in two trades between December 2014 and March 2015 with Mansy, for an amount totaling roughly 6.32 BTC – an amount worth a total of just under $1,900 at then-current prices. Mansy is the second user of LocalBitcoins to plead guilty to the unlicensed money service charge this month. Missouri resident Jason Klein plead guilty to selling bitcoin to undercover agents on five separate occasions, and a seller from Rochester, New York named Richard Petix plead guilty to the same charge a week prior. Court documents detail how Mansy would purchase bitcoin through digital currency exchanges Coinbase and Bitstamp, later selling the digital currency on LocalBitcoins and depositing the proceeds into bank accounts connected to a company he operated, TV TOYZ, which was also named in the government’s lawsuit. Coinbase, according to a prosecutorial filing from 15th May of this year, closed Mansy’s account in June 2014 after questioning him about the nature of his account. Communications between Mansy and support staff for Coinbase and Bitstamp were included in that document, showing how both exchanges raised questions about Mansy’s bitcoin purchases and whether he had registered with the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as a money transmitter. The prosecutorial document shows that Mansy argued, in discussions with the US Department of Homeland Security, that he wasn’t operating a money transmission business. ""According to Mansy, he had looked up the money service business requirements on the Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) website and determined that his business model did not apply to that of a money service business,"" the filing stated. Mansy faces as many as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines at sentencing later this year. Image via Shutterstock

At press time, bitcoin had topped $2,500 and a total market capitalization of $40bn for the first time ever. Ether, currently the second-largest by market capitalization, hit $228.37 at roughly 13:30 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap. By rising to this level, ether prices surpassed the previous record of $201.75 set on 22nd May, though at the time of report, the cryptocurrency's price had fallen back somewhat, trading at $188.18. Bitcoin and ether's price rose to this record level amid a broader rise in investments in cryptocurrencies, with others like zcash, hitting multi-month highs. Several analysts pointed to the general increase in attention on cryptographic assets of late as reason for the gain, with the CEO of Fidelity making a public statement of her enthusiasm for both bitcoin and ether yesterday at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference. Fidelity's statement coincided with an announcement that the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, a consortium focused on harnessing ethereum's technology for enterprise, had more than tripled in size as helping fuel ether's recent price gains. The alliance announced the addition of 86 members, including major corporations Merck, Samsung and Toyota. An announcement by JP Morgan that it would seek to use the open-source tech underlying zcash further impacted the price of that asset, with analysts largely crediting this move to its price breakout this week.

According to Adam White, head of Coinbase's GDAX exchange, the answer is you wouldn't want to simply support bitcoin alone. ""We'd design our exchange to be able to support more assets more quickly. There was this theory that network effects would aggregate everyone into one asset. We see that's not the case,"" he remarked at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference today in New York. White went on to tell attendees: The remarks come amid growing enthusiasm for blockchain-based cryptographic assets that offer different value propositions than bitcoin. Overall, the market for all cryptocurrencies is up 400% this year, rising to $88m from $17.6m in January. Amidst this diversification, Ola Doudin, CEO of Dubai-based bitcoin exchange and brokerage BitOasis, remarked on the rise in enthusiasm for alternative digital assets, noting how its customers in the Middle East are now twice as likely to buy ether than bitcoin. Tony Lyu, CEO and founder of Korbit, also discussed the challenges in listing new cryptographic assets, given the variety of new opportunities and the short attention spans of a small set of early adopters. ""For every asset we list, there's diminishing returns,"" Lyu said. ""If you go chasing to the next hot coin, by the time they launch it on the exchange, the fad has passed."" Conversation later turned to the subject of how, exactly, tokens should be dispersed to users. While the bitcoin software offered a mining network, enabling users to run computing power to gain a share of the bitcoins it created, entrepreneurs are now largely bucking this trend. Through a process called an initial coin offering (ICO), many projects are simply creating and selling tokens on existing blockchains to build a network effect and raise capital. Here, opinions were split with some industry luminaries emphasizing the opportunity the new blockchain use case creates, and others offering more bearish insight. ""There was probably a time in the distant past where Silicon Valley startups were funded too much too soon, and I think the ICO market is in the similar space,"" said Zooko Wilcox, founder of the Zcash Electric Coin Company, which manages the Zcash blockchain. Erik Voorhees, CEO of cryptocurrency exchange startup ShapeShift, gave the most eloquent defense for the model onstage. His remarks showcase how the industry is defending the concept even while acknowledging that failures in the current environment are likely. ""You can have shares of a common endeavor that people would like to build, and to give immediate liquidity around that idea,"" Voorhees said, adding: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in BitOasis, Coinbase, Korbit, ShapeShift and Zcash.

                            Bitcoin's New Scaling 'Agreement': The Reaction                        ",Pete Rizzo & Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-new-scaling-agreement-reaction/,"A meeting of bitcoin startup executives and miners held this weekend has resulted in the publication of a new proposal for how the open-source project should be upgraded to support additional transaction capacity. Detailed in a Medium post published by investment firm Digital Currency Group today, the proposal was billed as an agreement that would make two changes toward this stated goal. The proposal was signed by more than 50 companies, and claims to have support from 83% of the network's miners – businesses that operate computers that secure the blockchain and add new transactions to it. First, it lowered the barrier for the activation of Segregated Witness, the long-stalled proposal put forward by Bitcoin Core developers in December 2015, to 80% of the network's mining power. Second, it stated that the undersigned businesses would agree to activate software that would upgrade bitcoin's block size to 2MB via a process known as a hard fork. DCG further called on companies, miners, users and developers to join the proposal via a dedicated web form that was provided in the post. The company wrote: Abra, Bitclub Network, Bitcoin.com, BitFury, Bitmain, BitPay, Blockchain, Bloq, Circle, RSK Labs and Xapo are said to be providing technical and engineering support to prepare for the upgrades, though their commitment was not further detailed. Notable, however, is the absence of developers making up the open-source development community Bitcoin Core. Blockstream, a company that funds two such developers, opted not to attend the meeting when it was announced in March, with Blockstream CEO Adam Back formally declining to participate on behalf of the startup. According to those involved, the proposal will use an idea put forth by RSK Labs developer Sergio Demian Lerner in early April, though it's notable that several developers rejected the proposal in following emails. (The idea has been floated many times before as well.) Speaking to CoinDesk, Lerner affirmed that the startup would play a role in the process, though he said he ""probably won't write"" the code that is eventually used. ""Our agreement is to audit that code,"" he said. No code was released in the announcement, and others were less clear about what technology would underlie the move. According to those involved, the process by which the measure would be approved involves miners augmenting coinbase transactions in new bitcoin blocks to signal their support, as soft forks are usually deployed. By signaling on ""bit"", miners would be voicing their approval for a process by which SegWit would be activated at the time of a network fork. ""SegWit can activate immediately and the same bit will say in the future, at X date, a 2 MB hardfork happens, signaling two events with one bit,"" said Jeff Garzik, founder of bitcoin startup and proposal signatory Bloq. One of the more complex questions that resulted from the publication centers around just what it means exactly – and if it will really impact bitcoin's technical direction. Garzik put forth the strongest argument that it marks a significant departure from past proposals, namely because it finds new businesses funding technical efforts that will benefit the non-proprietary code. ""I think a mistake that every business has made is that they free-rode on Core,"" Garzik said. Others remarked similarly that the commitment might be real this time. Marshall Long, one of the leaders behind Bitcoin Classic, an early 2016 effort to increase bitcoin's block size, argued that the ""field of communication"" is improved over previous efforts. In particular, he referenced a 2016 agreement between a subset of miners and developers, colloquially termed ""The Hong Kong Agreement"", which originally committed to a timetable that would see both the activation of the SegWit code upgrade and the development of a 2MB hard fork. Ultimately, both timelines were missed. ""We've seen this before, so it has a less likely chance of turning out the same way. The recent history, the Hong Kong agreement is so fresh, something will happen good or bad,"" Long told CoinDesk. Still, Blockstream CSO Samson Mow, whose firm did not sign the proposal, noted that, like with other fork proposals, there is disagreement that it represents a significant enough majority to impact the network's direction. ""The technical community and a big swath of users have already said that a hard fork is not needed now,"" Mow said, adding: Chaincode developer Matt Corallo had a similar view. ""I’m somewhat disappointed that all of the feedback given by folks who’ve worked on the bitcoin protocol was completely ignored,"" he said in the DCG chat group. ""[I] suggest much more technically realistic ways to accomplish the same goal."" Others commented on the somewhat messy sociology behind the positioning, given that bitcoin users have been so firmly entrenched along partisan lines – with those supporting so-called ""off-chain scaling"" solutions on one, and those backing ""on-chain scaling"" solutions that would increase the hard-coded block size on the other. For example, Bloq economist Paul Storzc, whose startup is supporting the proposal, noted that he wasn't sure exactly what the compromise was. ""People wanted SegWit on the small block side, but the small block side thought the big block side would also like it because it's getting larger blocks, so it was unclear there would be any sentiment against it,"" he explained. Still, he noted that the activation of SegWit as part of the deal would be unlikely to win over Bitcoin Core developers. ""It isn't a huge concession to the small blockers to activate SegWit. It was only being withheld to annoy them anyway in the first place,"" he remarked. Bitcoin miner Chandler Guo noted his belief that, if anything, the compromise is perhaps more out of necessity given frustration over the stagnation of the technology's development, and that in the end, there are perhaps no winners. In a roundabout analogy, he compared the deal to a ""beautiful girl"" who would finally need to marry an ""ugly man"" due to indecision. ""The beautiful girl was waiting and waiting, and they have to marry someone, it doesn't matter who. The beautiful girl has to finally marry someone,"" he said. Perhaps the most contentious part of the agreement is the commitment to a bitcoin hard fork within a certain timeframe. Yifu Guo, the founder of bitcoin mining firm Avalon (now Canaan), professed to skepticism that the timeline would be held. ""I'll believe it when I see it,"" he said. ""It's too fast, they don't have enough adoption."" Even with the agreement, Guo said, there are technical limitations to how fast such a solution could be tested. Asked if he thought it would be a success, he said: ""I don't believe that."" Others were also concerned about the six-month timeline as those backing the proposal would have to develop code, ensure that it has widespread agreement, and deploy it all before the deadline. ""I don’t think it’s very realistic. Six months is not long enough. Let’s put it like that,"" said bitcoin enthusiast Stefan Jespers, who goes by the moniker 'WhalePanda'. He mentioned that it took developers six months to develop SegWit, and that it takes a long time for nodes to upgrade, offering recent bitcoin client versions as examples. ""You know the expression 'honey badger doesn't care' in bitcoin?"" said Jespers. ""People are going to oppose it, because it seems like they're being forced into it. Even if 80% of the miners support it, then what do the other 20% want to do?"" He added that he feels many developers and users don't support a block size parameter increase, and that their voices were excluded from the agreement. The fact that a range of scaling proposals have been put forth over the last year, with none ultimately reaching full agreement from the bitcoin community, meant there was also a notable skepticism of the proposal. Still, some argue that it's at least a path forward. ShapeShift CEO and co-founder Erik Voorhees, one of the companies that signed the agreement, told CoinDesk: There were also strong enthusiasts of the measure due to the perception that fees on the network are escalating with the bitcoin blockchain's increasing use. Here, a variety of perspectives diverged, most of them stemming from disagreements on how economic costs of the network should function and who should pay those costs. Garzik, for example, stressed the pain that he believes users are feeling, stating the proposal ""actually addresses a problem facing the user community"". He told CoinDesk: Elsewhere, comments underscored a key divide in the argument, whether the bitcoin network should even adapt to the needs of startups. Paul Puey, CEO and co-founder of wallet provider Airbitz, said he is in ""full support” of the proposal due to the pain his firm has experienced of late, despite the fact that his startup had not signed the pledge at press time. As a wallet operator, its customers and the company itself have been feeling the strain of the higher transaction fees, and it's due to an upgrade that they have no control over. ""All of those people who think this is okay, that bitcoin doesn't support many transactions in volume. I think they’re horribly wrong,"" Puey said. ""I’m all for pushing forward something at this point."" Others disagreed, with Blockstream's Ben Gorlick stating that SegWit offers a clear benefit for transaction capacity. ""What is being used right now is an attempt at a compromise. They're saying it as an excuse to fork. They're saying, let's take this thing that seems certain to everyone and they're creating a false majority,"" he stated. Gorlick's statements also hinted at another side effect of the proposal – the fact that action without broad agreement could risk splitting the bitcoin network in two. The 'contentious hard fork' aspect, which could result in two chains if not everyone agrees, is partly what's held back previous proposals so far. Some, such as Mow, think that this outcome could hold up this proposal as well. Others say that it's a risk worth taking. ""That is a risk. But the risk of bitcoin stagnating because everyone's getting fed up with it is also a risk. The latter is becoming a much bigger problem in my opinion,"" Voorhees said. Lightning Network creator Joseph Poon said he isn't supporting either side, but that from his past participation in negotiations, he believes the proposal puts the network on a path to a split that could result in two bitcoin blockchains. Poon told CoinDesk: And, what will happen if it does? In a Consensus 2017 panel yesterday, BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said that as he thinks that the market should decide which blockchain is the one that would be called 'bitcoin'. He suggested that BitPay will ultimately choose to support both bitcoins for a time, even if he thinks one will ultimately win out. In remarks, Digital Currency Group CEO Barry Silbert acknowledged that different users of the bitcoin network could go separate ways as a result of the deal, though he stated his belief that this outcome was increasingly likely before the meeting and proposal. Others said that the economics of the network won't support such an outcome. ""There will be two bitcoins with two market prices, they will sum up to what they have before,"" Storzc said. ""One will be worth more than the other, and the one that is smaller won't be enough for miners to run profitably."" While the ethereum blockchain underwent a split, commentators remarked that the unique design of bitcoin – it takes longer for the difficulty to reset, for example – means that this might not happen the same way. Even if miners with spare hardware were to support a fork, Peter Rizun, developer for the alternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Unlimited, expressed his doubts that two chains could continue. ""The technical problem of keeping the chain alive. Old miners will mine that, but they'll never find the block,"" he said. ""I don't think people realize how long the minority chain will struggle."" Others continued the familiar refrain that this outcome is unlikely. Economics aside, there may be technical hold-ups to efforts to change bitcoin. ""I think the people [behind the agreement] pushing for the fork are not really the majority so they won't do it,"" said Ferdinando Ametrano, a professor at Politecnico di Milano.

""Bitcoin Beyond $20 Billion: Digital Currency's Future,"" it read – but with bitcoin trading at close to $2300, the market cap of the currency is already $37 billion and climbing, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). During their appearance on the Consensus 2017 main stage today, both Smith and Voorhees shared their thoughts on why bitcoin is performing so well as an asset right now – and what we can expect from the future. The two perhaps have a unique vantage point to view the market: Voorhees runs a digital currency exchange while Smith leads one of the industry's longest-running wallet offerings. For his part, Voorhees made the argument that market participants ought to brace themselves, and grow accustomed to a cycle of highs and lows. ""People should expect bubbles with cryptocurrencies. They have been with us since the beginning of time and in crypto they are especially pronounced,"" he said. But how high will it go? According to Smith, bitcoin has only two options: soar to great heights, or crash and burn. He told the audience: As might be expected, the topic of why the market is behaving the way it is emerged as a central conversation point. Smith threw out a couple optimistic views. It could be an indication that the functionality and usability of the currency is finally built out in a way that encourages adoption. Or, he suggested, bitcoin may be experiencing a secondary lift from the money that has been being plowed into token sales. Voorhees, on the other hand, refused to identify a single driver for the price. ""Prices tend to move because hundreds of thousands or millions of actors are making millions of individual different decisions. And we don’t know what all those are. This is a complex system,"" he said. Both, however, agreed that regulation will be one of the most determining factors that shape the extent to which bitcoin and the broader constellation of cryptocurrencies evolve. Voorhees for his part, called for a hands-off regulatory stance, holding up the Internet as a somewhat idealized example of unfettered innovation. ""[The internet's] only powerful and important because of the freedom it brought, because of how little it was touched by regulators. That was the best thing that happened to let the internet boom. And that's what I want to happen with bitcoin,"" said Voorhees, who also went on to dismiss the idea that anyone but billionaires could hold sway over regulators. But if bitcoin is to deliver financial inclusion across diverse markets and cultures, regulators will necessarily have a role, argued Smith. ""How do we get to a place where our industry is inclusive and creates better, freer markets for the whole world?"" he said, concluding: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in ShapeShift.  Image by Morgen Peck for CoinDesk

At Consensus 2017 today, Abigail Johnson, chair and CEO of Fidelity Investments, went public with her enthusiasm for blockchain technology, bitcoin, ethereum and what the future holds for both open-source, public blockchains and more private alternatives. In her talk, Johnson discussed the ""future scenario"" where blockchain technologies have thrived, remarking that she thinks this has a ""reasonable chance"" of coming to pass despite the relative newness of the technology. Elsewhere, she argued how collaboration is needed to overcome this unfamiliarity with the technology and help it reach its ""full potential"". ""This transformation could complement lots of other innovative areas that we see emerging – including the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. These platforms shouldn't develop in a vacuum,"" she said. Johnson went on to tell attendees: Johnson also revealed information about her company's partners on its journey, naming blockchain startup Axoni, investment firm Boost VC and university initiatives based out of MIT, University College London and Cornell. To date, Johnson explained that Fidelity Labs, its internal R&D division has also set up experiments for bitcoin micropayments and even run bitcoin and ethereum mining operations in the spirit of learning more about the technology. Further, she revealed that Fidelity will be taking some conservative steps to expose Fidelity's customers more to the industry, announcing that customers will soon be able to see Coinbase holdings on Fidelity.com. Already, she said, this feature is available to employees who own digital currencies available through the startup's services. Speaking to this coming together of both existing finance and startups, Johnson said: Johnson further detailed Fidelity's research strategy for blockchain, noting the education difficulties that have thus far made adoption difficult. She said that, at this stage, most potential users attempt to compare it to older technologies, or they simply never adopt due to the time and patience it takes to master new concepts such as having passwords for money. ""Some users treated the recovery phrase like a password. They also expected to be able to click a 'Forgot My Password' button if they ever lost it – definitely not the ideal mental model,"" she said. Johnson also spoke to the larger ideological changes that have happened as the world has begun to better understand open, public blockchain technology, and how that is reshaping how industries are seeking to apply it to business models. ""If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point-of-sale today, you are going to be disappointed,"" she remarked. Johnson's talk also covered other problems in how blockchain technology is being applied in the enterprise – specifically, regulation, scalability and privacy. ""Regulators will go through the same growing pains. And, in order for this technology to reach its true potential, we need solutions that protect customer interests,"" she said. Notably, Johnson also addressed that her passion for open-source blockchain technologies is also hitting governance roadblocks that limit their utility for enterprises. ""Companies that build products on these platforms don’t have clarity about the future path they might take – or how to influence these communities,"" she said. Still, she cautioned that the traditional financial world – despite its consortiums – hasn't quite figured it out either, remarking: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase and Axoni.  Image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk

Unveiled today by BitPay chief commercial officer Sonny Singh at Consensus 2017, the Visa-branded offering enables users to top up its BitPay Prepaid Visa Card with dollars using cryptocurrency, which can then be spent as euros, British pounds or US dollars at merchants around the globe. ""This will be the first prepaid debit card that will be available in 131 countries,"" BitPay CEO Stephen Pair said in interview. As such, the announcements marks perhaps the boldest execution on an idea that has been pursued by bitcoin-focused startups since 2014. But while early attempts at executing on the idea were met with setbacks, Pair said its partnership with Visa would ease issues. Pair continued: So far, BitPay reports that 15,000 cards from its domestic product, unveiled last year at Consensus 2016, have been ordered. Further, the startup reported that it has seen growing demand for an international version of the offering since last year. ""We have a waiting list of over 20,000 people who have asked,"" BitPay marketing and communications manager James Walpole told CoinDesk. ""This provides a lot of value, especially in emerging markets where bitcoin is used for real-world payments."" Still, the product launch notably come at a time when some projects and startups formerly using the bitcoin blockchain as a payment rail have begun to adopt other solutions due to escalating network fees. (As transaction volumes have grown, the hard-coded limit on block size has effectively created a market for space on the bitcoin ledger).  But while Circle, another payments-focused startup, migrated to a new platform unveiled in December, Pair appeared less interested in this idea, stating that BitPay needs a ""cryptocurrency that is secure, liquid and sufficiently scalable"". ""We're committed to one blockchain in the long term, but if there's a problem with that network, we'd evaluate some other currency or a fork of the bitcoin blockchain,"" he stated. Users have to pay the associated bitcoin network transaction fees to load the BitPay Prepaid Visa Card, but the BitPay team stressed the utility of its product and the benefits of cryptocurrency would be enough to override those concerns. Founded in 2011, BitPay is one of the longest-operating bitcoin startups, having raised just over $30m in three public funding rounds.

                            Consensus 2017: BitPay CEO Calls Bitcoin Fork 'Only Option' For Businesses                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/consensus-2017-bitpay-ceo-bitcoin-fork/,"BitPay's chief executive made the case for a fork at the bitcoin scaling discussion panel at CoinDesk's Consensus 2017 conference today. Centered on a two-year debate focusing on the size of transaction blocks on the bitcoin network, global discussion on the issue has so far passed through a few phases with varying proposals to increase the throughput of the system being put forward along the way. Most recently, investment firm Digital Currency Group advanced a proposal that would see the Segregated Witness upgrade activate and start a countdown to a 2MB block size increase – though, a similar idea has been proposed and rejected by developers before. As this debate has been raging for a couple of years now, members of the scaling panel were quick to note their frustration. Payment processor BitPay, for one, has been toying with different options in search of a solution, a path that has included the exploration of alternative implementations. Stephen Pair, the company's CEO, went as far as to call for a fork that would end in two bitcoins. Pair said: ""Long-term we need one chain that's liquid and secure. But for a while we might run two versions of bitcoin to see which one works out,"" he added later, arguing that the market should decide which version ultimately prevails. Not everyone agreed that this is the best way forward. ""Nobody that I've talked to wants chain to split. I don't think there will be,"" said Peter Rizun, chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, another bitcoin client that has been the center of the bitcoin debate for the past year or so. The DCG proposal was also raised during the panel, with Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo calling the proposal a ""logistics nightmare"" – but chatter on that subject was quickly derailed. In a way, the panel showcased the many dimensions of the debate. Much of the discussion that took place centered on what role users on the bitcoin network play. One of the more recent developments in the scaling debate is a proposed effort known as a ""user-activated soft fork"" (UASF), a mechanism that has been used in the past to push through a particular type of critical change to bitcoin (known as the ""consensus level""). Yet it didn't see much of the limelight until an unknown developer posted the idea as an alternative to the current mechanism, which requires near-universal support among miners. Advocates have been advancing the concept as a way to push SegWit across the finish line. It's not a change mechanism that everyone agree is safe, but some on the panel seemed open to the idea. In fact, Lombrozo put on a UASF hat several minutes into the panel. ""We don't have to stay on the same chain. That's the freedom and the right that everyone has. Including the user-activated soft fork. I would never say that you can't do that,"" Pair said, agreeing that users have options. Still, the panel itself demonstrated how the debate has grown even more complex over time, with alternative implementations like Unlimited and Bcoin seeking a path forward. Bcoin is an alternative client that tries to solve the debate with an experimental technology that would effectively allow users to choose their own block size. Purse CEO Andrew Lee posited that Bcoin is a way to help diversify the community of developers in the bitcoin sphere, which he believes has been monopolized by one implementation, Bitcoin Core. Despite all the new developments and proposals, though, moderator Jameson Lopp argued that users should expect this kind of debate for the long haul, concluding: Disclosures: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group.

                            RSK Raises $3.5 Million, Launches Bitcoin Smart Contract Testnet                        ",Amy Castor,https://www.coindesk.com/opening-testnet-to-public-rsk-announces-3-5m-funding/,"Bitcoin, long recognized for its stability and security, tends to falls short when it comes to newer innovations. Meanwhile, smart contracts platform ethereum is drawing increasingly more attention. But what if you could combine those two networks and come up with the best of both worlds? That is what blockchain startup RSK Labs has long sought to do. The company’s blockchain solution, RSK (or Rootstock), aims to draw on the strengths of the bitcoin network, while bringing new options, like flexible smart contracts, into the picture. A little more than a year ago, the Buenos Aires-based company received $1m in seed funding to create a functioning testnet. But, to move forward with its technical plans, more cash was needed. To that end, RSK Labs announced today at Consensus 2017, that it has received an additional $3.5m in pre-Series A funding. This latest round comes in the form of contributions from a long list of supporters, including, Anthony Di Iorio, CEO of Decentral and Jaxx, and bitcoin mining firms such as Bitfury and Bitmain. According to RSK executives, the company plans to put that money toward R&D, increasing the network's security and deploying a mainnet in a few months. Also during Consensus, the company announced that it will be opening its production testnet (called Ginger) to the public, so that more users can begin building and testing out their own smart contracts on the platform. Gabriel Kurman, co-founder of RSK, told CoinDesk: At this point, you're probably wondering how the platform works. Put simply, RSK is a two-way pegged sidechain that grafts smart contract functionality onto the bitcoin network. It also introduces an off-chain protocol for claimed ""near-instant"" payments. As an idea, sidechains were originally put forth in a proposal by cryptographer and Blockstream CEO Adam Back and others in 2014 as a bid to extend the functions of bitcoin. That proposal came at a time when many were frustrated with bitcoin’s inability to keep up with newer innovations. So, as a sidechain, RSK is an independent blockchain. However, it does not have its own token, relying instead on bitcoin for its currency. RSK does this by pegging, or matching, its smart token to bitcoin, so that the value of an RSK token is exactly that of a bitcoin. Also, users (and this is the 'two-way' part) can freely move their tokens back and forth between the two chains. Essentially, a user's bitcoin goes into a type of reserve where it is locked up, and then used to back the RSK token, known as smartBTC. You can think of it as putting your bitcoin into a checking account, and then using the RSK network to spend that money. But RSK goes further than simply giving users a new set of tokens to spend – it also adds smart contract capabilities to bitcoin. Bitcoin already allows users to create simple smart contracts, like multisig, which requires two or more users to sign off on a payment before it can be released. But RSK takes that to another level, with Turing-complete smart contract capabilities that go head-to-head with ethereum's offerings. RSK also addresses another short coming of the bitcoin network: its ability to scale. According to the company's website, RSK currently achieves 400 payment transactions per second, compared to bitcoin, which only handles only around seven. However, the goal is to eventually push that to 2,000 transactions per second using a second layer technology, which the company calls Lumino. Outlined in this white paper, the Lumino Network is an off-chain payment system that relies a protocol known as the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP). Lumino is touted as being similar to the Lightning Network, a popular scaling solution originally designed for bitcoin, currently being tested on litecoin. Moving forward, the company faces two main challenges. One is how it will peg its token to the bitcoin blockchain. Tether, another sidechain company, made news earlier this year when it lost its peg to the US dollar, creating a large price spread between exchanges that quote actual dollars and those that quote tether tokens. So, RSK will need to prove to the community that it can hold onto its peg and not undermine the value of its token. Securing the network is another issue. In order for the RSK chain to be secure, a majority of bitcoin miners need to 'merge mine' the chain. And that requires the permission and active assistance of 50% of all the bitcoin mining pools. Merge mining is a technology that allows a miner to mine more than one blockchain at a time. The miner’s computing power contributes to the total hashrate of both cryptocurrencies, and the miner gains block rewards for both networks. According to RSK, its network is currently supported by bitcoin miners representing more than 55% of bitcoin's total hashing power. In addition, the company claims that more miners, accounting for 30% of the hashrate, have expressed their support for RSK and will start merge mining within the next few months. If RSK can overcome those challenges, it stands to introduce some much-needed features to bitcoin, as well as help build a worthy alternative to the ethereum virtual machine.

                            History is Made: Bitcoin Prices Top $2,000 to Set New All-Time High                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/history-made-bitcoin-prices-top-2000-set-new-time-high/," The price of bitcoin surpassed $2,000 for the first time in history today, pushing the cryptocurrency to a fresh, new record amid rising trader interest. The currency's price rose as much as 2.62% during the session, according to CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) to hit a press time high of $2,019. By rising above $2,000, bitcoin's price has surged more than 100% this year and nearly 125% since hitting an annual low of $891.51 in late March. Now that the the digital currency has surpassed this key, psychological level of $2,000, it could experience some significant tailwinds, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged digital currency platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk that should bitcoin prices ""convincingly"" surpass $2,000, ""the rate of price appreciation will accelerate dramatically"". Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, also weighed in on the importance of this price level, stating: Speaking of interest, analysts generally agreed that bitcoin's rise above $2,000 could spur significant attention from the media. Hayes offered similar sentiment, stating that a sustained rise above $2,000 would prompt every major financial media outlet to cover bitcoin. In spite of all this visibility, Hayter cautioned that sometimes, the ""lack of sophistication"" that goes along with mainstream media coverage ""can be dangerous as it snowballs momentum."" Interestingly enough, Google Trends data has thus far shown that online searches for the word ""bitcoin"" have still not recovered to the all-time high they set in December 2013, but they are getting closer. While a figure of 100 represents the highest point for these searches, the metric stood at 85 at the time of report.  While many agreed that bitcoin's rise above $2,000 would spur greater media coverage, the factors that drove the currency's price above this level seemed a bit more complex. One development that has coincided with bitcoin's sharp price gains over the last several months is the rising interest of traders, as measured by trading volume at major exchanges. Earlier this month, both Kraken and Poloniex announced that they were experiencing surging transaction activity. Kraken indicated that on 5th May, trading volume across all digital assets surpassed $178m, setting an all-time high and beating the prior record by 25%.  Poloniex expressed similar sentiment, saying in a statement that: Another factor that has helped drive bitcoin prices is the rising influence of Japan in the bitcoin markets, where the technology is now regulated. The Japanese yen is the single largest currency being exchanged for bitcoin, accounting for more than 45% of the money flow into bitcoin at the time of report, according to CryptoCompare data. The US dollar came in a relatively distant second, making up approximately 30% of the money flowing into bitcoin, according to additional CryptoCompare figures. This increase in the use of the Japanese yen comes after Japan moved to formally recognize bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting 1st April. The country's lawmakers enacted legislation that both classified the cryptocurrency as a type of prepaid payment instrument and also caused it to fall under anti-money laundering and know-your-customer rules. Bitcoin prices have even been rising sharply in spite of the cryptocurrency's ongoing scaling dilemma, an ongoing issue with its transaction capacity that members of the bitcoin community have been trying to resolve. Developers could address this problem by increasing block size, increasing the number of transactions that can fit into an individual block through Segregated Witness, or both. Thus far, the bitcoin network has failed to rally the support needed to bring about any such changes. Still, bitcoin markets seem unhindered by the scaling dilemma, and Hayes spoke to this development: Rocket icon via Shutterstock

                            Where is Gavin Andresen? The Quiet Exile of Bitcoin's Former Face                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/where-is-gavin-andresen-the-quiet-exile-of-bitcoins-former-face/,"You could almost see a baffled 'WTF' come across Eric Lombrozo’s face as he watched Gavin Andresen at CoinDesk's Consensus 2016 conference. The man many people saw as the leader of the bitcoin community, or at least a kind of elder statesman, Andresen had just affirmed that he was standing behind Craig Wright's claim that he was the cryptocurrency's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto. ""It was a very bizarre moment,"" Lombrozo, a Bitcoin Core developer since 2011 recalls.  Lombrozo was not alone in that thinking. Andresen's announcement onstage was a bombshell that caused a commotion for the rest of the event with both community members and reporters, most of whom had dreamt about uncovering that story for years. But that confirmation would never come. Namely, because the overwhelming consensus from the technical community was, as Lombrozo put it: ""There is absolutely no way he's Satoshi."" For Andresen – a man so well-liked, so looked-up to, yet so resistant to his leadership role within the bitcoin community – to make this rash assumption in public with everyone watching, seemed curious, if not embarrassing. As interviews reveal, however, it had deeper effects. What might seem like a harmless comment to some would do much to shake perceptions of Andresen among the very group of people he was supposedly leading. Just like the cryptocurrency itself, Andresen found himself in the spotlight nearly overnight, at least as it relates to any mainstream celebrity status. Graduating from Princeton with a computer science degree in 1988, he developed software for a number of companies before landing on a full-time role working on bitcoin alongside Satoshi Nakamoto in December 2010. Before this, though, he focused his career on 3D graphics and virtual reality modeling. From there, he dedicated his life to advancing public perception of bitcoin (at various points explaining it to the CIA and giving out by today's value thousands of dollars in bitcoin via a public website). Andresen proved effective in enlisting other developers in working on the open-source software protocol. Then, around early October 2013, the price per bitcoin started rising pretty quickly, from $133 on the first to more than $1,200 two months later. There were glowing articles about his involvement, and as the industry grew from a swelling of investment in 2013 and 2014, he took positions as an advisor at key companies and a full-time position at the Bitcoin Foundation, the nascent industry's once-prominent advocacy group. Andresen as the face – at least the unmasked face – of bitcoin became a minor celebrity. And everyone wanted to know the backstory. The persistent narrative that came from these inquiries was that, when Satoshi Nakamoto left the project, he happily handed the work over to Andresen. But Lombrozo, and other developers, think the tale is a bit embellished. Sure, he said, Andresen deserves credit for bringing cryptographers and developers together to build the project, but Satoshi didn't really hand over the reins, he/she/they/it simply disappeared, they say. The more romantic version of the story gave Andresen even more clout. As more developers began working on the code and more venture-backed startups began building applications for the protocol emerged, Andresen still had a significant amount of influence over the path of the world's first decentralized cryptocurrency. In an article titled, ""The Man Who Really Built Bitcoin"" from August 2014, MIT Technology Review conceded that, although there was infighting about the best way to scale the bitcoin protocol to handle more than seven transactions a second, ""One way or another, whatever Andresen decides on will probably get done."" Yet, as a decentralized, open-source project, many developers who joined bitcoin perhaps weren't predisposed to such notions of hierarchy. As it may be, one of the most misunderstood aspects of bitcoin is what a massive technical project it is, one that involves collaboration from a large group of interested parties and near-constant mundane tasks like code de-bugging. And as an outgrowth of the scaling debate, bitcoin has even come to encompass differing developer groups, working on competing implementations of the code. A developer like Peter Todd may specialize in asking hard questions about other developers' ideas (trolling for the sake of improving ideas), while others like Matt Corallo specialize in training new developers. (Although these are far from something like traditional formal jobs.) Further, Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival group of developers, is able to work on wholly different fixes that aim to make changes to the network. As the lead maintainer for the project, Andresen played a key role in facilitating this work in bitcoin's early days. Today, development is overseen by Wladimir van der Laan (employed by MIT), but startups Chaincode Labs is the largest single supporter of Bitcoin Core development. MIT employs two full-time developers, while Blockstream supports Pieter Wuille and Greg Maxwell. Some members of Core don't have any relationship to a startup or company, others do. Yet, they're all united by an active, and public, mailing list that serves as the basis for formal discussion on project ideas. It's perhaps a clash of cultures then that came to a head the day Andresen took the stage at the Marriott Marquis in New York and vouched for Wright. Not a week later, Andresen's ability to make changes to code had been revoked. Behind the scenes, Andresen and the other developers had also started butting heads about other things. Wladimir van der Laan, Bitcoin Core's lead developer and maintainer, told CoinDesk, that even before Andresen turned the position over to him, he had been doing most of the ""maintainer tasks"". His statements, and those of others, paint a portrait of someone increasingly divorced from the day-to-day efforts that kept the project up and running 24/7. ""Not only was [Andresen] not writing code, he wasn't discussing on the developer IRC nor on GitHub, nor reviewing code,"" Van der Laan said.  While internally, Andresen had passed his leadership role onto Van der Laan, externally, Lombrozo said: ""[H]e still paraded himself around as the leader, as someone that had control."" And this is where things really went sour. How Andresen saw his influence within the Core developer community was evident during a 2015 CoinScrum event in London, where Mike Hearn, a former Core contributor, and Andresen spoke about the continuing block size contention. ""A lot of people are pushing me to be more of a dictator,"" Andresen said, as Hearn took a swig of a beer and pointed at himself. There was discussion then from an audience member about calling his role something other than ""dictator"", such as ""traffic cop"" or ""decision maker"". Andresen suggested ""ice breaker"". Then Andresen continued: This authoritarian statement seemed strange to participants in a community building a decentralized protocol that's always touted its imperviousness to control by any one person, group of people or state. According to Lombrozo, this event was only a month before Andresen started pushing for bigger blocks on his blog. And shortly after, when Corallo saw the posts, he brought it to the attention of the Core mailing list. After Corallo's post, Pieter Wuille, a Core developer since 2011 and co-founder of Blockstream, penned a response in support of increasing the block size, but wary about using Andresen's proposed method and hard forks. According to Lombrozo, Andresen was talking to bitcoin companies such as Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain and Xapo, selling them a solution to the block size limitation that hadn’t gone through any peer review. Yet, to those participating in bitcoin development, there were channels of communication where such fixes were supposed to be brought up. Bryan Bishop, a Core developer since 2014, said the Core team had sent Andresen multiple requests ""asking him to voluntarily step down from (mis)representing Bitcoin Core to the wider community"". ""The fact that he went around the whole system, and people thought he was trying to circumvent peer review; that upset everyone,"" Lombrozo said. ""It wasn't the block size thing really."" Although, it also kind of was. Because Andresen's plan for increasing the block size was met with resistance by the other Bitcoin Core developers. According to Lombrozo, that's because there were technical concerns with his proposal, but Andresen was not willing to listen. Instead, Andresen went back to those companies he had spoken with and told them the fix was simple but Core wasn't interested in helping. ""The problem was that he was misrepresenting himself as having some sort of special privilege in bitcoin development – but really anybody can show up and propose anything,"" Bishop said. Obviously, this caused tension. Not only that, but also there's the perception, which still remains a point of contention today, that the Core development team is stubborn and uninterested in helping bitcoin businesses and in turn extending bitcoin to more and more consumers around the world. (It's even perhaps an outgrowth of the feud that bitcoin developers are even bundled into differing groups – Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin Classic – at all.) Andresen created this ""expectation that a quick fix was there and that’s been a huge point of frustration,"" Lombrozo said. According to Lombrozo, no one knew how pervasive Andresen’s involvement was with advising startups and at least he thought most bitcoin companies had executives following Core communication channels for updates. ""To be honest, it caught me a little by surprise,"" he said. ""Although, in hindsight it's obvious, there were tons of flags everywhere."" Bishop seconded that: The blog Bishop mentioned was Andresen's own, where he sometimes conveniently skirted issues the Bitcoin Core mailing list was discussing. This, something most people would find aggravating, though, Bishop analyzed more pragmatically. ""Security work requires very careful review and analysis,"" he said. ""When you bypass peer review, you're going to miss a lot of bugs and incompatibilities."" Could money have been involved as some in the community have suggested? Andresen was getting paid by the Bitcoin Foundation and held advisory roles at startups. ""I don't know [Andresen's] main motivation but he was trying to make a career out of advising companies in the bitcoin space,"" said Lombrozo. ""And he was sort of telling them what they wanted to hear, that scaling was possible and easy, because why tell them it was going to take a long time and be complicated, right?"" He continued: ""And that came back to bite him pretty hard."" According to Lombrozo, though, some Core developers and the group’s supporters took unpopular stances that the block size should never be raised, but that wasn't the pervasive sentiment. Core had trouble abating that idea, though, since Andresen who had been the frontman for the corporates and public for some time had already passed the torch to a much less public Van der Laan. Not to mention, Lombrozo went on, explaining the issues was difficult in that it required an in-depth knowledge of the protocol to understand the trade-offs. Plus, he said, the way some Core developers and its supporters reacted was less than ideal, many times brash, if not stooping to the level of personal attacks. Especially on the Core team's communication channels, which didn’t scale well as the community expanded rapidly. So off Andresen went, joining forces with Hearn, who's now a developer at bank-focused blockchain consortium, R3, to push an alternative implementation called Bitcoin XT. ""That was the beginning of the politicization,"" lamented Lombrozo. Bishop agrees, saying, the narrative that 'Core doesn't listen' is easily discounted by the fact that anyone can send any of the Core developers an email at any time. ""The reason for the 'Core doesn't listen' idea is because lots of people were too busy talking in secret with Andresen,"" Bishop said. ""And he didn't really bridge the communication gap with the developers."" Although, Lombrozo doesn't think Andresen intended for that politicization to turn into the big mess that it has today (Lombrozo is still cordial with Andresen), there's no doubt the issue is one of the biggest on the table for the now eight-year-old digital currency protocol. While Andresen’s moves seem to have caused an unstoppable rift in the bitcoin community, some Core developers have reached out ""to extend an olive branch"". ""I would prefer him to be more aligned in working together with people,"" said a Core developer that wanted to remain anonymous. “But realistically that’s probably not going to happen."" Andresen, the developer said, is still friendly, but there’s an awkwardness now and many Core developers hold grudges because of the perception that he betrayed, if not completely sold out, the team. And everything seemed to implode that summer day on the stage at Consensus. “I don’t know,” said Lombrozo, in response to inquiries about Andresen’s belief in Wright. ""From what I’ve heard, Wright is a very charming, magician sort of guy. I haven’t met him myself, but I know others who have and they say he’s a really good con man."" According to folks in the bitcoin community, Wright invited Andresen, likely because Andresen had influence over the community, to London and convinced him he was Satoshi. For someone that's spent years working on the bitcoin protocol, even interacting with a masked Satoshi during the early years, it seems odd that Andresen would fall for a scam. But Lombrozo suspects Andresen wasn’t complicit in any scam, but instead just got tricked. Van der Laan agrees, saying it was a ""confidence scam"" Andresen fell for. ""That can happen, but even confronted with evidence he kept saying Wright was Satoshi,"" he said. ""For that reason we decided to remove him from the development team."" Van der Laan concluded: Since the Wright debacle, Andresen has been weirdly absent from bitcoin news. Via email, Andresen himself said, ""I've been avoiding getting myself into any press lately, and that's been going well so I'm going to keep doing that."" Although, in recent months he’s been tweeting more than usual about the block size debate. He's also a co-signer of a still unreleased bitcoin scaling proposal being put forward by Digital Currency Group founder Barry Silbert. ""He keeps repeating the 'block size must increase' line without being involved in any innovations that are happening,"" said Van der Laan. In a follow-up email, Andresen did offer some confirmation on the blockchain-focused jobs he was last known to be working. He resigned, not only from the Bitcoin Foundation, but also MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative early in the year. R3’s Hearn said in an email, “The last time I talked to Gavin, he wanted to disconnect from the blockchain/cryptocurrency space and spend more time working with his local community.” Other than keeping an interested eye on the block size debate, though, Andresen was advising some cryptocurrency projects and involved in zcash to a certain extent, all while working on a stealth project. This stealth project people referenced might be the Random Sanity Project Andresen tweeted about at the beginning of this month. The project, perhaps owing to the continued debate about Andresen himself, was met with both praise and skepticism on Twitter and Reddit.

                            Bitcoin is Just $100 Away From Doubling its Price in 2017                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-100-doubling-price-2017/," The price of bitcoin has hit a new high on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), reaching an $1,902 average across global exchanges. While one in a string of new all-time highs the digital currency has so far set in 2017, this one is perhaps notable as it means the price is now within striking distance of $2,000, a figure that would effectively find the asset doubling in value in 2017. Bitcoin traded for just over $1,000 on 1st January, but has edged up sharply amid increasing media exposure for its technology and those in the wider blockchain tech sector. Indeed, on at least two exchanges – Poloniex and Bitfinex – the price was even hovering just over $1,960. Year-over-year, the price of bitcoin is up 300%, having risen to $1,900, up from $453 on 18th May, 2016. At press time, bitcoin's market capitalization (the value of all bitcoins in existence) was $31bn. Still, the move comes amid a broader boost in the cryptocurrency market, which broke the $60bn barrier today. The increase has taken place amid strong surges from Ripple's XRP, which seeks to lower costs in enterprise cross-border payments, and ethereum's ether token, a cryptographic asset that powers its decentralized app network.

In a letter dated 17th March, Senator Orrin Hatch, along with Reps. Kevin Brady and Vern Buchanan, took aim at the IRS, questioning the basis of its investigation and requesting information about its broader strategy on digital currencies. The letter was addressed to IRS commissioner John Koskinen. Hatch is the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. Brady is the chair of the House of Representatives Committee on Ways and Means, while Buchanan leads that body's Oversight Subcommittee. The three wrote: The move comes months after the IRS sough to to compel Coinbase to produce the records, a court effort that began in November. At the time, the IRS said it was seeking information about the startup's bitcoin customers as part of an effort to prevent potential tax avoidance. The IRS declared digital currencies a taxable form of property in 2014. Since the IRS first went to court, both Coinbase and one of its customers moved to stifle the effort. The tax agency later asked another judge to approve its initial summons, and earlier this week, a pair of Coinbase customers (who are seeking anonymity) asked a federal judge in California to halt the tax agency's summons. According to the letter, the three members of Congress are seeking info about the IRS strategy on digital currencies – which its own watchdog has criticized as deficient and in need of an overhaul – as well as the justifications for its effort against Coinbase. The group said it wants answers before 7th June. Notably, the three also asked whether the IRS would take a more hands-off approach to digital currencies in order to facilitate adoption. ""Will the IRS consider a de minimis exemption or other action to remove practical obstacles to such moderate, transactional use of digital currencies?"" the letter stated.

Maxwell has been appointed to lead Blockchain's global communications team. Before joining Uber in May 2014, Maxwell had been working as a White House staffer since 2010, and, prior to that, served as a senior account executive at the San Francisco-based BergDavis Public Affairs, according to her LinkedIn bio. Blockchain’s second new exec is Xen Baynham-Herd, who has been brought on to become the company's lead economist, focusing on new initiatives for the brand. Baynham-Herd previously worked as a director at the London office of Swiss investment bank UBS. The new appointments demonstrate Blockchain's continued interest in tapping premier executive talent for its operations, following the addition of former Barclays Bank group chief executive Antony Jenkins to its board of directors last December.

                            The World Is Watching: Can WannaCry's Creators Cash Out Their Bitcoin Ransom?                        ",Amy Castor,https://www.coindesk.com/the-world-is-watching-can-wannacrys-creators-cash-out-their-bitcoin-ransom/,"The hackers behind the infamous WannaCry ransomware have had a lucrative week. So far, they have racked up almost $80,000 in bitcoins. But their next step may be more difficult – they still have to figure out how to move that money, without giving themselves away to authorities. The well-publicized cyber-attack, which began in Asia, has locked up hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries. Once a computer gets infected, a tab pops up demanding a $300 payment in bitcoin to unfreeze the data. Shockingly, despite no clear evidence that anyone who pays the ransom actually receives the promised decryption keys to unlock their encrypted files, some people have been putting up the funds, sending their bitcoin off to one of the hacker's three bitcoin wallet addresses. But now, with the world's cybercrime teams watching those bitcoin addresses, the question is: Will the hackers be able to launder that money and spend it? Or, is the money tainted, traceable, and therefore worthless to the thieves? Originally bitcoin was touted as an anonymous payment vehicle. But over the years it has become clear that bitcoin is pseudonymous rather than truly anonymous. Bitcoin addresses, payments and transactions are all visible on the blockchain. And by analyzing transaction patterns, it is possible to trace money and find the actual parties behind the public keys – strings of numbers bitcoin uses to identify its participants.
 As WannaCry is the most widespread bitcoin ransomware attack in history, the criminals behind it have garnered a lot of attention. So, if they want to actually spend their funds, they will have to find a clever way to remove all links from the original bitcoin addresses. As of right now, though, the bitcoins are still sitting untouched, and the trail is cold. So what are the options for the bad actor(s) behind the ransomware attack? Laundering bitcoin is a little different from laundering fiat money, but is just a matter of applying the right tools, according to Emin Gün Sirer, a professor at Cornell University. According to him, technologies already exist for shedding so called ‘tainted’ bitcoins – they just require a little technical know-how. One of the simplest processes is ‘chain hopping', where bitcoins are converted into other digital currencies, usually at offshore exchanges. “Following the trail gets quite difficult as the coins cross jurisdictions and change shape,” Sirer told CoinDesk. Another technique known as ‘tumbling’ would allow the hackers to pool their ill-begotten bitcoins with other people's coins. In a bitcoin tumbling service, coins from different sources are mixed together and then re-disbursed. Conceivably, the hackers could repeatedly mix their coins until the coins were diluted enough to throw law officials off their path. But Ethan Heilman, the Boston University researcher behind TumbleBit, a proposed bitcoin tumbler, indicated that mixing bitcoin is risky business, especially when dealing with larger sums of money. As he pointed out, one of the problems the hackers may run into is finding a large enough number of bitcoins to adequately mix with. ""Even if they mix the coins such that they will be hard to follow, if the WannaCry hackers make a mistake and join the coins back together, those coins could become vulnerable to clustering and other blockchain analysis techniques,"" he said. Further, it is unclear how effective most mixers actually are, Heilman added. Notably, the fact that the hackers used only three bitcoin addresses to collect their money suggests they don't know much about bitcoin privacy. Had they used a unique bitcoin address for each computer WannaCry infected, the money would have been a lot more difficult to trace. In a LinkedIn post, Neil Walsh, the UN’s head of global cybercrime, pointed to that and other shortcomings in the ransomware to suggest the hackers are likely in over their heads. He wrote: However, as Sirer pointed out, hacking is a rich, stratified ecosystem, and the people who put together the exploit may now be looking for an expert at laundering coins. Or, they may simply be biding their time before attempting to retrieve the funds. He concluded: Hacker image via Shutterstock

As the exchange makes progress toward providing customers with the ability to make deposits and withdrawals, the spread between bitcoin prices on its order books and the various international exchanges has been on the decline. While the differential between Bitfinex and itBit neared $100 roughly a month ago, this gap was close to $50 at roughly 19:00 UTC, according to CryptoCompare data. The spreads were also very similar between the exchange and its US counterparts GDAX and Gemini. But while spreads were similar on the aforementioned exchanges, they varied quite a bit on other marketplaces. The price of bitcoin was very similar on Bitfinex and Poloniex, but it was roughly $30 lower on Kraken. In a few instances, spreads were far higher, reaching approximately $80 on OKCoin and surpassing $100 on BTC-e. Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to the situation, affirming that it's largely due to continued withdrawal limitations at China-based exchanges, though he noted others like BTC-e are still lower due to banking issues. He said: Still, compared to other exchanges, Bitfinex is showing signs its easing former concerns about its stability and solvency. Bitfinex has been working to overcome its difficulties in this area for the last several months. The exchange announced in April that it was having problems involving outbound USD wires and incoming wire transfers. Further, it continued to struggle with additional setbacks, announcing 20th April that it was encountering delays affecting its wire transfers. But Bitfinex appears to be taking a proactive approach to addressing these challenges, announcing 12th May that ""other channels have been slowly ramping up"" in an effort to provide customers with greater ability to make deposits and withdrawals.

At press time, the average bitcoin price across major exchanges was $1,808, up from an opening average of $1,718.20. The increase follows a correction earlier this week in which bitcoin fell to $1,650, and comes at a time at which the market for blockchain protocols is becoming more competitive. In particular, protocols like Ripple Consensus Ledger, developed by San Francisco startup Ripple for cross-border transactions, and ethereum, a blockchain for smart contracts, have begun to develop unique value propositions that appear to be winning investment dollars. Ripple's XRP token, for instance, is up nearly 6,000% on the year, while ethereum's ether token was up nearly 1,000%. The development has not gone unnoticed by exchange and brokerage operators.

Still in its earliest phases, the research is being headed by the director of analysis at the Center on Sanctions and Illicit Finance in Washington, DC, and crafted to gather data on how state actors might currently use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to evade sanctions. Contrary to some inflammatory calls to ban bitcoin, however, the research, being conducted by Yaya J Fanusie of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, is looking as much at how blockchain can help prevent illicit activity as how it can enable it. After spending seven years as both an economic and counter-terrorism analyst in the CIA, Fanusie told CoinDesk: The Foundation for the Defense of Democracies is a non-profit organization founded in 2001 to advise members of Congress, federal agencies, the US Treasury Department and other agencies about how to prevent terrorism around the world. Fanusie was hired in 2015, at which point he first began looking into the potential national security threats resulting from bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. At the time, he was skeptical that the mostly unverifiable claims were true. But when he discovered a known terrorist organization using Twitter to raise money for weapons, he intensified his research. Then last month, CoinDesk reported that the Swedish government had incorporated a venture capital firm that would begin investing in Iran using the payment method. By using bitcoin to incorporate in Sweden which, along with the rest of Europe, has a more relaxed policy on sanctions against Iran, the startup, Brave New World Investments, is helping pave the way for what could end up being a legal way for some to circumvent US sanctions. But, according to Fanusie, the potential threat should not be exaggerated. ""Bitcoin by itself is not going to compensate for all the outlets that are cut off,"" he said, adding: Similarly, Fanusie sought to temper the escalating concerns being circulated in the media about bitcoin being used as part of the 'WannaCry' ransomware attacks, in which an estimated 200,000 victims were asked to pay bitcoin to regain access to encrypted computer files. Instead of focusing on the potential threat that bitcoin might pose, Fanusie said the hacks are more evidence of how bitcoin enables ""transactions which financial authorities can’t interdict"". ""This is not illicit in itself,"" said Fanusie. ""It's just a more recent and increasingly more common way of transacting that serves anyone looking for alternative payment methods."" In the future, he said that cyber forensics investigations into more traditional online crime will likely need to happen ""in tandem"" with investigations of blockchain itself. Fanusie said: In its infancy, blockchain technology, which makes middlemen less necessary (or not necessary at all), was developed out of ""desire for freedom"" according to Fanusie. ""A desire for more of a democratic way of transacting or interacting."" While potential threats to national security – such as the raising of funds for terrorism, the circumventing of sanctions and the ransoming of vital infrastructure – remain worth researching, Fanusie also emphasized the need to learn more about its benefits as well. He mentioned the growing prevalence of cryptocurrency exchanges conducting know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) due diligence as evidence of how products built with blockchain can help remove the need for middlemen while still adhereing to international protections. He also cited the increased exploration of blockchain by supply-chain infrastructure providers as a possible way to prevent trade-based money laundering, where the price of imported goods is increased or lowered to effectively send money or charge fees for illicit activities. ""It should be more difficult to traffic in weapons, or in drugs or doing money laundering, to funnel more money to a cause which could be used for a terrorist group,"" said Fanusie. In the fallout surrounding the WannaCry ransom attacks, a number of formal studies have been revealed. Just this week, an effort by the US Congress to better understand potential links between cryptocurrencies and terrorism, and a new partnership between the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and blockchain analysis firm Chainalysis, have both been announced. As for Fanusie, in addition to better understanding what it might mean if cryptocurrency usage were to spike in Iran, he says he wants to learn more about other usage patterns – for example, in China and in other nations and cities around the world – and how central banks might implement various blockchain solutions.

When a user broadcasts a bitcoin transaction (or one for any other digital currency), they attach a fee that acts as an incentive for miners to include that transaction in their next block. The higher the fee, the more likely a miner will want to include it, as they’ll collect any associated fees should their block be accepted by the wider network. According to an email sent to users by Xapo, they’ll now be responsible for this fee, though the startup clarified that any transfers between Xapo accounts won’t incur this charge. It cited growing network activity as the major factor behind the policy shift. The startup explained: While Xapo didn’t offer a firm date on when the policy change would come into effect, the email indicated that it would occur ""in the next couple of days"".

                            DC Blockchain Advocates Seek Distance From Bitcoin Amid Ransomware Wave                        ",Aaron Stanley,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-advocates-seek-distance-bitcoin-capitol-hill/,"Amid a flurry of negative publicity for bitcoin, technology advocates are trying to distance themselves from the digital currency as part of a bid to protect the perception of more enterprise-facing blockchain initiatives. The change of public positioning follows an uptick in ransomware attacks using bitcoin as the medium of payment, the most recent of which (after causing major disruption within the UK's National Health Service and elsewhere) has sparked a global conversation. At a briefing for congressional staff on Tuesday covering the potential uses of blockchain technology in the US healthcare system, the Chamber of Digital Commerce and a panel of other blockchain specialists acknowledged that the ransomware issue is again opening old wounds caused by the technology's association with illicit uses of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In response, panelists sought to draw clear lines between the two technologies. ""A lot of these initial attacks have been on healthcare systems and healthcare companies. This has come onto our radar because the ransomware is asking for the ransom in bitcoin,"" Perianne Boring, president of the Digital Chamber of Commerce, told an audience of roughly 70 healthcare and technology-focused staffers from congressional offices. Elsewhere, the panelists sought to categorize bitcoin as merely ""one application"" of blockchain technology. Srinivas Attili, senior vice president and partner at IBM Global Business Services, told attendees: Just how much regulatory attention is being aimed at bitcoin in the wake of the incidents is unclear, though a member of Congress introduced a bill Tuesday ordering the Department of Homeland Security to conduct a threat assessment regarding the use of virtual currencies by terrorists and criminals. It's happened before, so advocates worry bitcoin's bad press will rub off on blockchain. Attili drew the comparison to Amazon being just one among a countless number of businesses built on the HTTP protocol, and highlighted Hyperledger as a promising blockchain technology suite that he believes is isolated from any nefarious activity associated with cryptocurrencies. ""It's built for business. There's no concept of cryptocurrencies on Hyperledger,"" he said. Yet, Micah Winkelspecht, chief executive of Gem, a blockchain solutions company, did defend bitcoin, asserting that it's serving a legitimate use as a means of exchanging value. Winkelspecht said: ""Blaming bitcoin for ransomware would be like blaming the Federal Reserve for any illicit transaction that happens in cash,"" Boring added. Still, the damage dealt by the ransomware attacks, compounded by past black eyes like Mt Gox and Silk Road, may cut deeper than many in the cryptocurrency community may wish to recognize. Congressional staffers speaking privately after the event said the concept of blockchain must be, to all intents and purposes, disassociated from bitcoin to gain serious traction in the legislative arena. Boring tried to flip the narrative by saying that, instead of blaming bitcoin for the attacks, there should be greater focus on the potential of blockchain to protect against ransomware and other cyberattacks in the future. She said: Winkelspecht concurred, arguing that blockchain could provide a better, more secure way to store data as hackers become more sophisticated in the future. ""Before, we used to see attacks that were more DDoS – they were attacks on infrastructure trying to bring systems down,"" he said. ""Now we're starting to see more infiltration. They’re basically putting a ransom on data because that data is so valuable and they know that people will pay to unlock it."" Winkelspecht predicted that the next phase of cyberattacks will be ""data integrity"" attacks that involve breaking into a system and actually altering existing data in a way that ""tricks"" downstream systems. ""Those are the most dangerous and potentially the most costly types of attacks because you may not know it's happening for literally years,"" he explained. The immutability of blockchain technologies, though, could be the only true line of defense against such intrusions, he said adding: Washington, DC, image via Shutterstock

On 15th May, law firm Berns Weiss LLP filed a motion seeking to quash – legal-speak for rendering invalid – the IRS summons, which it first submitted in November. At the time, the US tax agency sought records on Coinbase's bitcoin users in a bid to catch potential tax cheats (the IRS deemed bitcoin and other digital currencies a taxable form of property in 2014). That effort sparked what has become a months-long legal battle that saw Berns Weiss intervene on behalf of its own managing partner, Jeffrey Berns, as well as Coinbase itself jumping into the fray. The IRS ultimately asked another federal judge in March to enforce the summons, which Coinbase indicated at the time it intended to fight. Court records show that, on 4th May, Judge Jacqueline Corley ordered the IRS and Coinbase to propose a briefing schedule during which Coinbase is expected to mount its defense. Berns Weiss submitted the new filing on behalf of two customers, referred in the documents as John Doe 1 and John Doe 2. The filing, according to the law firm, was spurred by the Corley's 4th May decision and ""to insure that Coinbase's customers are represented in the proceeding and that the Court has the opportunity to consider their perspective"". Notably, according to a separate filing, the two customers in question are seeking anonymity. The reason, they argue, is to prevent the IRS from ""attempting to moot Movants' motion by withdrawing its request that Coinbase provide Movants' records"". Attorney Lee Weiss said in a statement: A representative for Coinbase declined to comment when reached.

                            World's Biggest Tech Giants Could Boost Bitcoin in Regulatory Push                        ",Aaron Stanley,https://www.coindesk.com/worlds-biggest-tech-giants-boost-bitcoin-regulatory-push/,"While the cryptocurrency industry may see Apple and PayPal as competitors, those two tech companies are among a group pushing for regulatory reforms in the US that could provide a boost to the nascent industry. For those that missed the news, Apple and PayPal have joined forces with Google, Amazon and Intuit in Washington, DC, to push for reforms to spur innovation in the financial system. Notably, a core item on their agenda is a federal money transmission license that would supersede the existing state-by-state regime. Further, Financial Innovation Now (FIN), the lobby group representing the five companies, sent a letter to the Senate Banking Committee last month proposing a series of recommendations that, among other items, called for the establishment of a national money transmission requirement to be managed by the Treasury Department. ""Consumer protection is a critical part of payments regulation, but it makes no sense for different states to regulate digital money differently from one state to another,"" the letter explained. Brian Peters, executive director of FIN, stressed to CoinDesk the group is taking the money transmission issue seriously and is seeking a legislative solution. He said: While FIN admits it has no direct interest in advancing the digital currency ecosystem, it acknowledges the money transmitter issue is a common pain point. ""None of our priorities really actually delve into bitcoin or the other cryptocurrencies specifically. However, a lot of what we are pushing for does connect to the work many in that community are doing,"" said Peters. The group's rationale for pursuing such a reform, though, will surely resonate among those in the cryptocurrency space who have experienced similar headaches securing banking partnerships and other forms of access to traditional financial resources. ""The main reason we are pursuing it is because our companies have encountered a significant amount of friction and delay in the state-by-state money transmission licensing process,"" Peters said, adding: Such comments echo those that have long been put forth by innovators in the blockchain sector. Martine Niejadlik, former chief compliance officer of Coinbase, for example, has said that bitcoin is being held back from its potential because of basic regulatory and licensing questions. In addition to the costs of complying with scores of different sets of regulations, legal grey areas exist in states that have yet to decide whether bitcoin and other digital currencies should be considered money or be exempted from such regulations. A federal licensing option that would allow cryptocurrency companies to circumvent state regimes could have an exponential growth effect on the industry, said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center in Washington, DC. Van Valkenburgh continued: Van Valkenburgh emphasized that having a federal option could provide windfall benefits in the form of reduced compliance costs for companies like Coinbase and lower barriers to entry for startups. ""For startups, it’s the biggest thing,"" he said. ""Right now, you can't start your business unless you have millions to spend on compliance. And to get venture capital financing, you need to convince your venture capitalists that it's OK that the majority of their funding is going to lawyers."" While there have been multiple efforts in the past two decades to create a federal money transmission framework, these endeavors have fallen short due to a lack of money, leadership and political clout, as well as pushback from state regulators keen to protect their turf. FIN and its high-powered roster of big tech firms should encounter no such problems, explained Carol Van Cleef, a digital currency attorney with BakerHostetler in Washington. Van Cleef told CoinDesk: ""This kind of initiative requires money and lots of it, solid executive branch and congressional relationships and experience working legislative issues,"" she added. But with Congress and the political process as unpredictable as ever, there are no guarantees that any piece of legislation – regardless of who is backing it – can secure passage. Even if they falter in that regard, companies like Google and Apple have significantly ramped up their Washington presence in recent years and have an undeniable ability to influence conversations and drive agendas across multiple levels. These effects are already being felt, and all of this stands to potentially boost the cryptocurrency community, FIN's Peters said. ""There is more conversation in Washington around how financial regulation deals with modern technology than I think anyone ever would have anticipated even a year ago,"" he said. Yet, legal experts are quick to point out that the creation of a federal licensing regime will hardly mean the end of all regulatory headaches for cryptocurrency companies. ""A federal license or federal charter is not going to be a panacea because the price tag is going to be high,"" said Van Cleef, adding the actual burden of being regulated would likely not diminish either: The overall impact of a federal licensing scheme would also depend on the fate of important questions surrounding bitcoin that have yet to be settled – such as whether cryptocurrencies should be regulated in the same way as fiat money. ""If we in the marketplace think cryptocurrencies should be regulated the way dollars are regulated, then this development would help facilitate the use of cryptocurrencies as a unit of exchange,"" said Joel Telpner, an attorney with Sullivan & Worcester in New York, adding: Amazon app image via Shutterstock

Bitcoin Prices Retreat to $1,700                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/healthy-correction-bitcoin-prices-retreat-1700-range/," Bitcoin prices suffered what analysts largely called a correction today, falling nearly $100 to a low of roughly $1,650, almost 7% below the opening price. The price of bitcoin suffered this fallback after nearly doubling in less than two months, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Amid the strong interest from investors, bitcoin prices reached an all-time high of $1,848.75 on 11th May, but since then, they've fallen more than 10%. In response, several analysts weighed in on this decline, though most said it was to be expected given the recent run of gains. ""The price is pulling back after spectacular rises,"" said Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of exchange information service CryptoCompare. ""A correction is in play."" While bitcoin's price has retreated somewhat, more than one analyst described this as simply being a ""healthy"" correction. ""Prices can't keep going up and not correct,"" said Harry Yeh, managing partner of Binary Financial. Petar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub, offered similar sentiment, calling the activity a ""healthy correction"" in response to an upswell of recent hype. However, Zivkovski added that cryptocurrencies could face further declines. ""If it does, more downside is to be expected as traders rush to take profit on long positions they've held since the start of the bull run,"" he commented. Other analysts stated that the recent pullback in bitcoin prices was nothing out of the ordinary. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, described it as ""standard behavior"" after the huge gains seen lately. Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, provided similar input. ""It's like asking why it's raining when it's been dry for weeks. It's a small pullback, going up nonstop for weeks just wouldn't be natural,"" he said. Eliosoff projected that real alarm prices would be in the $1,200 to $1,000 range, concluding that unless we have a ""real drop"" like that, no explanation is required. Pencil image via Shutterstock

                            Buy a Green Card With Bitcoin? US Officials Weigh Impact on EB-5                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/us-officials-weigh-bitcoin-payments-eb-5-visa-program/,"US immigration services are actively weighing the question of whether bitcoin can be used to pay for obligations tied to a controversial visa program. The context: One avenue for acquiring a green card or permanent residency in the US is through the EB-5 Immigrant Investor Visa Program. This initiative was started in the 1990s as a way to attract overseas investor capital to projects in ostensibly needy areas. Yet the EB-5 program has come under fire in recent months amid accusations that it has become a vehicle for wealthy investors to effectively buy their way into the US and invest in projects – namely, luxury real estate – that are completely unrelated to the program's intended goal. The program has even been targeted by members of Congress for elimination given the criticism. Family members of Trump administrator advisor Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's son-in-law, sparked controversy earlier this month after appearing to encourage Chinese citizens to invest in their developments via the EB-5 program – and curry favor with Trump in the process. The bitcoin connection: Recent statements from the head of the Immigrant Investor Visa Program office, Lori MacKenzie, suggest that investors may, in fact, be able to pay their obligations under the EB-5 guidelines using bitcoin. MacKenzie, who spoke on 3rd March during an EB-5 event in Washington, DC, said that Citizenship and Immigration Services (CIS) is ""considering issues involving virtual currency such as bitcoin"" related to ""the use of bitcoin to transfer investment funds to the new commercial enterprise"". She went on to say: Bottom line: So, what does this mean? For starters, blockchain is a topic that is on the US government's radar, but whether it will result in a concrete policy shift or statement remains to be seen. A representative for CIS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Indeed, it's a subject – at least somewhat – that has come in the past, led by questions of whether income derived from bitcoin-related activities can be used to satisfy the EB-5 requirements. The consensus appears to be that the government shouldn't take issue with it, though as several experts remarked last year, the source of the funds would be a paramount issue. Then again, this could all be rendered moot should the EB-5 be abolished. At the same time, it's not clear whether the Trump administration will move to axe the program.

                            $1,700? Bitcoin's Price is Up Even as its Tech Progress Stalls                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/1700-even-bitcoin-tech-leaders-dont-know-price/,"""Honey badger don't give a shit."" Sometimes referred to as the 'honey badger of money' (after a famous viral video), bitcoin enthusiasts may find this comparison particularly apt of late. Since the beginning of the year, the network's value has nearly doubled – even while the community continues to be mired in debate. Market observers so far have offered a wide range of reasons for this uptick, though not all of them are good, with increasing prices causing concerns that the industry as a whole is entering a speculative bubble. Still, not everyone believes the boost is due to speculation. Redwood City Ventures founder Sean Walsh, for example, sent CoinDesk a bullet-pointed email summarizing the various global developments that could be contributing to the bitcoin price surge. He believes developments in South Korea, Japan, Russia and China have all contributed. The price surge, according to Walsh, is simply supply and demand. ""Bitcoin is dramatically more scarce than most people realize, especially in the context of its total addressable market of nearly 3 billion internet-connected adults,"" he continued. Walsh framed the situation simply as one where the cryptocurrency is seeing increased demand, which looks to only increase in the future: ""Once the global race to own bitcoin commences, the tiny supply of new bitcoins (just 54,000 new coins per month) will be completely overrun by demand,"" he said, adding: Still, to those following day-to-day technical developments, it might seem odd that the digital currency's price has seen such an upswing amid its scaling debate and a stalled upgrade known as SegWit. Kristov Atlas, a security engineer at wallet and data firm Blockchain, for example, wasn't able to find technical reasons for the uptick in demand. He told CoinDesk ""[It] must be something outside bitcoin that investors have changed their minds about,"" he suggested. While developers, admittedly, might not be experts on economic market conditions, those that have been in the industry for a while are perhaps more aware of how technical developments could contribute to bitcoin’s price. When asked, some argued the state of the technology could have something to do with the recent increase, though, perhaps in surprising way. For example, bitcoin’s block size debate took a weird turn a couple of months ago, when discussions about the possibility of forking bitcoin into two networks reappeared. This time around, some miners and developers suggested the idea of destroying the chain that didn't follow along with the majority of hashing power. This has yet to happen, though, and worries about such an event happening have since died down. Some wonder if this could have given the price boost. ""I think part of the rally is due to increased confidence that the risk of a contentious hard fork has all but evaporated,"" Reddit moderator BashCo said. Yet some expect to see a 'correction', where the price dips to a more reasonable place. The idea that raised tensions contribute to price swings fits with bitcoin developer and Nakamoto Institute director of research, Daniel Krawisz's view that the price has more to do with emotions. ""The price of bitcoin never makes sense and it doesn’t have very much to do with the tech,"" he said. ""It’s about emotion. It’s about greed."" Krawisz also sees the price more aligned with bitcoin's original value proposition of giving users more control, rather than more granular tech additions or debates. “It’s not the new features of bitcoin that matter. What matters are the old features. People keep moving into bitcoin because it's a better alternative than their own national currency,” he said, adding: Though, perhaps echoing other developer's sentiments about a reduction in fear, Krawisz went on to argue that the increase in demand probably has to do with bitcoin's apparent stability, since it’s been around for a long time compared with many cryptocurrencies. ""It's the same reason that people always get into bitcoin now as ever,"" he concluded. Balloon image via Shutterstock

                            Traditional IRAs Are Coming to the World of Bitcoin                        ",Drew Pierson,https://www.coindesk.com/traditional-iras-coming-world-bitcoin/,"New consumer interest in bitcoin is trickling up into traditional retirement savings products and tax-advantaged vehicles like Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs). But while a new phenomenon, cryptocurrency IRAs are no different than IRAs invested in more traditional options like stocks and bonds. Holders of IRAs can deduct contributions from their income tax every year until the commencement of disbursements, currently at 59.5 years old in the US. However, while there is no legal difference in an IRA account's status based on the investment, most popular IRA providers only allow pre-approved investments, not more unusual options like cryptocurrencies or private equity and property. According to data from Greene IRA, 38% of Americans use IRAs as a type of retirement savings. Currently, the firm BitcoinIRA is the only option for investors who wish to hold cryptocurrencies in their IRAs directly, using Kingdom Trust and Palo Alto-based BitGo for storage. BitcoinIRA took its first accounts in June 2016, and just recently began offering ethereum IRAs as well. (The firm even boasts former US Mint director Ed Moy as an advisor). Investors with 401ks through their employers can transfer those funds into such IRAs under certain circumstances. Damon Smedley, a BitcoinIRA investor, who lives in Portland, Oregon, opened an account with BitcoinIRA last year. A former manufacturing engineer for a major technology company, Smedley bought his first bitcoins in 2013 and has monitored the price since. That's a typical profile for early BitcoinIRA investors, said Chris Kline, chief operating officer of BitcoinIRA. But increasingly, Kline said, he has seen inquires from people who were less interested in the technology and were instead motivated by the uptrends in digital currency prices. Kline told CoinDesk: BitcoinIRA charges a one-time upfront fee of 15% on deposits of $15,000–$100,000; 13% on $100,000–$200,000 placements and 11% on those $200,000 and above. Kingdom Trust, a self-directed IRA provider and BitcoinIRA partner, also charges a custodian fee for holding bitcoins in a multi-signature wallet, enabling investors to verify funds in real-time. Kline said BitcoinIRA has seen a surge in interest as bitcoin prices have skyrocketed. To date, the price of bitcoin has almost doubled this year: from just under $1,000 at the end of 2016 to nearly $2,000 today. Considering this growth, Kline expects cryptocurrencies to one day be as commonly held in IRAs as stocks or bonds. Indeed, if there is one asset class well suited for retirement savings products like IRAs, it might be deflationary cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, which increase in value over time. (It's important to note, however, not all cryptocurrencies are deflationary by design). Notably, too, ethereum has climbed 900% since the beginning of the year, and the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies has spiked 80% over the last month alone. Another option for some IRA investors, who would like to benefit from the price increases without holding cryptocurrencies, is private placement with products offered by Grayscale Investments, a digital currency startup providing products for high net-worth investors and that works with IRA administrator The Entrust Group. For its products, investors must be accredited, which means a net worth of over $1m or income over $200,000 in each of the last two years. Both BitcoinIRA and The Entrust Group administer 'self-directed' IRAs, which means the account owner is responsible for their investments, including understanding the tax consequences. That's why the Government Accountability Office issued a report in January calling for more clarity on the tax consequences of less-common IRA investments so that investors are aware of the risk. For example, the IRS classifies virtual currencies as property today. Officials with the IRS have started compiling data on alternative investments in IRAs, including cryptocurrencies, and said in statements they plan to release findings sometime this year.

                            Bitcoin's Scaling Debate: The View From China's Miners                        ",Paul Elliot-Ennis & Rachel-Rose O'Leary,https://www.coindesk.com/miners-bitcoin-scaling-debate/,"Paul Elliot-Ennis is a lecturer and assistant professor in management information systems in the College of Business, University College Dublin, while Rachel-Rose O'Leary is an artist and writer researching cryptographic systems.  In this guest feature, Elliot-Ennis and O'Leary investigates the daily activities and political attitudes of China's well-established bitcoin mining sector, positioning his findings within the context of the network's scaling debate. At present, the bitcoin community is engaged in a voracious debate about how best to scale the network. But in such a context, it's sometimes all too easy to overlook the human figures involved in that debate. Positioned on one side are the Bitcoin Core developers, (a term many wish to avoid reifying) but who nonetheless are recognizable as a cadre of sorts. On the other side of the debate, underrepresented and frequently misunderstood, are the China-based mining pools and hardware providers. We reached out to three mining pools – AntPool, Bixin and BW – to get a varied perspective on how they feel about Western attitudes toward them, but also how the day-to-day operations of mining occur. Bitcoin culture can, at times, be argumentative, and this is at least partially attributable to the communication gap between China and the English speaking world. Virgilio Lizardo Jr, head of international for Bitbank Group (owners of BW pool), describes the language barrier between China and the English-speaking world as ""immense"", leading to a dialogue blighted by miscommunication. One significant effect of this divide, Virgilio emphasized, is that due to the lack of Chinese presence on English-speaking bitcoin forums, stereotypes of Chinese miners continue to proliferate. The sentiment is echoed by perhaps the most well-known Chinese miner of them all, Jihan Wu, co-founder of Bitmain, the operator of AntPool. He told CoinDesk: Lizardo, a transposed Westerner with a strong sense of Chinese culture, noted that one overlooked issue is that the miners have no obvious media outlet to get their position across, leading to distorted narratives and the compounding of mistrust. He further emphasized that there is a tendency to group the Chinese miners together as a single ""monolithic entity"". However, their visions for the future are predictably diverse. While Wu is an open supporter of Bitcoin Unlimited, positions toward the scaling debate vary enormously across the miners. Asked for his opinion, Tyler Xiong of Bixin, formerly HaoBTC, argued the importance of maintaining a single implementation of the protocol and a healthy community, stating: ""We don't want the breakup of bitcoin"". This is contrary to Wu, who commented: Wu also stressed that it is important to recognize that the mining operations in China and elsewhere are businesses, each with their own agenda and strategies. According to Wu, while there is a general consensus among miners that bigger blocks are needed, ""most miners prefer to stay away from the discussion"" and focus on the daily operation of their businesses. As is well-known, information about the actual, day-to-day mining operations in China are hard to come by. Occasionally, we will get photographs or videos of vast-industrial warehouses packed with whirring mining machines, but not much more. Often situated in the depths of the Chinese countryside they are, admittedly, aesthetically powerful: equal parts industrial traditionalism and science fiction. Most of the miners confirmed what many have long-known about why China cornered the mining market – cheap electricity. Wu, arguably the most successful mine operator in the history of bitcoin, said the most challenging part of planning a new mining farm is finding access to a low-cost and reliable electricity supply. Lizardo also reported that while constructing a mine is not difficult the ""logistics of transporting thousands of miners is challenging."" Tyler painted a picture of what occurs once construction is complete: At BW pool, most of the labour is drawn from local communities, trained by the company to become technicians and maintenance workers. Each miner we spoke to stressed that looking after the mines was a 24-hour job, requiring constant supervision by employees. Jihan highlighted this same phenomenon, stating: The take home across all the interviews was that mining was, at heart, a difficult, costly and time-consuming job. Further, that perhaps in the fog of endless debates we have lost sight of the important function Chinese miners have for bitcoin’s maintenance and security. Shanghai image via Shutterstock

                            Back to Reality? Bitcoin's Price Drops $100 Amid Meteoric Month                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/back-reality-bitcoins-price-drops-100-amid-meteoric-month/," The price of bitcoin saw something it hasn't seen much of lately today – a 24-hour decline to the tune of triple digits. According to figures from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, the day-over-day decline marks a rare occurrence over the last month. Over that span, bitcoin has been largely in the green, spurred by a diversity of factors on which analysts haven't found much to agree. The pause in price growth may be stunning, if only for the fact bitcoin has been consistently setting new all-time highs in recent trading sessions. Analyst and trader Jacob Eliosoff, for instance, downplayed bitcoin's off-day, positioning it in perspective of bitcoin's overall gains. The price of one bitcoin is up over $700 so far this year, and up nearly $1,300 since May of last year, BPI data shows. Still, Elisoff pointed to data that suggests bitcoin's historic corrections have been swift. He told CoinDesk: Others projected that the price may simply be consolidating after a period of intense growth, with over-the-counter trader Charlie Shrem reporting that he believes this to be the case. Shrem pointed to bitcoin's long-term value projections as evidence the market isn't ""satisfied"" even with the current price observed today.  And as the momentum subsides, some worry that bitcoin's past problems may now become more visible. For example, with litecoin having recently upgraded its code to scale its transaction capacity, it's possible bitcoin's scaling debate could soon again heat up. ""I think bitcoin will be worth $5,000 or $10,000 in a few years time, but it can't get there unless we get past this scaling debate, and short-term price rallies only serve to delay us dealing with this reality,"" said angel investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham. Lingham went on to note that price spikes of any severity are also more likely to make bitcoin's limited throughput apparent. ""The rewards per block keep going up,"" he remarked. Data from Bitnodes now suggests it costs about 240 satoshis to clear 1 byte of transactions on the network, meaning average transaction fees are now above $1. Charles Hayer, CEO of digital currency data website CryptoCompare, agreed with Lingham. ""In terms of capacity bitcoin is straining at the seams, whilst litecoin is streets ahead in terms of forward thinking and governance,"" he said. While still conjecture, the comments point to potentially troubled waters ahead – or big gains if an upgrade can finally be made. Charles Bovaird contributed reporting.

                            Palestinian Government Said to Be Considering a Bitcoin-Like Currency                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/palestinian-government-bitcoin-currency/,"Palestine's monetary authority is reportedly looking to create its own digital currency. Reuters reported today that, according to Azzam Shawwa, head of the Palestinian Monetary Authority, the State of Palestine is weighing a “bitcoin-style solution” to its lack of a central currency. As Reuters points out, a mix of US dollars, euros and other regional currencies are used by Palestinians instead. It's the absence of a Palestinian currency and the hurdles that stand in the way of launching one that appears to have drawn the Monetary Authority's attention toward a wholly digital solution. For example, according to Shawwa, the authority – which acts as the region's de facto central bank – doesn't have the ability to issue its own currency, due to the agreement that led to its establishment. ""It will be called the Palestinian pound,"" Shawwa told the publication. He later suggested that it might be backed by some kind of commodity, mentioning ""reserves, gold, oil"" as possible assets to underlie the currency. If launched, it could provide much-needed digital payment rails for those living in the Palestinian territories. And as outlets reported last September, services such as PayPal have refused to service the Palestinian market. While it's not clear at this time when the digital currency would be launched, Reuters indicated that the Palestinian Monetary Authority wants to see a debut in the next five years.

The past few days have seen bitcoin shoot past $1,700 and then $1,800. Only a month ago, prices hovered around $1,200, according to data from the BPI. At press time, the average price of bitcoin is roughly $1,754, representing a dip of about 2.9% from the opening but also a partial recovery from the day's low. Other cryptocurrency markets have seen dips in the past day, including litecoin, which is down about 5% in the past 24-hours, according to data from CoinMarketCap.

                            Pieter Wuille's Latest Project: Making Bitcoin Harder to Lose                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/pieter-wuilles-latest-project-making-bitcoin-harder-lose/,"One of bitcoin's most prolific developers is attempting to help with one of the payment network's longest-running issues. Today, bitcoin is known for the new digital control of money it provides to users, not for it's usability and convenience. And if you haven't experienced it yourself, you've probably at least heard stories about users losing their private keys, accidentally sending bitcoin to the wrong address due to a typo, or some other gaffe. To date, ideas to get around the direct use of public and private keys – long strings of characters that control bitcoin accounts – look like they're some years away. One fuzzy idea, for example, is to somehow bury them completely so that users don't even realize they're using bitcoin. For now, though, cryptocurrencies are stuck with confusing addresses. This is where Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille's latest project Bech32 (which he is co-developing with Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell) aims to at least steer addresses in a more user-friendly direction, if in a less revolutionary way. The end game is a new kind of bitcoin address with capabilities baked in to help users detect when they type the wrong address. The opportunity to make the improvement arose when bitcoin developers realized that they would need to invent an entirely new addressing scheme anyway with the possible future integration of SegWit – a controversial change proposed for bitcoin's code. The tech upgrade, if ever implemented, works best with a new bitcoin address format. Wuille told CoinDesk: He added that SegWit can also be used with existing addresses, but with ""slightly lower efficiency and security."" It's important to note, though, that the new format won't replace the old one. Rather, it's an alternative that would be used for SegWit transactions, should they be deployed on bitcoin. ""The old-style addresses will remain in use for all purposes they were used for before. Only native SegWit outputs will use Bech32 addresses,"" Wuille explained. To recap, a bitcoin address is a version of a user's public key to which users can send value. Its unique identifying information is similar to a credit card number, and you can post this string on a public page or send it to a person in order to receive funds. Right now, bitcoin addresses are encoded in the format Base58, meaning the unique ID is displayed as a string of letters and numbers. This format already builds in a form of user protection because it cuts out six characters that look similar to each other. The subtle difference between '0' and 'O' might unintentionally trick users copying their bitcoin address from a computer screen, for instance. Rather than risk a mixup, both letters are removed completely. Base32, a part of Bech32, takes the 'human-readable' element even further. Letters in the new addressing format are either all lower case or all upper case (not a combination). Here's an example of the old format:   And, here's an example of an address in the new format:   Next, the new format builds in a form of error detection. Wuille has put together a demo that actually flags key entry mistakes. If you mistype the address – say you write an incorrect letter – it knows, sometimes even highlighting the erroneous letter in red. The bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) describing the new scheme also highlights other technical details that are more likely to interest wallet developers aiming to implement the format. For example, Bech32 requires less space for QR codes, a barcode that you can scan with a smartphone (or other device) to retrieve a bitcoin address. Further, decoding the new format is faster than with Base58. Today, this scheme is tailored toward bitcoin addresses, those which users can make public to receive bitcoin. Yet, Wuille said at a recent meetup that the same technique could also one day be used for private keys. A number of developers, such as the teams behind some capacity boosting Lightning Network implementations and bitcoin wallet Electrum, are looking into using the new format. Litecoin developers are, too, as the lesser-known cryptocurrency adopted the SegWit update on Wednesday. On the other hand, while this new format was created for bitcoin, Wuille emphasized it isn't just for the cryptocurrency world, and could have applications where similar formats are used. Base64, for example, a widely used format that doesn't necessarily have human-readability in mind, is used for encoding all kinds of data. If the address scheme is ever implemented, Wuille added, he expects that it will take time for users to pick up and use the new technology, since both senders and receivers need to support it to make a successful transaction. This has been the case for pay-to-script hash (P2SH) addresses, which are addresses for more advanced (and less used) bitcoin transactions types, such as those that require two out of three participants to sign off on sending money. Wuille concluded: Correction: An earlier version misstated that SegWit ""requires"" a new format. This has been corrected. Pieter Wuille image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk

                            The PayPal Moment: When Bitcoin Met Mainstream Payments                        ",Steve Beauregard,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-milestones-paypal-moment-bitcoin-mainstream-payments/,"Steve Beauregard is serial entrepreneur, co-founder of cryptocurrency payment processing startup GoCoin and chief revenue officer at Bloq.  In this entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Beauregard looks back on the day PayPal began accepting bitcoin – giving its stamp of approval to a technology many believed had the potential to disrupt it.   It's a Monday in Bitropolis, but not just any Monday. For nearly three months, the GoCoin team had kept painfully silent on the biggest bitcoin news story in the industry to date. In 12 short hours, the press embargo would lift, the news would jolt the financial world and GoCoin would be cemented in history alongside BitPay and Coinbase as the startups that ushered one of the world's largest payment companies into cryptocurrencies. Yet, on the eve of that very announcement, our inclusion was far from certain. *** When I founded GoCoin along with Brock Pierce in mid-2013, we discussed that we may be too late. BitPay had been offering payment services to online merchants for well over a year, touting they had signed up 10,000 merchants. Coinbase announced they had signed up the first major retailer, Overstock, to accept bitcoin. GoCoin had raised a modest seed round and was ""heads down"" in development while BitPay and Coinbase continued to one up each other with increasingly impressive announcements – Gyft, CheapAir, Virgin Galactic and Dell. It felt like every day GoCoin wasn't live would mark another major merchant lost to BitPay or Coinbase. In response, I was putting intense pressure on the development team to compress the Go Live schedule. My system architect, Margot Ritcher, and lead developer, my nephew Kevin Beauregard, agreed we could cut a month out of the schedule if we compromised on the multi-blockchain, multi-coin design. The downside of taking the shortcut, would be a major software rewrite. As you will see later in the story, taking the extra time to keep the multi-blockchain design proved to be the right decision. *** Finally, in December 2013, GoCoin announced that it was taking donations for the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Monica. We were finally in the race, and I ramped up my Series A fundraising efforts. With the price of bitcoin having gone from the $100 to over $1,000 in the previous months, booking VC meetings on Sand Hill Road was never easier. In early 2014, GoCoin firmly planted a flag on the cryptocurrency moon by announcing support for litecoin and dogecoin payments. The bitcoin purists lost their minds: ""You are ruining bitcoin, altcoins are a joke!"" On Reddit, people decreed: ""You are scammers taking these scam coins!"" Those were the nicest comments I can publish here. *** While the GoCoin team learned to operate the business, I already had $2.5m committed of our $5m Series A funding with about $1m already in the bank. But our fundraising efforts came to a screeching halt when news broke that Mt Gox, the largest bitcoin exchange, had been the victim of a major heist where about 25% of all bitcoin in circulation had been stolen. The entire industry was in a state of shock and chaos, funding options instantly dried up and even those that had committed to our round never funded. My board decided, rather than fight the market, to just close our Series A, which together with the seed capital came to a skinny $1.5m. Despite the modest raise, GoCoin was still the best funded LA bitcoin startup at the time. We had negotiated a very favorable top floor lease overlooking Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade. GoCoin also sublet space to fellow blockchain startups, developers, lawyers, accountants and provided space for meetups and the first bitcoin ATM in LA. We named the space 'Bitropolis'. *** In the months that followed, GoCoin gained steady traction with our strategy of supplementing bitcoin payments with other alternative digital currencies. In many cases, we convinced early adopters like CheapAir, KnCMiner and eGifter to add GoCoin so as to not ""limit their customer to only bitcoin"". We also continued to shake things up by announcing Larry Flint's Hustler brand as a high-profile merchant. By 22nd September, 2014, the GoCoin directors assembled in offices of embedded Bitropolis attorney Adam Ettinger. Perhaps more importantly than the impact the big announcement would have on financial institutions, we were  finally getting validation that our naysayers were wrong. Bitcoin is not ""only used by drug dealers"", ""a Ponzi scheme"" or a ""joke""! Why the emergency meeting? On the eve of the announcement, an email with the heart-stopping subject line ""GoCoin AML Compliance"" hit my inbox. At the 11th hour, they are requesting a ""full assessment"" from our attorney and we had to decide how to respond. *** The questions were flying around the room, did one of our competitor's investors pull some strings to knock us out? By ""full assessment"", did they want a legal opinion? Were they looking for an excuse to dismiss us? Was this simply a routine checklist and a box remained unchecked? In the previous months, GoCoin had stealthily worked with engineers, business development, marketing, PR and, of course, the legal department of PayPal. The technical hoops to integrate GoCoin's payment platform into PayPal's PaymentHub were trivial compared to the due diligence process. We had a full legal opinion from a top Isle of Man law firm. They reviewed our compliance program extensively, requesting we tighten up aspects of our on-boarding procedures and add payment monitoring features. Most importantly, we had to satisfy their legal team that our compliance program was not only solid, but that we were continuing to improve it. Even with that, BitPay had raised $30m from Index Ventures and Coinbase $25m from A16z. It would not have been surprising for PayPal to toss out our small scrappy undercapitalized startup. At 9pm, our attorney sent a carefully worded ""assessment"", but certainly well short of a legal opinion. The response came back from PayPal: ""Thanks. That's all we needed."" On the morning of 23rd September, PayPal announced it would begin accepting bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin payments via GoCoin, and bitcoin payments via Coinbase and BitPay. Within minutes, the price of all three coins spiked. Reddit was buzzing, and thanks to the superb strategy of my PR goddess Amanda Coolong, my phone was ringing off the hook with reporters asking about the GoCoin deal with PayPal. History was made. *** Yet, soon after signing this milestone agreement, parent company eBay announced they were spinning off PayPal. As a result, PayPal's blockchain ambitions were pushed to the back-burner. As I reflect on it, in terms of mainstream merchant adoption for online payments, I would have to say late 2014 to early 2015 was the first big peak. At the time, GoCoin was signing up about 750 merchants per month, including top brands like MovieTickets.com, Lionsgate Films and Re/MAX. Even though many of the merchants didn't get the volume of transactions they had hoped for, their brands were now regarded as innovators. Bitcoin exchanges and merchant processors were the bitcoin 1.0 trailblazers that brought bitcoin out of the shadows of the dark web and started to lift the reputational stain left by Silk Road. After four years at the helm, I have stepped down as CEO of GoCoin, yet I remain on the board of the parent company. GoCoin has been profitable for nearly two years now, and I still believe there is a bright future for the company and blockchain merchant payments. That said, the industry needs to mature in order to see the kind of growth we envisioned back in 2014, and I feel I can affect more change outside of GoCoin than I can from within. Recently, I join the Bloq team founded by Matt Roszak and former Bitcoin core developer Jeff Garzik. I've always had tremendous respect for both, and I’m thrilled they have welcomed me in as a partner. My thesis for merchant payments is that the largest and most successful companies will likely implement their own payment systems.  PayPal image via Shutterstock

                            Tokenized Bitcoin Mines? New Startup Giga Watt Unveils ICO Plan                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/tokenized-bitcoin-mines-new-startup-giga-watt-unveils-ico-plan/,"It's been a long road for Dave Carlson. One of the world's more recognizable bitcoin miners, Carlson gained global attention for his multimillion-dollar mining venture MegaBigPower during the bitcoin boom of 2014 only to almost lose the business when would-be franchise partners failed to come through on hardware purchases. Despite professing to own tens of thousands of bitcoins and litecoins at various times, he now looks back at what he could have made if only he waited to sell. ""I worked for free for a year,"" Carlson said. ""Sometimes, that's what you have to do to survive. People appealed to me to trust them and you get taken advantage of."" But Carlson now sees new opportunity in the booming market for initial coin offerings (ICOs), the process by which technologists are creating cryptographically unique data sets, linking them to a blockchain and selling them to investors as a fundraising tool. In this seemingly ever-expanding market, Carlson is launching a new venture. Called Giga Watt, the startup aims to fulfill Carlson's long-time goal of democratizing access to bitcoin mining, this time by enabling investors to buy a stake in his company's services. At a high level, the idea is that Giga Watt is tokenizing the power infrastructure that supports the facilities that host and operate equipment. ""We're building and reselling crypto-mines. If you want a big mine, you buy a lot of tokens. If don't want to buy miners, then you let us put somebody else's miners in your spot and get paid. You don't have to concern yourself with how blockchains work,"" Carlson explained. He told CoinDesk: In this way, the idea is the latest and perhaps one of the more ambitious attempts to capitalize on the access to capital provided by the ICO mechanism. Though, it's important to note similar ventures so far have produced varying results for their initiators. For example, when bitcoin pioneer Charlie Shrem sought to tokenize shares in companies this year, the ICO was eventually scrapped after months of promotion. Others have fared better with the model, with startup Gnosis raising over $12m in just under 15 minutes by selling 5% of the tokens that will power its in-development prediction market. According to Carlson, Giga Watt has raised over $1m from undisclosed investors to build out the facilities that would be used as part of the initiative. Scheduled to open to the public on 2nd June, Carlson said that Giga Watt is already exploring a pre-sale (and a pre-pre-sale) of its token while building up his team to offer support. For Carlson, the idea is aimed at solving a long-standing conceptual issue for the bitcoin network – namely, that the economics that make bitcoins valuable have created economies of scale that made it impossible for smaller miners to compete for the rewards produced by the protocol. At the heart of the issue is that, many enthusiasts believe decentralized access to the network is the key differentiator of bitcoin when compared to the centralized online money services it was designed to compete against. In this way, Carlson sees Giga Watt as a managed services provider selling its professional abilities and the cheap power resources that make Washington state one of the more profitable areas of the world to operate equipment. Those who participate in the sale, Carlson said, will have funds placed in escrow until Giga Watt delivers on supplying the power infrastructure. Giga Watt will, in turn, invest the funds it makes into its own mining capabilities. ""We would have facilities that are occupied for token holders, then we have facilities that are wholly owned by Giga Watt,"" Carlson explained. For now, even Carlson is a bit unclear on how the economics of the model will play out. While the idea is to sell the tokens for $1 at launch, he conceded that it's possible the market could drive up the price of the asset in such a way that the value could conflict with their utility. Already platforms like ethereum, designed itself to enable the launch of ICOs and other tokenized assets, are facing challenges related to this difficult dynamic. Still, Carlson said that this is simply a factor that the market will need to take into account as it participates in the offer. ""People need to understand that our token is something that works best when it's combined with mining or its buying into a co-location facility or a landlord of power,"" he said. He further said that investors shouldn't conceive of the token as an asset with boundless utility, or that the token would necessarily provide outsized returns directly. ""I don't want people to buy the token thinking it's going to do the moon,"" he said. ""People are going to be willing to pay more than what we're selling for, but it's not a share ownership of a company."" Another factor to keep in mind is that token owners will be served with mining power in a first-come, first-serve manner, meaning those who buy earlier will have access to the token's real-world utility, and the potential earnings from the mining operations. Carlson also stressed the legal work underpinning the offering, which is being issued by Giga Watt's Singaporean entity. (It worked with US law firm Perkins Coie on the structure to ensure that the token wouldn't be deemed a security.) Carlson said Giga Watt plans to sell 30 million tokens as part of the sale, and he remains confident that potential buyers will capitalize on the opportunity. ""We can offer this to anyone. You can buy one token if that's meaningful to you. A household could buy a few hundred dollars of tokens and buy more tokens later,"" he said. For now, Carlson is launching a website to support Giga Watt, which lists its available plans and the costs associated with the purchase. (In a bid for transparency, the firm lets buyers schedule an open house to see the facilities). On display also are its planned 'Giga Pod' units: mining warehouses that Carlson said have been optimized for efficiency with the years of expertise gleaned in the operation of MegaBigPower, his former operation. Until the launch, though, he acknowledged that the market needs to now digest the deal and understand how it works. But he believes, if successful, it could be beneficial for the bitcoin network and investors at large. Carlson concluded: Bitcoin mining image via Giga Watt

                            Bitcoin Miner Canaan Raises $43 Million for Blockchain, AI Push                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-miner-canaan-raises-43-million-blockchain-ai-push/,"China-based Canaan Creative, maker of the Avalon bitcoin mining chip series, has raised 300m yuan (roughly $43m) as part of a bid to diversify its business. Valuing the firm at ¥3bn (approximately $430m), the Series A round saw the participation of Jin Jiang International Group, Baopu Asset Management and Tunlan Investment. The investment is the largest-ever announced by a bitcoin mining business, though one that's in line with moves from Canaan's competitors. One of the largest makers of ASIC chips specialized for mining, the firm's diversification follows competitor Bitfury's transition into software services and pursuits centered on enterprise blockchain offerings. For Canaan, however, the funding will serve as a means to facilitate the exploration of computing chips for use in artificial intelligence (AI) applications, and potentially, into hardware solutions for alternative cryptocurrencies that require different chips to optimize the mining process. Spokesperson Steven Mosher told CoinDesk: According to Mosher, the company believes AI will provide the most fertile ground for the Canaan's expansion, and he projected that the returns could be ""as good as"" the company's earnings from mining chip sales. Further, he suggested that given the interest in intersections between the two industries there could be ""synergy down the road"". Mosher also hinted at other products aimed at alternative cryptocurrencies. ""We have new products in the pipeline both on the proof-of-work side of things, and also around the whole blockchain ecosystem,"" he said. Such diversification is not uncommon these days, as many mining pools, for example, offer software that enables mining computers to coordinate in the race to secure various blockchains and compete for their rewards. However, it's notable that the shift comes during a time when the alternative cryptocurrency markets have emerged as one of the more active areas of ecosystem growth. So far in 2017, the combined value of all public cryptocurrencies, bitcoin included, has swelled 180%, rising to $51bn from roughly $18bn at the start of the year, according to data provider Coinmarketcap. If that sounds high, however, the market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies excluding bitcoin has seen even more robust growth. The value of these assets, including popular alternatives like litecoin and ether has risen to $22bn, up from just over $2bn at the end of 2016. Mosher, however, stopped short of characterizing the strategy as one that means the company is diversifying away from bitcoin. In part, Mosher said this is because there is a natural upward bound on how much mining firms can make in the bitcoin ecosystem alone. As an example, he cited the fact that mining chip producers have to strike a tricky balance between hardware sales and deploying those chips themselves in data centers for the purposes of securing the bitcoin blockchain. ""If you create more hashing power, you're competing against the other side of your business,"" he explained. ""You're making money from your customers, but you're hurting [your] mining operation [by raising bitcoin's difficulty calculations]."" Canaan, for its part, only makes chips and doesn't use them in mining data centers, as do competitors Bitfury and Bitmain. Mosher said he expects more bitcoin miners to follow this path due to the fact that the business is lucrative enough to fund other efforts. (A study by the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, for instance, projected that more than $2bn has been earned from mining since the network began running in 2008). ""We're all making money on the main chain and the question is, what are we doing with that money?"" Mosher said. ""Blockchain has been so good, such a great opportunity, and it throws off a good amount of cash, it's about staying strong and robust."" The funding also follows a time of transition for the company, which was nearly acquired by electrical equipment maker Shandong Luyitong Intelligent Electric in 2016 in what would have been the industry's largest-ever acquisition if completed. At the time, Shandong Luyitong was said to have offered ¥3.06bn to acquire 100% ownership of the firm in a move that would have made the combined entity a publicly traded company. The sale was ultimately blocked in September of that year by the Shenzhen Stock Exchange due to ""uncertainties"", though not ones that reportedly stemmed from its bitcoin activities. In statements, Mosher still described the Series A as a ""pre-IPO"" round, though he stopped short of providing any further details. If pursued, Canaan would be one of the first bitcoin startups to IPO in the traditional market, a strategy that was also put forward by Bitfury CEO Valery Vavilov in 2014. Image courtesy of Canaan

The cut, announced today by the Australian Department of the Treasury, brings an end to a years-long controversy over the way consumers faced the prospect of paying double GST when first buying, then spending digital currencies. The government began looking into the matter in mid-2015, and the removal of the tax comes just days after officials reaffirmed their pledge to resolve the issue. If the new budget is approved, the policy will go into effect on 1st July, according to the Treasury Department. The Australian government noted that the new budget ""will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia"". Officials unveiled their plan to eliminate the GST charge on digital currencies last year, as part of a wide-ranging statement on fintech. The budget also includes support for a previously announced fintech accelerator program. The goal, according to the government, is to provide a two-year window for new technology firms to test financial products in a limited setting – a strategy that a number of governments and central banks worldwide have pursued in recent months. “Robust consumer protections and disclosure requirements will be in place to protect customers including responsible lending obligations, best interest duty, and the need for adequate compensation and dispute resolution arrangements,” the Treasury Department said of the program. While not part of today's release, Australia is also weighing potential regulatory changes to account for blockchain applications. Scissors image via Shutterstock

At $1,700, bitcoin prices are up 70% already on the year and around $200 on the week, having climbed from $997 in January to set a string of new highs. Minutes before press time, bitcoin's new all-time high on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index was $1,710.96. As reported by CoinDesk, the uptick comes at a time when broader interest in the crypto markets appears to be increasing and winning new investors. While bitcoin is up 70%, alternative cryptocurrencies are up 600% since March. The recent price rise, however, puts bitcoin at a level that analysts have suggested could prove a key resistance. CoinDesk contributor Willy Woo, for instance, projected late last week that bitcoin was likely to hit so-called 'channel resistance' at $1,717. Should it break this level, Woo projected a bubble could form in the market, whereby the price had increased meaningfully beyond annual average user growth. The development could place the wider cryptocurrency markets on uncertain ground, as analysts are already expressing concerns crypto assets have entered bubble territory. Still, others pushed back that this applies to bitcoin, an asset seen as having more long-term utility and value.

                            Bitcoin Hedge Fund: Scaling Resolution Could Double Price                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hedge-fund-scaling-resolution-double-price/,"Despite bitcoin's recent all-time highs, the digital asset could see bigger price gains if its scaling debate ultimately resolves, at least according to one major hedge fund centered on the technology. In an email to investors this week, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), a Jersey-based investment vehicle that buys and sells bitcoin on behalf of investors, touched on ongoing developments in the digital currency markets, putting a special emphasis on developments in litecoin and how they relate to the larger bitcoin market. In the note, the firm pointed to the acceptance of Segregated Witness – a technical upgrade originally developed for bitcoin – by the litecoin community as one major factor behind that market's upward movement. The integration of SegWit on litecoin is a notable given the reticence by bitcoin miners to accept the upgrade on technical and political grounds. Yet, should this kind of implementation be repeated for bitcoin, GABI argued, markets could have a similar reaction. The firm wrote: The hedge fund also highlighted the broad increases observed across most cryptocurrency markets of late, which have increasingly diversified away from bitcoin. As reported last week, markets outside of bitcoin have seen major trade activity in recent days, pushing the combined market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies above $50bn for the first time ever. Of that, bitcoin accounts for roughly $27bn, according to available data. ""This is a stunning progression and speaks to the thesis we've held for some time that the cryptocurrency landscape would become increasingly diverse in response to user demand,"" GABI said.

                            Vermont Law Adds Bitcoin as 'Permissible Investment' for MSBs                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/vermont-law-bitcoin-msbs-investment/,"Vermont has passed a new bill that tweaks state law to account for digital currencies. The bill, signed into law on 4th May according to public documents, updates the state’s money transmission rules with a definition for ""virtual currency"". It was first introduced in February with six sponsors. Money transmitters are also now allowed to hold digital currencies as a kind of ""permissible investment"", but with the caveat that this can be done ""only to the extent of outstanding transmission obligations received by the licensee in identical denomination of virtual currency"". That the state would look to shore up its rules around digital currencies and money transmitters is perhaps unsurprising, given past developments. A lack of concrete rules previously led to uncertainty among those who operated in that gray area, including bitcoin ATM owners. In early 2015, representatives from the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation said that the state didn’t need to pursue an approach like New York’s BitLicense framework, which some have criticized as too onerous. The bill is Vermont’s second that focused in part on the tech. Last year, the state passed a measure that made blockchain records admissible in court. With the measure’s signing, Vermont becomes the latest state to update its existing rules to account for digital currency business activity. States such as New York, North Carolina, Washington and Hawaii, among others, have pursued legislative approaches to overseeing the space. Other states, including New Hampshire, have by comparison looked to deregulate aspects of the industry, particularly independent brokers. Vermont State House image via Shutterstock

                            Litecoin is Giving New Life to Bitcoin's Most Experimental Tech                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/litecoin-giving-new-life-bitcoins-experimental-tech/,"Usually dismissed as less innovative than the more widely used bitcoin blockchain, the activation of a code upgrade called Segregated Witness (SegWit) is inspiring developers to give the smaller litecoin network a second look. The fourth-largest public blockchain by total investment, litecoin is expected to formally add SegWit this week – a move that could pave the way for projects that are all but impossible to implement on bitcoin today. And, with the chances that SegWit will activate on bitcoin appearing less likely, the decision has put a new spotlight on litecoin, launched in 2011 as one of the first 'altcoins' seeking to optimize the bitcoin code base. Now, projects that were seeking to build on top of SegWit on bitcoin are beginning to talk openly about using litecoin as a testbed that would hopefully prove their ideas on a live, public blockchain. So far, the Lightning Network is the most concrete example of how some teams are adapting to the new possibility. Last week, one Lightning project released a version of its software designed to be compatible with litecoin. But other projects that are dependent on SegWit look to be eyeing the bitcoin alternative as well. Nicolas Dorier, bitcoin developer and CTO for distributed ledger startup Metaco, summed up the current mood by explaining that developers are simply becoming eager to continue their work in any way possible. Dorier told CoinDesk: Still, the transition won't be as easy as it might sound, as there is work needed to ensure both the litecoin code base and projects that seek to use it can make the switch. For example, Johnson Lau, one of the lead developers behind MAST (which seeks to enable more complex smart contracts on bitcoin), now plans to implement the project on top of litecoin. So far, this has seen Lau taking a more active day-to-day role with litecoin's code, writing up a guide to help miners to prepare for SegWit activation. Dorier, who also leads development of NBitcoin, a .NET library for programmers, mentioned that he has spent some time adding support for SegWit into the software. After growing ""frustrated"" with the fact that SegWit wasn't activating on bitcoin, he made the library compatible with litecoin – a process that took him only a few hours, he said. Dorier's other well-known project is NTumbleBit, an implementation of the theoretical decentralized coin mixer TumbleBit that works as a top-layer network similar to Lightning. (Dorier hopes eventually to add functionality that will allow users to exchange bitcoin for litecoin trustlessly and with more privacy via the service.) ""That’s my goal,"" he said. The buzz over SegWit is also helping jumpstart previously announced litecoin R&D efforts. For instance, another much-talked-about project that could see use on litecoin is 'confidential transactions', designed to shield sensitive data on public blockchains. Litecoin developers have been working on implementing the idea since at least September, when Litecoin Core developer Xinxi Wang issued a development update in which he argued that SegWit would make it easier to deploy the privacy-focused technology. Yet, when contacted by CoinDesk, Litecoin Foundation director Franklyn Richards said that the team isn't ready to talk about the project yet. One potential problem is that confidential transactions take up about almost 20 times more space on the blockchain than normal transactions. Considering that blockchain networks have limited capacity today (prompting much caustic debate in the bitcoin space), this factor could perhaps represent a problem for litecoin further down the road. Further, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell, who's been working on confidential transactions, argued in a recent talk that it would be ""premature"" to add the technology to litecoin today. Other developers, however, spoke to their desire to use litecoin, if only for short-term ideation. Sergio Demián Lerner, a developer at bitcoin smart contract startup RSK, said the team is unlikely to change its plans depending on ""which blockchain activates SegWit first"". He emphasized: However, since the firm plans to open source the tech, it's possible that others will take up the reigns and build their own version on top of litecoin. ""We will help any serious group that works to foster RSK technology,"" he added. Still, it's worth noting that there's an element of politicization in the works. Despite the fact that litecoin has passed SegWit, as RSK's comments show, there's still a preference among developers toward the bitcoin network, which is seen as a more serious and more valuable long-term project. Further, the kinds of technical projects that are considering migrating efforts to litecoin are generally experimental and very early stage. The combination of both factors has raised some concerns in the community. While litecoin may enable a wave of youthful projects to test their ideas, some have expressed fears that in doing so they will 'pump' the value of litecoin's token by way of making grand technical promises that win attention from investors. Already, litecoin's price has swelled to three-year highs on the SegWit news. And Dorier, for one, has been mulling over longer-term problems, telling CoinDesk: He pointed to the current favored way of making upgrades to bitcoin consensus rules, echoing the opinion that it unintentionally gives miners too much power to veto development upgrades. The concern is, if this issue is never rectified on bitcoin, future litecoin upgrades along the lines of SegWit might have trouble getting support as its network and value grows. With so much still uncertain, the takeaway might be that it’s still too early to know how (or whether) litecoin will play a role in bringing these projects to life as a get-around to bitcoin's long-standing scaling quagmire. Still, Blockstream's Maxwell expressed general optimism about litecoin's upcoming SegWit activation, saying at a recent meetup: Colored eggs image via Shutterstock

                            The Second Wave of Bitcoin Price Growth May Just Be Beginning                        ",Willy Woo,https://www.coindesk.com/second-wave-bitcoin-price-growth-may-just-beginning/,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, investor, trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast. In this guest feature, Woo breaks down recent developments in the bitcoin markets, arguing that with a trading band broken, the cryptocurrency could be entering a new phase of maturity.  Something interesting has been happening the last couple of weeks. I'm pretty well connected to a lot of veterans in crypto, and independently, we've all been fielding inquiries from smart money investors, the non-technical types who are now ready for a hedge instrument against global uncertainty. Our basic conclusion is that what we're seeing right now is a whole lot of new money coming into the cryptocurrency markets. Some have been perplexed with this unprecedented rise, and it's easy to see why. The total market cap of the space is now $46.5bn, a figure that's up roughly 50% over the last few weeks.  That might seem simplistic, but it's also coinciding with a lot of uncertainty in Europe. On Sunday, 7th May, we will see the outcome of elections in France. Of the two candidates, Emmanuel Macron and Marine Le Pen, Len Pen is for France leaving the European Union. Should this happen, it could signal the start of an EU breakup. Now, Le Pen is considered a long shot, similar to President Donald Trump in the US elections last year, but we know what happened there. Savvy investors have been looking for hedges, and now new money is moving into cryptocurrency. But, new money is also flowing from bitcoin into alternative cryptocurrencies. So-called ""altcoins"" are getting the benefits of bitcoin's two-year stalemate on scaling, so the amount of money falling out significant. Now, it's important to understand that altcoins markets, with the exception of ethereum's ether token, are thinly traded. This means that for every $1 going into altcoins, their markets rise disproportionally compared to bitcoin's deeply traded market. This adds an amplifier to the altcoin market cap rise. Really, the big clue to this situation is bitcoin and ethereum are both rising at the same time when we typically see a see-saw action. Beyond a shadow of a doubt, this is evidence that new money is coming into the system. Another less-discussed development is that bitcoin broke out of its long-time trading channel yesterday. This is significant, as the channel has held for a multi-year timeframe.  It's now carving out new all-time highs without a channel resistance to hold it down. In this situation, all bets are off. Since there are no historical resistance points, we default to Fibonacci levels, derived off the golden ratio numbers that traders use to find support and resistance levels. Our next Fibonacci level is $1,717, which will act as resistance. While it is entirely possible that we could see a run up to this price if the buying frenzy continues, we are seeing a dip as the market overheats. I suspect some of the current dip may have been from election speculators taking profits before the final outcome. So, we are faced with a situation similar to our March ETF decision. If Le Pen wins, bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets will have a very strong run ahead of it. On a Le Pen defeat, I suspect we may get a moderate retrace and consolidation before resuming its upward momentum. (I can't see the new influx of new money slowing down, a Le Pen defeat does not solve the EU's financial uncertainty.) Further, looking back at Google search trends, we are not in a hype cycle as yet.

In this latest edition of CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Santori discusses the downfall of the notorious bitcoin-powered dark market Silk Road in fall 2013, and the lasting impact this had on the technology's perception and his practice.  I still kick myself for failing to buy a single item on Silk Road. Yes, I'm a lawyer, and, yes, I'm a square. Yes, most of its wares exceeded my risk tolerance. Still, the Silk Road era was a rarified moment in history, and I was too busy warning people about money transmission to even buy a pair of alpaca socks. In fairness to myself, it was still the early days – the summer of 2013. A bitcoin could be had for about a hundred US dollars. Things were simpler then. Ethereum didn't exist. Nobody was talking about the legality of token sales. I had just returned from a trip to Washington, DC, where, together with other members of the Bitcoin Foundation, we had the first multilateral meetings with the federal government on cryptocurrency. It had been quite a party. FinCEN, IRS, FBI, DEA, SEC, CFPB, CFTC… just about any agency with a potential interest in magical internet money was there to hear us explain it to them. None were believers. In fact, the vibe in the room was clear: bitcoin is for criminals, and these apologists think they're going to change our minds. This 'bitcoin is for criminals' narrative may not have started with the Silk Road, but it was certainly buoyed by it. The marketplace was accessible only via the so-called 'dark web', an anonymous network that required specialized software to use. Once accessed, you could buy anything. Drugs, porn, fake driver's licenses… so long as you paid in bitcoin. It was the first, and, at the time, the only one of its kind. As the Silk Road grew in popularity, so did recognition that bitcoin could be used for illicit activity, and so did the government's interest in it. So, the government shut Silk Road down. It happened in October of 2013, just a couple of months after our grand defense of bitcoin to the very federal agencies that gave the order. I can't say just where I heard the news first, but the reports hit almost at once: posts on social media, emails from clients, calls for comment from the press, communications from the Bitcoin Foundation's PR team. In many of their voices, I heard an unmistakable tinge of panic – the kind of panic usually endemic to tense depositions or bet-the-company litigations – but the only bitcoiner arrested was Ross Ulbricht, the dark market's alleged (and convicted) operator. The rest of the bitcoin citizenry was panicked because they were stakeholders in all of it. Bitcoin was the lifeblood of the Silk Road. At the Bitcoin Foundation, we scrambled to develop messaging. At my law practice, we worked to gauge client exposure and risk. Was crypto prohibition on the horizon? Would bitcoin be deemed contraband? Would the government classify our clients – bitcoin businesses – as entities of primary money laundering concern? If so, an entire industry would be blacklisted from the global financial system... Once news broke, the media speculated widely that bitcoin transaction volumes would drop to near zero, and that bitcoin prices would do the same. After all, bitcoin was for criminals, the narrative went, and now that the greatest criminal use for bitcoins was gone, what was bitcoin good for? At the time, we could only speculate. A systemic limitation of a permissionless, pseudonymous network is a lack of data on the intent of its users. We could only guess how much of bitcoin was tied to Silk Road. Many of us, even if privately, guessed that it was a lot. We were wrong. When we finally looked back on the numbers, volume didn't drop. It soared. Price did fall, but almost immediately recovered and blew past its pre-Silk Road heights. It was astounding. One of our public messaging points at the Bitcoin Foundation was the story that bitcoin was a currency with a heart of gold, now freed from unjust association with dark markets. Its value and its volume were now demonstrably independent from its greatest suspected criminal use, we said. From the beginning, the 'bitcoin is for criminals' narrative had to be fiction. And we were right. Still, this wasn't the whole story. The whole story was a great deal more complex because, almost immediately, dozens of Silk Road copycats begun to spring up. Within a year, there were plenty of dark markets using bitcoin. Some were even using new, more privacy-focused digital currencies that were opaque to forensics and post-hoc analysis. Yet, we also started to see transaction volumes in developing countries start to climb significantly for the first time. People were using bitcoin to improve their lives. Word was getting out that there was an alternative to runaway inflation and fiscal mismanagement inherent in some government money. It just so happened to get out to criminals quicker than it did to most everyone else. Still, Silk Road showed us that bitcoin could be used for criminal transactions just as well as legitimate transactions. Its shuttering showed us the criminal uses of bitcoin were probably much more limited than anyone – even most bitcoiners – suspected. Silk Road changed the way we thought about money. It changed the way we thought about anonymity. It was a rarified moment in history, the effects of which transformed an industry. It changed so much about my government outreach work and my practice of law. But at the time, I couldn't even work up the courage to log on and buy some alpaca socks. I still kick myself.  For more of Santori's writing, read his seminal series on Bitcoin Law, Parts 1, 2 and 3, which provide a basic primer on the state of US law as it relates to cryptocurrencies.

At press time, the price of bitcoin had recovered to $1,511 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), which charts the average price of bitcoin across major exchanges.
 Still, the decline put a damper on what was the technology's run-up to $1,600, as the price peaked just shy of that milestone. Despite the declines, however, bitcoin was still up 2% at time of writing, less than a day after crossing the $1,500 line. CoinDesk reported earlier today that bitcoin had climbed above $1,500 for the first time ever, buoyed by bullishness among the world's digital currency traders. Positive sentiment out of Japan in the wake of legislative actions around the tech has also been cited by some. The move also caps a month of progressive price gains in bitcoin markets, having hovered around an average price of $1,143 on 4th April – signifying a jump of roughly $450 in just over a month.

The government pledged more than a year ago to solve the policy dilemma, wherein Australian businesses are liable for goods-and-services (GST) taxes on any bitcoin sold – as well as taxes should they take them as payment. It's a point of criticism expressed for years by the country's bitcoin community, culminating with last year's commitment. According to statements published today, the government is consulting with its fintech advisory group on the matter – though it cautioned that any material changes would depend on action on the provincial level. The policy document, released by Minister for Small Business Michael McCormack, explained: As for when those changes might be in place, the government didn't offer a firm deadline. In the document, the government also reiterated its support for Australia's digital currency space, declaring that its plans to regulate exchanges under existing AML/KYC statues would help foster development in the sector. ""The Government is committed to facilitating innovation and growth in the digital currency sector and considers that appropriate anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing (AML/CTF) regulation will aid that development,"" it said. It's the latest sign that Australia's government wants to create an accommodative environment for both bitcoin and blockchain activities. Indeed, the country has seen a number of key blockchain developments in the past year, including a bid by the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) to explore the tech (in partnership with blockchain startup Digital Asset Holdings) for use as a possible replacement to its existing settlement systems. ASX told investors this week that the project is ""on track"", and it intends to make a decision on whether to adopt it for full-scale use later this year. Australia image via Shutterstock

That's where the version put forth by Yours aims to stand apart. It's one of the only Lightning-style projects that doesn't require this feature. (One other is Teechan, though it takes a very different direction with the help of secure hardware.) And, as such, it's perhaps the only version that offers a basic form of payment routing that works with bitcoin's current code – a necessary piece of the puzzle for micropayments to work as the project has advertised. For those who are new to the idea, Yours mirrors the popular blog platform Medium, but adds a paywall that requires a tiny fee to access each post. So, it's no surprise then that making bitcoin micropayments easier is key to the firm's business model. The major caveat to the project's version is that the transactions are not as smooth or trust-minimizing as those envisioned for the other alternative implementations of payment channels. Still, Yours CEO Ryan X Charles believes that's a noteworthy achievement in its own right. He told CoinDesk: However, Charles acknowledged that his implementation, too, would be better served by the SegWit upgrade that other versions of Lightning are waiting for. The payment experience is not as seamless without it, he said, and Yours intends to add support for the upgrade, if and when it's added to bitcoin. During an interview and system preview last week, Yours sent CoinDesk a test micropayment – perhaps one of the first Lightning-style transactions using bitcoin – through its test website. Overall, the experience replicates how the project will encourage consumers to access content with small micropayments, or create content, such as blogs, tutorials or news articles in exchange for those payments. Charles stressed that the interface is a work in progress (the demo isn't open to the public yet). Yet, it offers an interesting look at how micropayments for content might work on Yours in the future. The default value to charge readers is $0.10, but authors can change it to any micropayment amount.  To test the service, I put together a short post about cats. Charles then clicked the '10¢ Purchase' button to unlock the rest of my story. However, while the demo works, the user experience is a bit wonky – at least for now. Charles argued that this is partly because, with the growing demand for bitcoin in recent years, the network has seen a rise in average transaction fees. Before our call, Charles set up a payment channel with $10 in value to ensure that he would be able to pay for blog content, as well as the transaction fees required to open and close a micropayment channel. It's the same story for 'cashing out', or redeeming your bitcoin as a content author. In order to make the payment 'worth' the fees, Yours recommends that users wait until they have enough money to send a larger payment.  ""Fees matter a lot for how well the Lightning Network will work,"" Yours co-founder Clemens Ley said, adding that there are about five total fees needed in the micropayment channel lifecycle. Although my cat content only cost him $0.10, Charles said that he needed to send me enough micropayments to close the channel on the bitcoin blockchain. He needed to then click the '10¢ Purchase' button over and over again, until it reached $4, highlighting one of the potential limits to the user experience. ""This is not our fault, it's bitcoin's fault,"" he said. For now, this desire to have a version that's ready today is making Yours a bit of an outlier among Lightning projects. Most developers working on the concept so far favor creating implementations that are SegWit-compatible, since they believe it offers significant improvements (read up on the details here). Going against the grain, Yours prefers making Lightning-style micropayments possible in the short-term, just in case SegWit never gets implemented on bitcoin. Ley further noted that his firm's implementation is written in JavaScript, meaning the software can run in the browser, which in turn makes incorporating the channels into web apps easier. Charles and Ley also perhaps have a slightly different long-term scaling vision than other developers. Charles, at least, is a vocal supporter of on-chain scaling – that is, increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity by making changes to its consensus rules. One popular vision for the Lightning Network depends on the expectation that users will open and close channels just once or twice per year, and then funnel transactions to many different vendors through the same channel. However, Charles said it's possible that Yours users will have reason to open channels more often than that, which he believes on-chain scaling could help with. The CEO further sought to differentiate Yours from past 'micropayments for online content' attempts, such as ChangeTip, the shuttered social media tipping service, and bitcoin-powered video platform Streamium. Besides implementing an advanced micropayments service into the platform, Yours also uses a paywall model, meaning that readers cannot access the content unless they pay. ""Tipping just doesn't encourage people to pay,"" Charles argued. His idea is that everyone wins with a content paywall, because the creator and buyer are making an exchange that they both value.

A former counsel to committees in both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014. In this opinion piece, Harper discusses the longstanding developer conflicts that have come to define bitcoin's governance, arguing that just because there haven't been any results yet, doesn't mean there won't be. 
Two years ago today, politics invaded the world of bitcoin development. It's been non-stop controversy ever since. But Gavin Andresen's essay series, ""Time to Roll Out Bigger Blocks,"" didn't introduce politics to bitcoin. And the cure for what ails its highly controversial development ecosystem isn't getting rid of politics. Bitcoin actually needs more and better politics. How bitcoin politics are practiced is up to the community, which might take some lessons from principles of good government. When Andresen 'went public' with his arguments for bigger blocks, that was the result of political failings on all sides that long predated his writing. Put simply, there are many competing visions for bitcoin's optimal uses, its future, the risks it faces and how to manage them. While minor improvements to the code continue, nobody so far has been a good enough politician to get their broader vision for bitcoin widely adopted. So, what gets people to abide by difficult group decisions, even when the decisions go against them? The US Constitution requires 'due process' in both the Fifth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment. That means that US citizens and residents are supposed to get fairness of two types from their governments: Elections operate along the same lines, giving everyone, including the losers, a say in who will operate the government. Bitcoin is meant, in part, to help people escape the grasps of hugely fallible governments, of course. But, you might ask, isn't bitcoin an apolitical system that resists governance? Governance and government are not the same. Every human system, including bitcoin, has governance. Bitcoin governance is whatever influences or directs the community's decision-making and the software's many encoded policies. Bitcoin is also inherently political. Politics is essentially human relations at scale. When politics are practiced well, we don't notice it. It's politics done poorly, or running against our interests, that we speak ill of, along with the politicians who practice it. With a few noisy exceptions on the social media margins, everyone involved in bitcoin protocol and software development is a good faith actor. So, why are their efforts to move forward drawing heaps of derision and failing to advance their visions? It may be the failure to respond to the demand for due process. Bitcoin is a category buster, so let's talk about due process in terms of economics. In theory, markets work because a large number of buyers and sellers have perfect information, products are homogeneous, transaction costs are low or non-existent and everyone is rational. In practice, buyers and sellers are under-informed, transaction costs are often high and the decision-making of humans is driven away from correct choices by psychological, social, cognitive and emotional factors. There's a 'perfect markets' theory for open-source software development, too, and it especially fails with respect to bitcoin. It holds that developers will perfectly perceive the needs of the community and respond to them, that miners will clearly recognize their economic interests and act in accordance with them, that bitcoin users will all oversee this process well, guiding the other sectors of the bitcoin ecosystem toward its highest and best use. It turns out that everyone isn't an expert in coding, in economics and in perceiving their own interests in an uncertain cryptocurrency future. Miners and users don't follow the 'perfect governance' script very well themselves, but bitcoin development seems to diverge from theory the most. Developers, it turns out, are humans, who have limited time, information and capacity for cognition. Nobody could incorporate the information necessary to advance the bitcoin project consistent with all the goals held for it across the ecosystem. These fascinating 'developer-humans' exhibit human behaviors like trusting people they know and discounting information from people they don't know. That's no basis for criticizing any developer, of course, but the leading development team, Bitcoin 'Core' sometimes seems to speak with a unified voice, and sometimes seems to vanish behind the theory that open-source development is just uncoordinated people from which coding decisions emerge. In a system with worldwide usage and strong network effects, that makes a lot of people feel they are being denied due process. A lot of people feel they aren't getting a say in a project they feel passionate about. It's easy, despite the fact of good faith all around, to fall into thinking that the process is not designed to produce a correct outcome. As a congressional staffer in the 1990s, I participated in a meeting where some academics suggested what the future of telecommunications regulation would look like. ""Bits – everything will be bits,"" they said. The direction of communications technology was obvious already, and perpetuating its regulation was not my preferred goal. But, the meeting was bemusing because in Congress, knowing the right answer is 10% of the problem or less. Getting people convinced of the right answer is the other 90%. There are many right answers for bitcoin's future. Perhaps, if there were more bitcoin politics, more people could be brought on board with one or more of them.

According to a statement from the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of Missouri, Jason Klein plead guilty to the charge yesterday after selling bitcoin to two undercover agents on five occasions between February 2015 and July 2016. Prosecutors argued that he failed to obtain approval from both the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) as well as the Missouri government to operate a money transmission business. All told, Klein sold roughly 98 bitcoins to the agents, according to court documents, accruing about $30,000 over that period and charging commission on top of those sales. An unnamed second individual took part in two of those transactions, the documents state, but the identity of that person was not included in the record. A LocalBitcoins account name identified in court documents shows that Klein has been selling bitcoins since at least 2013, with most of the publicly available feedback posted in that year. According to the site, he was last seen online eight months ago. Klein is being represented by Mark Milton of St Louis-based law firm Husch Blackwell, along with Baker Marquart's Brian Klein (the two are not related), who said in a statement: According to a copy of the plea agreement, Klein faces as many as five years in prison and $250,000 in fines. A sentencing date has not yet been set or publicly announced, the documents show. It's the newest federal case involving a seller of bitcoins based in the US in recent weeks, a development that has prompted observers to decry a larger trend. Last week, Richard Petix of Rochester, New York, plead guilty to unlawful money transmission and lying to federal officials after he sold $13,000 worth of bitcoin to an undercover agent. And in late April, federal authorities raided the home of an Arizona bitcoin trader and advocate, who as of last week was being held pending trial. While it's not immediately clear what factors are driving the recent spate of cases, observers like Carol Van Cleef, financial technology lead for Washington, DC-based law firm BakerHostetler, argue that the case underscores the gray areas in which bitcoin sellers operate in the US today – and the need for more clarification from FinCEN, which released guidance on the issue in 2014. ""I think it requires further explanation from policymakers as to where the lines are,"" she told CoinDesk. Justice statue image via Shutterstock

                            Craig Wright's New Company is Building a Bitcoin Core Competitor                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/craig-wrights-new-company-developing-bitcoin-core-alternative/,"Former Bitcoin Foundation director Jon Matonis doesn't waste any time asserting that his new employer is seeking to disrupt bitcoin's established development process. Matonis, who joined the secretive startup nChain today, is quick to state that this is the ambition of the London and Vancouver-based operation he now claims has 60 full-time employees, including infamous developer Craig Wright. As reported by Reuters, nChain was started by Wright, the 46-year-old computer scientist who claims to be bitcoin's pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto (though he hasn't offered much evidence). To date, nChain hasn't offered much to support its assertions that it's now the industry's best-funded startup either, hinting only that it has received more than $100m from Malta-based high-tech private equity fund SICAV plc as part of an acquisition. Yet, it's a different company that Matonis has in mind in conversation – San Francisco-based blockchain services firm Blockstream. Long the subject of criticism for the significant financial support it provides to developers working on bitcoin's open-source protocol and its primary implementation Bitcoin Core, Blockstream has been villainized for that group's roadmap for scaling bitcoin, specifically its decision to prioritize innovations that don't alter a hard-coded limit on block size. Matonis told CoinDesk: In conversation, Matonis echoes a familiar refrain, that Blockstream and Bitcoin Core are too intertwined, and that Core's roadmap doesn't have broad community support. In Matonis's view, bitcoin can once again return to the days when its blockchain was able to quickly clear its backlog of transactions with virtually no fees, while providing more advanced scripting languages – if only other software implementations gain transaction. Yet, in conversation, Matonis backed away from the idea that nChain was ""taking aim"" at Blockstream, despite his frequent barbs aimed at the company. Rather, Matonis spoke broadly of what he clarified is nChain's broader attempt to introduce choice into a bitcoin software market he described as in need of competition. ""There's a lot of resistance to the Blockstream model of pushing everything to a second layer, pushing SegWit and Lightning as the only solutions,"" he said: Such comments come at time when alternative blockchain networks have come to show progress on flashier, more publicly popular updates to their technology, a development that stands in contrast to bitcoin's now years-long scaling debate and offers some weight to critiques of Core's model. For example, ethereum is hard at work on innovations that would find it redefining how large blockchain networks reach consensus, while litecoin has more quickly adopted innovations originally intended for increasing bitcoin's transaction capacity. (Though it would be wrong to say Core developers aren't progressing). However, ethereum, which lacks a reference implementation, is seen as more welcoming to alternatives, as its parity and geth clients allow developers a choice between competing softwares. (The benefit, proponents say, is that in instances of attack, should one fail, the other could emerge unaffected). Former Bitcoin Core developers Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik, for instance, are two voices that have supported the idea, the latter calling multiple implementations ""healthier than a homogeneous monoculture"" with one reference implementation. Against this backdrop, phase one of the nChain's action plan is to release a software development kit (SDK) that Matonis said will likely be given away for free as a means of proliferating alternatives to Bitcoin Core, used today by 85% of network nodes.  Matonis said the SDK will offer users the ability to boot up ""specialized nodes"" that would enable faster block propagation, a feature he contends would make scaling the bitcoin blockchain through a block size increase easier while appealing to node operators. ""The SDK is going to enable on-chain scaling for bitcoin without degrading decentralization,"" Matonis said. Already, he said nChain has been in talks with miners about the idea. But, how does this work within bitcoin's existing architecture? According to Matonis, nChain's SDK will be different from newer Bitcoin Core competitors including Bitcoin Unlimited and Bcoin, which he framed as being more compatible with Core. Bitcoin Unlimited, for example, is a version of Bitcoin Core with new features added. Likewise, BCoin was built from scratch, but to be compatible with Bitcoin Core. ""nChain allows for other developers to build their own implementations using the techniques and innovations that we've tested here,"" Matonis continued. In this way, Matonis suggested that nChain believes it could gain enough traction on the network to become a popular implementation for other developers, thereby getting rid of the notion that one implementation is big enough to be called a reference at all. He added: Asked how the strategy would impact the bitcoin network, Matonis said that nChain's software will enable network stakeholders to choose between the two implementations, a development that he projects could spur a network split if successful. Should nChain launch its implementation to widespread adoption, Matonis suggested that miners and node operators could be forced to choose between two competing versions of bitcoin's blockchain history – one kept by Bitcoin Core and the other by nChain. ""This is the governance model for bitcoin, there’s no other governance model. If you can't get traction with pull requests, you launch software propagation battles, and when one reference implementation has greater than 50% or 75%, you can attempt a fork of the network,"" Matonis explained. Such a scenario has long been the subject of fears in the bitcoin development community. For example, the idea that a hard fork could possibly disrupt the validity of the bitcoin blockchain was factor cited by Bitcoin Core developers in their support for their proposed scaling solutions. But, given the risk of creating two separate bitcoin assets in the process, why not build a competing blockchain network? According to Matonis, the answer is hashing power. While cryptocurrency markets such as ethereum and litecoin have recently hit notable highs, it's bitcoin's miners that Matonis believes makes it more valuable. 
""It will make bitcoin more competitive against altcoins,"" Matonis said of the implementation, invoking the idea that the design is similar to that seen in the open-source Linux project. Still, Matonis reports nChain is working on larger goals to make bitcoin useful beyond just being a store of value, one he suggested would have greater societal benefits. ""I want to elevate the sector beyond fintech to a more general computation market for enterprise computing,"" he said, concluding: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream and Purse, the creators of Bcoin.

Overall, the price of bitcoin has gained nearly 5% across global exchanges, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, to reach its highest value ever recorded. The gains mark the third consecutive day that bitcoin's price has set a new all-time high, and the fourth time it has done so over the last five days. According to data from CoinDesk, the development also follows a period in which volume has shifted to new markets, namely Japan, where newly enacted regulations appear to have set the stage for a period of more robust trade in the market.  Over the last 24 hours, more than 50% of trading has taken place in Japanese yen, according to data service CryptoCompare. Notably, the majority of US trading has also seen a migration to Gemini – long one of the lesser traded exchanges and perhaps the one that has most targeted the institutional investor demographic.   Still, it's difficult to tell exactly what is driving the market. Not only has the market seen its largest US dollar exchange fall victim to banking issues in recent weeks, but bitcoin's price gains are coinciding with the appreciation of a range of other blockchain-based assets, providing evidence that speculation in other markets may be a rising tide lifting all boats. In recent sessions, both ether (the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain) and litecoin (an alternative payment-focused cryptocurrency) have also hit all-time or multi-year highs.

                            Bitcoin Price Passes $1,400 to Hit Highest Value in History                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-1400-highest-in-history/," The price of bitcoin rose above $1,400 today, setting a new all-time high. At press time, the cryptocurrency's price had climbed to as much as $1,407.05, a 4.4% increase for the day, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). This latest price increase builds upon the gains that the cryptocurrency has experienced over the last several sessions – during which markets have repeatedly risen to new highs – and that have effectively rekindled bitcoin's early 2017 momentum. It also comes as prices in ether markets (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum network) rose to new all-time highs as well this morning. After spiking to new highs in January, the cryptocurrency's price languished for several weeks in March after the SEC rejected the bitcoin exchange-traded fund proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. While bitcoin prices hit $1,325.81 in the hours before the ruling, they went on to fall below $900 later that month, according to the BPI. After bottoming out at $891.51 on 25th March, the cryptocurrency's price resumed its upward climb, rising to fresh highs of $1,335.56 on 27th April, $1,343.59 on 28th April and $1,348.65 on 30th April. Bitcoin prices are currently averaging $1,402.03, according to data from the BPI. Pole vault image via Shutterstock

Soft launched in February, the paid email platform enabled users to send surveys, tasks and requests to curated lists of individuals and professionals, incentivizing those actions with small bitcoin payments. Original users included what 21 described as ""famous people"", largely VCs backing the firm, including Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. Starting today, however, anyone can apply to join to create a profile page and join 21 Lists based on their preferred area of expertise.  In a blog post, the firm heralded the move as one that would open the door for users to engage in ""microconsulting"" – a way to earn additional income by offering their expertise to individuals outside their social network. The company went on to explain: Further, some lists will be subject to periodic reviews to ensure the quality of responses does not degrade, 21 added. For example, the firm said individuals in lists that target specific digital currency users will periodically ask users to sign transactions to verify that they still qualify to receive tasks in this area. The move is the latest that finds 21, one of bitcoin's best-funded startups, evolving its offering from a focus on bitcoin mining hardware to one centered on disrupting social media networks through micropayments.

                            MimbleWimble: Silly Sounding Tech Could Seriously Reform Bitcoin                        ",Catheryne Nicholson,https://www.coindesk.com/mimblewimble-silly-sounding-tech-seriously-reform-bitcoin/,"Catheryne Nicholson is the CEO and founder of BlockCypher, a blockchain web services startup. In this opinion piece, Nicholson speaks out about the dysfunctional state of bitcoin's community and why she believes new tech called MimbleWimble could help save it.  The state of bitcoin today is highly discouraging. Watching grown men hurl insults at each other on Reddit and Twitter is just sad. When I became involved in 2013, bitcoin's potential seemed endless. It was heralded as a possible solution for micropayments, remittances, microfinance, parking meters, email spam and so on. Many women, myself included, believed in bitcoin as a means to address world problems of poverty by providing access to capital for the remaining three-quarters of the world. As time passed, I became discouraged that many needed use cases did not come to fruition. Startups attempting to build companies with those business models have died. Anything involving small payments in bitcoin has been mostly eliminated due to high fees. The most popular use case is as a store of value. It's not to say that isn't useful: in the growing number of countries with devaluating currencies, bitcoin is an attractive alternative. Bitcoin has had an indelible impact as a groundbreaking technology. But it's disheartening that it has stalled in doing more. There are fundamental issues that will likely never be solved, as evidenced by the two-year debate on how to scale bitcoin. The community is more divisive than ever. I can't help but think part of the reason it's so dysfunctional is because it's devoid of women. Women (or any rational person) do not want to participate in this dystopian community: it's juvenile and filled with vitriol. Bitcoin desperately needs a Patronus Charm, ""a pure, protective magical concentration of happiness and hope.” [1] My disappointment in bitcoin caused me to look at the blossoming landscape of alternate blockchains: eg litecoin, zcash, monero, ethereum and dash have all grown in market size and popularity. It's clear that more alternative coins (altcoins) will develop innovative solutions and come to market. This is why MimbleWimble caught my interest. As a brief background, the original MimbleWimble white paper was placed by someone called Tom Elvis Jedusor (Voldemort’s French name in JK Rowling's Harry Potter book series) on a bitcoin research channel in July 2016. Tom's white paper ""Mimblewimble"" (a tongue-tying curse used in ""The Deathly Hallows"") was a blockchain proposal that could theoretically increase privacy, scalability and fungibility. It remained theoretical until recently. At the end of 2016, someone named Ignotus Peverell (the original owner of the invisibility cloak, if you know your Harry Potter characters) started a Github project called Grin, and began turning the MimbleWimble paper into something real. Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician at Blockstream, presented on this work in January 2017 at Stanford University’s Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017 conference. More recently, Ignotus posted a technical introduction to MimbleWimble and Grin. It took me a while to wrap my head around MimbleWimble. The more I internalized it, the more hopeful I became that something more magical than bitcoin could appear. I will attempt to explain MimbleWimble and why what it proposes – privacy, freedom of choice, equal access, fungibility, and sustainable growth over time – are so important. Privacy matters, a lot. One of the most important rights we have is the right to privacy. It’s our right to “keep a domain around us, which includes all those things that are part of us, such as our body, home, property, thoughts, feelings, secrets and identity."" [2] I consider privacy extremely important. It's very apparent how valuable it is when you lose it or when someone violates it. In my 20s, I was stalked. A person whom I had met in passing on a military base waited for me after work and surreptitiously followed me home. He did this for several weeks – all unbeknownst to me – until one day he knocked on my door and told me he had been following me and professed his undying love. I immediately slammed the door and called the local and military police. I lived alone in the woods and was so freaked out that I moved. Only someone who has been stalked can understand how frightening this experience was. To this day, it affects many of my behaviors to guard my privacy. Physical trespass of privacy is often preceded by online privacy violations. Recent events, such as Congress granting ISPs (internet service providers) the right to sell your personal information – browsing habits, app usage history, purchasing habits, location data – are very concerning. As Luke Mulks from Brave elegantly wrote, ""[Y]our digital data trail is the evidence of your human presence online. Your data is valuable, private, and most important, it’s yours."" If we cannot rely on our legislature to protect our constitutional rights (can we rely on them for anything anymore?), technology needs to intercede to make it harder for greedy capitalists to put your privacy up for sale. Privacy extends to what to share publicly about what we buy or whom we donate to. These transactions should not be open for all to see. Women, especially those trying to escape repressive social or economic conditions, have a dire need to stay anonymous. That's a fundamental flaw in bitcoin: every transaction and address balance is available for the world to watch and track. There are some things you can do to hide your transaction, such as tumbling, but you need to go out of your way to use them and they are breakable. Privacy oriented cryptocurrencies like monero and zcash improve privacy significantly. In monero, the transaction is not natively private, but relies on ring signatures to mask exchanges. Zcash leverages a technology called zk-snarks to build private transactions, which is a huge improvement. However, it still requires a lot of extra resources to build a confidential transaction, so most users still issue their transactions ""in the clear"" (clear vs shielded counts). MimbleWimble is natively private. There are no ring signatures or zero-knowledge proofs on top of a transparent bitcoin-like transaction. In a MimbleWimble transaction, all values are fully obscured. There are no reusable or identifiable addresses. Every transaction looks the same to an outside party. The two properties verified in a MimbleWimble transaction are: To verify no new money has been created, you must demonstrate that the sum of outputs minus the inputs equals zero. To verify key ownership, the transacting parties must legitimately prove their public and private keys exist to authorize the transaction. MimbleWimble uses a blinding element to obscure all values – transaction amounts and keys – while holding true basic mathematical facts. The blinding element relies on multiplying and adding secret factors to obscure real values.  Still don't think this is a big deal? MimbleWimble offers other extensive benefits that indicate it could form the foundation of the kind of network bitcoin was meant to be. By obscuring all values, MimbleWimble provides full privacy and gives you the choice of what to reveal. It's similar to donor levels in various non-profits. You’ll see the range a donation was made for, but you don’t necessarily know the exact donation. Both the donor and the non-profit know exactly how much was donated, but no one else needs to know. This ""right to privacy gives us the ability to choose which parts in this domain can be accessed by others, and to control the extent, manner and timing of the use of those parts we choose to disclose."" [2] Another aspect of bitcoin that disturbs me greatly is there is little opportunity left for an average person to participate in securing the network. The requirement of a highly specialized and expensive chip for bitcoin mining – the ASIC – has almost eliminated anyone from becoming a bitcoin miner, whose primary responsibility is validating transactions and placing them into blocks. The mining community is now heavily centralized and this has greatly contributed to bitcoin's woes. The ability to grow over time while still providing equal opportunity to participate are key tenets of Ignotus' Grin implementation of MimbleWimble. Grin is designed to be ASIC resistant, so that anyone who wants to try mining can buy a widely available GPU chip at a local Best Buys or online for a reasonable price. Making MimbleWimble ASIC resistant democratizes access. I’ve even toyed with the idea of building a GPU miner with my kids to see what it can do. Another way to safeguard equal access over time is to ensure the blockchain network doesn't get dragged to a standstill when transaction volume increases. This is the core issue in the bitcoin block-size debate: there are more transactions than can fit into a 1Mb block. As long as there's a restrictive size limit, there will be a capacity issue. A dirty little secret is that to get around scalability issues, almost all payment processors and exchanges do off-chain transactions. Which begs the question: why bother using a cryptocurrency with blockchain? Increasing usage will increase transaction volume. So how do you ensure that a block size can continue to accommodate volume increases? By streamlining each block. The principle is similar to simplifying equations. If there are terms that are identical on both sides of an equation, you can cut them: MimbleWimble maintains that if an output spends an input, you no longer have to keep them because they cancel each other out. This greatly cuts down the amount of data you have to store and process. The only data that nodes keep is unspent outputs and block headers. Instead of thinking of blockchain capacity in terms of number of transactions, MimbleWimble is designed to grow with the number of users. The streamlined blocks make growth sustainable over time as the transaction data set does not continue to get bigger. This increases privacy since transaction data gets removed and it also enables fungibility. Fungibility is the ability for equal units to be interchangeable. Let's say I give you a dollar – either as a coin or a paper note. The Federal Reserve prints the paper dollar and the US Mint produces the coin dollar, but both are equal. Neither is lesser or greater than the other and you can chose to use a dollar coin or bill interchangeably. This is a key characteristic of currency: equal units must be interchangeable, or fungible. The US dollar is fungible. Bitcoin is not. The bitcoin blockchain keeps every single input and output forever and so each coin carries a legacy. It's similar to equation (9) above. Another dirty little secret is that when picking which transactions to process – in addition to the fee – payment processors, miners, and exchanges will look at the inputs (ie 7+3+5+4+2) to assess the quality of the transaction. The consequence is one bitcoin is not fungible with another. The most valued bitcoins are called 'coinbase transactions', which are the ones created when a block is found. They are newly minted and 'clean' and some parties pay a premium to buy them. A hierarchy in coin quality develops. The consequence is, if you receive bitcoins that have inputs that are tainted (eg they have been used in a dark market), spending them may become increasingly difficult. In MimbleWimble, because the (7+3+5+4+2) inputs and outputs are all discarded when spent, each coin is exactly equal to the other. In other words, MimbleWimble coins are interchangeable and fungible. I'm very hopeful seeing the accelerating pace of research and innovation in public blockchains. If privacy and scalability are solved, MimbleWimble could be the Patronus Charm for bitcoin, perhaps as a complementary sidechain. Imagine what a universal fungible digital coin could enable with access for everyone. One hesitation I have, however, is that many people developing it have taken on Harry Potter-themed pseudonyms. It's understandable given the personal attacks rampant in the community, but it does conjure a mystical aura. I’m glad Andrew Poelstra, a highly qualified real figure, is actively involved with MimbleWimble. I hope I can add my voice to the mix, also as a real person. I realize that by not using a pseudonym, I'm opening myself to the troll armies. I’ve attempted to explain why MimbleWimble is interesting to me. I hope it intrigues enough people and inspires both men AND women to engage early; it would be great if this community doesn’t wind up as a testosterone-filled boys club. Apparently, Merope Riddle (Lord Voldemort's mother) is already very involved in MimbleWimble’s development. I believe it’s worth learning, participating in its genesis, and helping to develop a healthy community around it. Hogwarts/Harry Potter image via Shutterstock

                            What Bitcoin Traders Should Know About Fundamental Analysis                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-know-fundamental-analysis/,"While there are many different methods for evaluating the price of bitcoin, fundamental analysis may be the most integral for figuring out its true value. Fundamental analysis is the evaluation of economic, financial and other key variables, known as fundamentals, to determine a security's true value. This differs from technical analysis (the counterpart to fundamental analysis) in that the former is more interested in looking at a security's price movements to make better-informed decisions. When evaluating bitcoin, though, investors are keen to evaluate key aspects of the cryptocurrency's underlying technology, for example, how its scaling challenges might affect the digital currency's value. After all, if the digital currency's transactions grow costly and time-consuming on account of block size limitations, this could reduce demand, in turn lowering the price. While investors use fundamental analysis to evaluate different asset classes, such as equities and fiat currencies, several analysts assert that using this approach to evaluate bitcoin is more complex. For instance, investors can evaluate a company's stock by looking at certain items on its balance sheet, but bitcoin does not produce revenue or earnings numbers. Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to this situation, telling CoinDesk: ""It's hard to derive an even remotely precise valuation for bitcoin from future cashflows"", the way you can for other assets such as General Motors stock. As a result, traders interested in conducting fundamental analysis on bitcoin have developed ""a whole new set of metrics,"" according to Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare. However, even though bitcoin has been described as a new asset class, the same rules that apply to fiat currencies also apply to cryptocurrencies, said Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management. ""All the laws of economics apply – in full – to cryptocurrencies,"" he said. As a result, he emphasized that the starting point for all fundamental analysis should be the supply and demand that drives prices. Several variables affect bitcoin demand, including user adoption, transaction activity and trading. Many analysts noted the importance of user adoption, which is crucial to a cryptocurrency's long-term viability. As for what drives user adoption, the analysts said money can have many uses. At its most basic level, money is a store of value, a medium of exchange and a unit of account. Outside of small circles, bitcoin has never really been used as a unit of account, said Enneking. But bitcoin has managed to gain significant traction as a medium of exchange. Hundreds of companies – including eBay and PayPal – have agreed to accept the digital currency since its inception in 2009. In addition, the number of confirmed transactions per day has generally followed a steady, upward trend, according to data from Blockchain. Transactions started surging in early 2012, rising from more than 7,000 per day at the start of April 2012 to more than 300,000 per day now. While this data is informative, Eliosoff asserted that it's not the best indicator, because many blockchain transactions are ""generated by automated systems and don't represent economic activity, [especially] on scalable chains with low fees."" Instead, traders must figure out which transactions are an actual person sending to or accepting from another person. But as bitcoin obtains more widespread adoption and retailers aren't seeing increasing sales via bitcoin, there's been a major shift in focusing on the cryptocurrency as a medium of exchange and to a store of value, concluded Enneking. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, said similar things, telling CoinDesk that the extent to which bitcoin is perceived as a store of value is a major driver of the digital currency's price. While demand for bitcoin can be a complex study, supply is a bit more straightforward. The bitcoin protocol limits the total number of units at 21 million, and 16.3m bitcoins were in circulation at the time of reporting. Further, the rate of new supply is also determined by the bitcoin protocol. This contrasts sharply with the traditional monetary system, in which central banks have the ability to print money whenever they want. However, there are some caveats that affect bitcoin's supply. For starters, Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, supposedly holds roughly 1.1m bitcoins which have not moved since they were mined. And many people in the bitcoin community think they won't ever be, seeing these coins as ""dead bitcoins."" Past that, it is impossible to know just how many ""dead bitcoins"" there really are, noted Enneking. That's because for the first several years of bitcoin's existence, units of the digital currency didn't have much monetary value. When the price began moving upward, stories of people throwing away hard drives that held the private keys for their bitcoins were commonplace. Analysts also noted the key role major events play in determining the price of bitcoin. These incidents are sometimes directly related to bitcoin, such as the hack of a major exchange, or a setback in the community's push to solve the scaling dilemma. However, Enneking told CoinDesk: BitMEX's Hayes also spoke to the importance of macroeconomic events, emphasizing that ones fueling instability usually bolster alternative assets like bitcoin. ARK Invest's Chris Burniske agreed. During times of economic turmoil, bitcoin can act as a ""disaster hedge,"" he said. By leveraging fundamental analysis, bitcoin traders can get a better sense of the cryptocurrency's true value and get a better sense of whether it's a good time to buy or sell. However, some analysts criticize fundamental analysis because it reflects more what a security should be worth than what its actual market price is. Relying too much on fundamental analysis, without also using technical analysis, could cause a trader to buy or sell at a less-than-ideal time, they said. To manage this risk, bitcoin traders can combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis. For example, a fundamental analyst might look at several indicators of demand, concluding that bitcoin is underbought, and then leverage technical analysis by reading charts to find the best entry point. Alternatively, a trader might use technical analysis to determine that it's a good time to sell, and then leverage fundamental analysis to confirm this view by looking at key drivers of demand.

                            $1,300 and Counting: What's Next For Bitcoin Prices?                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/1300-counting-whats-next-bitcoin-prices/," The price of bitcoin is once again trading near an all-time high. After about a month of uncertainty following the rejection of a major investment vehicle, bitcoin prices reached $1,343.59, a new all-time high on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index on Thursday, breaking the previous record of $1,325.81, set in March. Yet, even after this modest pullback, analysts are predicting bitcoin prices will continue their steady, upward climb, pointing to factors such as technical progress in the wider cryptocurrency space as well as the growing use of bitcoin in emerging markets as factors pushing its price higher. But with the price of bitcoin up 200% year-over-year, many are now asking where the digital asset will trade going forward. Analysts largely agreed it's up. When identifying bitcoin's psychological price level, more than one pointed to $1,500, though there was far from an even consensus. Tuur Demeester, economist and cryptocurrency trader, for example, emphasized the importance of bitcoin's yuan-denominated price. ""¥8,000 seems [to be] an important psychological level,"" he said, adding: At press time, bitcoin was trading at just ¥7,800 (roughly $1,130), a differential no doubt influenced by the current freeze on certain exchanges services in China. Elsewhere, traders were even more bullish on prices. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged digital currency platform BitMEX, took perhaps the most bullish approach among analysts polled, asserting that $2,000 could be a reasonable target for the asset. Likewise, cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Tim Enneking predicted that the cryptocurrency's price will ""march to $1,500"", but perhaps stop in that range. Still, Enneking told CoinDesk that bitcoin prices will pause at this level as traders take profits and adopt a ""wait-and-see"" approach. Enneking asserted that without such a pause, ""it will be too much upward movement too fast to sustain"". Marius Rupsys, cryptocurrency trader and co-founder of fintech startup InvoicePool, was also hesitant. He emphasized that once bitcoin reaches a fresh, all-time high, it is difficult to predict exactly when traders will begin taking profits. Of course, given that many bitcoin traders identify as long-term bulls, some may simply balk it this question, raising up the digital currency's performance as another sign it's destined to become a viable, and valuable, alternative to fiat options.

Richard Petix of Rochester, NY was originally charged with making false statements in late 2015, according to court records, after he told probation officials in October of that year that he wasn’t using any computer device, as required following of a 2009 conviction on a charge of knowingly transporting child pornography in interstate commerce. Yet Petix, the US Attorney’s Office for the Western District of New York said this week, had been operating a bitcoin trading business, and on 3rd December 2015, sold 37 bitcoins (an amount worth roughly $13,000, according to then-current prices) to an undercover agent. The office said in a statement: Prosecutors further alleged that Petix sold more than $200,000 worth of bitcoin between August 2014 and December 2015. Yet court documents show that one point, the defense argued that the allegation of unlawful money transmission wasn’t valid, given that Petix didn’t charge a fee for those transactions. Petix was initially set to go on trial on 1st May. According to court documents, he will attend a sentencing hearing on 14th August. Justice statue image via Shutterstock

                            Florida's Money Laundering Statute Won't Affect Most Bitcoin Users                        ",Andrew Hinkes,https://www.coindesk.com/floridas-money-laundering-statute-wont-affect-most-bitcoin-users/,"Andrew 'Drew' Hinkes is counsel at Berger Singerman LLP, a business law firm in Florida. Hinkes represents companies and entrepreneurs in state and federal commercial litigation matters, representation of court-appointed fiduciaries and electronic discovery issues. In this opinion piece, Hinkes looks at the potential impact of the recent court decision in Florida that centered in part on the definitions of both bitcoin and money transmission. 
Florida's legislature is considering a bill that would add ""virtual currency"" to the definition of ""monetary instruments"" covered within its anti-money laundering (AML) statute. This proposed revision seems to be a direct reaction to the dismissal order in State vs Espinoza (which remains on appeal), and that would close a loophole in Florida's money transfer statute. But, however ominous it may sound, this change would only impact a fraction of virtual currency activities, so the new definition is likely to have a minor impact on its use in Florida. One of the key innovations of bitcoin and other virtual currencies is the ability to transact pseudonymously. Most virtual currency transactions do not require the transacting parties to know each other, meet face-to-face or directly interact to exchange value. Most often, virtual currency users transact across the internet, through QR codes, trade on exchanges or buy and sell their bitcoins via bitcoin ATMs. For the purposes of this law, the lack of direct communication between parties is critical, and demonstrates the narrow impact of the proposed legislation. Florida's Money Laundering Statute, based upon a similar federal statute (18 U.S.C. §1956 1998) covers nine different behaviors. First, it punishes ""transactions"" wherein a person, ""knowing that the property involved in a financial transaction represents the proceeds of some form of unlawful activity,"" conducts or attempts to conduct such a ""financial transaction"" which in fact involves the proceeds of ""specified unlawful activity"" either: Florida's statute also covers ""transportation"" type of infractions including where any person transports or attempts to transport a monetary instrument or funds: Florida’s statute also covers financial transactions which ""involve property or proceeds which an investigative or law enforcement officer, or someone acting under such officer’s direction, represents as being derived from, or as being used to conduct or facilitate, specified unlawful activity,"" when the person’s conduct or attempted conduct is undertaken with the intent: Any charge brought under this statute requires that the party charged with its violation have intent and/or actual knowledge. Espinoza was charged with violating §896.101(3)(c), Fla. Stat., (relating to law enforcement officers), and (5)(a) and (b) (discussing the appropriate punishment for the violation based upon the amount of value at issue). The court dismissed that charge against Espinoza based upon three separate defects: Although the bill may clarify that virtual currency now qualifies as a monetary instrument, the other two issues identified by Judge Pooler in the Espinoza opinion remain unaddressed by this bill. Because money laundering charges under ch. 896, require that at least one of the two parties to the transaction have knowledge and or intent, and a charge must be supported by evidence of that intent and or knowledge, most virtual currency transactions will still not factually qualify for prosecution under this law. While there may be greater risk to users of virtual currency who actually interact personally with others, or have actual knowledge of the motives to exchange value, the proposed statutory change will probably not affect most virtual currency users.

The definition included in the bill reads: The measure is on the cusp of becoming state law, public records show. Lawmakers have finished drafting the bill following a conference period, according to LegiScan, a legislation data service provider. The state's lower chamber initially passed the bill by a 78–21 vote, with the senate approving the measure unanimously a month later in a 34–0 vote. The bill, though subject to approval by the state’s governor, Democrat Jim Justice, forms part of a larger legislative trend happening in the US today.

Reports from websites include Freedom’s Phoenix and Phoenix New Times indicate that Thomas Costanzo was arrested on 20th April for unlawful possession of ammunition stemming from a prior conviction. The arrest resulted from a home raid led by the US Department of Homeland Security. Yet warrant documents obtained by Freedom’s Phoenix suggest that authorities are investigating other aspects of Costanzo’s activities, including his use or sale of digital currencies including bitcoin, ethereum and dash. Costanzo, who uses the moniker ""Morpheus Titania"" online, operates a bitcoin-centered website that was updated as of 3rd April. According to the site, Costanzo has been a full-time bitcoin trader for the past three years, while also selling bitcoin miners and ATMs. One of the warrant documents approves the search for ""digital currency including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Dash, or other digital coin 'altcoin', or any other financial instrument believed to be proceeds of money laundering or drug sales"". Further along, the warrant identifies records for ""digital Bitcoin transactions"" and devices capable of retaining ""virtual currency applications [and] crypto-currency wallet applications"" as other items for seizure. A complaint and subsequent indictment filed in the US District Court for the District of Arizona, however, only account for the allegedly unlawful possession of ammunition. New Times suggested in its report that additional charges could be filed, but its unclear at this time whether that will happen. According to Freedom's Phoenix, Costanzo is scheduled to appear at a detention hearing on 27th April. Police car image via Shutterstock

                            Antbleed: Bitcoin's Newest New Controversy Explained                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/antbleed-bitcoins-newest-new-controversy-explained/," A mining chip vulnerability that could potentially be used to remotely shut off bitcoin mining machines was revealed yesterday – with a fix from the manufacturer following shortly after. Involving controversial mining chip manufacturer Bitmain, the issue is what some are calling a ""backdoor"" in the code that controls its hardware, offering the company a way to remotely shut off the miners. Since the code, released anonymously last evening, is vulnerable to attackers, the main concern is whether, in a worst-case scenario, it could be misused. The fear is that bad actors could exploit the vulnerability to switch off bitcoin mining equipment in bulk, and with Bitmain supplying such a large number of machines to the market, the impact could have catastrophic implications for the bitcoin ecosystem. Known as Antbleed (a title bestowed by the website that dramatized its release), the vulnerability is open-source, making it easy to verify. Leading up to the reveal, a group was told about the code feature, with some developers, such as Satoshi Labs CEO Marek Palatinus independently verifying that the backdoor exists and that it can be used to stop Bitmain miners on trigger. Bitmain quickly responded with a fix that erases this part of its mining firmware. Further, its team claimed that the feature was never finished, and that it was intended to help customers recover stolen miners, a past problem for industry firms. The statement reads: Much of the recent buzz in the community is around whether the so-described ""backdoor"" could have been used for malicious purposes, for example, to shut off a miner if it wasn’t complying with rules set by Bitmain. Adding to the confusion is that bitcoin developments have been highly politicized lately, with Bitmain often sitting at the center of bitcoin’s long-standing scaling debate, opposing proposals authored by members of the Bitcoin Core community. For example, the vulnerability reveal follows allegations that the manufacturer was using a secret mining advantage to boost its profits. In conversation with CoinDesk, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun might have summed up the issue and surrounding atmosphere the best: Still, it seems that there are other reasons to be concerned about the backdoor. Since it can be exploited by bad actors from outside the company, the mining chips are now viewed as a security risk to the network. Every one to 11 minutes, according to the open-source patch introduced on July 12th, 2016, the machines send calls back to a Bitmain server. The idea is that the mining manufacturer can scan for identifying information about the mining chip, including its serial number and IP address. But, arguably the biggest concern is that the code isn't limited to use by certain people or companies, so it can be exploited by any man-in-the-middle or attacks coming from the same DNS server. ""Even without Bitmain being malicious, the API is unauthenticated and would allow any MITM, DNS or domain hijack to shut down Antminers globally,"" the Antbleed website reads, further outlining concerns about the potential for technical or political misuse. Whether or not it was intended to be malicious seems to make up the bulk of the surrounding debate, and so far, it seems that sentiment has broken along the lines of the scaling debate. Still, some broke away from so-called party lines. ""This was reckless of them to leave the unfinished feature in the code since this represents a major security issue,"" said Henry Brade, CEO of bitcoin service provider Prasos, a past defender of Bitcoin Core’s scaling proposals. F2pool operator Wang Chun further noted that, he isn’t particularly worried about miners within his pool falling victim to manipulation by Bitmain. He noted in conversation with CoinDesk that it doesn’t seem like the company ever used it to shut down miners. ""They have been able to do that for a long time, but they didn't,"" he said. Guy Corem, former CEO of Israeli mining chip maker Spondoolies-Tech, chalked up the controversy to ""incompetence” and ""negligence"", rather than malicious intent. ""It make sense they wanted to develop such feature and it also make sense they didn't complete it and abandon it,"" he added. Further, he cited Spondoolies-Tech’s own past issues with stolen mining equipment. Still, some in the community are skeptical of Bitmain’s response. ""Denial of many people is unbelievable. 'Antbleed' is not bug or mistake. The purpose of the code is clear; shut down miner on remote flag,"" Palatinus tweeted. Others have raised concerns about this vulnerability being made public, since outsiders can then take advantage of the attack vector. Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo argued that owners of these bitcoin miners needed to know about the potential vulnerability in order to fix it. ""The issue is it's already integrated in a ton of deployed hardware,"" he said, adding: The issue was first reported to Bitmain on Github in September 2016. One question is how prevalent the practice is in bitcoin. Secret backdoors seem to be par for the course in the technology world, often drawing security-minded critics as they're uncovered. Do other hardware manufacturers have the same vulnerability? Two mining manufacturers, at least, claim that they don’t. ""Our hardware doesn't [have] such issues, we [don’t] offer remote update for firmware – it's the customer's decision update them or not,” said blockchain startup Bitfury Group CIO Alex Petrov. ""My miner has no ASICBoost or backdoor,"" Jack Liao, CEO of mining LightningAsic, told CoinDesk. Along with the details about the backdoor, those who detected it released a patch that closes it up with a single line of code. Still, there are lingering worries that the vulnerability betrays a weakness in the bitcoin network – namely, it's lack of mining chip makers. No clear data is available about how many miners are running this software, but Bitmain is one the largest chip manufacturers in the space, with bolder estimates suggesting it produces 70% of all mining chips. That the backdoor could be used to impact any of those chips is unsurprisingly alarming to advocates that the network be ""decentralized"" and open to competition that enables different actors to engage on it. For now, the impact seems to be that Bitmain will take action to look at the rest of its codebase in order to spot other vulnerabilities. ""The controversy around this code has brought our attention to improve the design in order to address vulnerabilities that were pointed out by the community recently,"" its statement reads. Still, others are lamenting the state of the drama and conversation around the issue, noting how quickly it became politicized. Rizun concluded: Image via AntBleed website

Prices hit a high of $1,330.72 at press time, surpassing the previous all-time high of roughly $1,325.81 set on 10th March in the run-up to what was ultimately a rejection of a proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) by the SEC. At press time, the price had edged up past the $1,330 mark. The boost comes amid an increasingly active time for the industry as it relates to public markets, as the SEC has since revealed that it is reviewing a petition submitted by the Bats BZX Exchange that will find it reconsidering the listing of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF. The price move caps a bullish month for the digital currency, which on 1st April averaged just under $1,100, an increase of roughly 20% in just a span of weeks. However, the event coincides also with developments in the bitcoin exchange sector that suggest the health of its infrastructure may be wavering. Bitfinex, BTC-e and OKCoin, three leading exchanges, have all faced banking pressures in recent weeks some analysts believe could be creating artificial price pressures. Elsewhere in the exchange ecosystem, prices are far higher than observed on the BPI, with bitcoin trading at $1,430 on Bitfinex, roughly $100 higher than prices observed on GDAX, a regulated US exchange where the price was $1,331, at one point earlier in the day. The divergence in pricing began a week ago, but has shown no signs of narrowing. As for how this is affecting sentiment among Bitfinex exchange users, it seems investor confidence is stabilizing, with the total observed in a cold wallet held by the exchange declining of late. Also on the decline is the premium buyers at Bitfinex are paying for bitcoin, with the following chart illustrating the price differential between the exchange and another market competitor, UK-based Bitstamp.  As for now, the exchange indicates it is looking for another correspondent bank, though in remarks, the company's representatives have framed this as an uphill battle. Overall, traders and investors remain optimistic about the long-term price of bitcoin, as well as the health of the market, noting the abundance of available exchanges currently in place to support trading activity.

In this entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Brito discusses one of the first major regulatory hearings centered on bitcoin in the US.  On 18th November, 2013, the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee held the US Congress's first hearing on bitcoin. These days, such meetings hardly raise an eyebrow. Back then, though, the hearing was a big deal for obvious reasons – and I testified. First, it's important to remember this hearing came at the end of a string of announcements that, while aiming to clarify how the industry was regulated, ended up stoking fears among users. In March of that year, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidance applying anti-money laundering rules to bitcoin businesses. Then in August, the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) began its inquiry by unceremoniously subpoenaing 22 bitcoin companies and investors. And lastly, in October, federal agents shut down the Silk Road (a dark market largely powered by bitcoin). Against this backdrop, it was with great tension that many were watching the bitcoin hearing's webcast live around the globe. What would the Secret Service say about bitcoin? How about the Department of Justice (DoJ)? Or the US Treasury? What effect would it have on the ecosystem?  My bitcoin journey began on 9th February, 2011, when I listened to episode 287 of one of my favorite podcasts, ""Security Now"". Steve Gibson spent 45 minutes explaining in detail this crazy new invention called bitcoin, and he was in awe of it. I was, too. Once you understood how bitcoin worked, it was obvious what a profoundly disruptive force it would be. And working in technology policy in Washington, DC, it was clear to me that its regulatory implications were vast. So I started researching, especially as it related to bitcoin and the law, which came up pretty sparse. I even asked around DC, but both the policy shops and government agencies hadn't heard much. So, in April, in Time, I published what would be the first article about bitcoin in a mainstream publication. At that time, I was directing the technology policy program at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University, and while I worked on a number of tech policy issues, bitcoin was increasingly taking up more of my time. I was developing a reputation in DC as the guy to call if you had a bitcoin question. The questions at first came here and there, but by 2013, they were frequent.  Some time in the spring 2013, I got asked by staff from the US Senate Homeland Security Committee to come in and talk about bitcoin. I accepted. And that's when I first met John Collins, a staffer for chairman Tom Carper. John had become very interested in the technology and had started the inquiry at the committee (just over a year later, he would join Coinbase to head up its government outreach). In the meantime, he and his colleagues were asking serious and thoughtful questions about bitcoin, its illicit uses and its innovative potential. It was refreshing that the committee staff were approaching the issue so professionally and open-mindedly. Most folks don't realize it, but by the time a hearing happens, its outcome is often a foregone conclusion. The real work of educating members and staff happens in the weeks and months leading up to the actual hearing. So, it was good they were as interested in understanding bitcoin's benefits as they were about its risks. It was also good that my colleague Andrea Castillo and I were close to publishing ""Bitcoin: A Primer for Policymakers"", a monograph we'd been working on after anticipating just this kind of educational need. In May, I attended the bitcoin 2013 conference in San Jose, which was a watershed moment for the ecosystem. It was an amazing gathering of people and the air was electric with possibilities. It started to become clear that bitcoin was what I was doing with my life. At the conference, I met Patrick Murck who was then general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation. I also met KT Sagona of Thomson Reuters.  Thomson Reuters was partnering with the International Center for Missing and Exploited Children to put on a major one-day conference in DC for technologists, policymakers and law enforcement to discuss the ""virtual economy"" (by which they meant bitcoin and Tor). They asked me and Patrick to participate. Knowing Patrick would be in town with Gavin Andresen (who at the time was the grown-up face of bitcoin), I introduced them to the Senate Homeland Security Committee staff who were looking to talk to more experts. After the conference, ICMEC/Thomson-Reuters created a task force of government, law enforcement, academics and policy experts to study the benefits and risks of digital currencies and online markets. Patrick and I were again asked to participate, and so was Jim Harper of the Cato Institute and Kelley Misata of the Tor Project. During the various task force meetings, Patrick, Jim, Kelley and I made a couple of simple but very important points over and over again: In July, Patrick and the Bitcoin Foundation organized a major briefing for law enforcement hosted by FinCEN, where same message was delivered. By the time the hearing came around, we had forged a consensus on the risks posed by bitcoin.  During the hearing, there was a government panel that included FinCEN, the Secret Service and the DoJ, and an experts panel that included me, Patrick, Ernie from ICMEC and Jeremy Allaire of Circle – a startup that had just been launched to much fanfare the previous month. The day came and, well, I can't put it better than The Washington Post did in its headline: ""This Senate hearing is a Bitcoin lovefest."" ""High-level international cybercriminals have not by-and-large gravitated to the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin,"" testified the Secret Service witness, Edward W Lowery. ""These virtual currencies are not in and of themselves illegal. There is good reason for us to remain watchful, but we also intend to balance that against the need for legitimate users,"" said the DoJ. And FinCEN’s Jennifer Shasky Calvery answered a question from Chairman Carper: ""Cash is probably still the best medium for laundering money."" And there were the first words in Ernie Allen's testimony: You can imagine what Patrick, Jeremy and I said.  The next day there was another hearing on bitcoin by the Senate Banking Committee. When they had heard that the Homeland Security Committee had scheduled a hearing, they had scurried to schedule one of their own to make sure they, too, were claiming jurisdiction. What was most interesting to me was what Senator Chuck Schumer had to say. Six months earlier, Schumer had written a letter to the Attorney General expressing concern about online drug markets and he'd told the press that bitcoin was ""an online form of money laundering used to disguise the source of money and to disguise who's both selling and buying the drug"". On the day of the hearing, he began his statement this way: Bitcoin had jumped a major hurdle. The message from official Washington was clear: bitcoin was not illegal or illegitimate, it was an important innovation – even if, like most new technologies, it presented challenges to law enforcement. The industry and ecosystem around bitcoin was serious and replete with businesses and individuals who could be counted on to help fend off illicit uses. It really couldn’t have gone better and, of course, the price of bitcoin jumped about 20% (although a couple of months later, Mt Gox imploded). At the time both of these hearings were scheduled, I knew we were at a major turning point, and government interest in bitcoin hasn't let up yet.  Senate hearing image via YouTube

                            Bitcoin Price Sets New Single Exchange All-Time High                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-sets-new-single-exchange-time-high/," The price of bitcoin reached the highest level observed at any time, on any exchange today, reaching $1,411 on British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex. However, far from a rallying cry for bitcoin enthusiasts, the bitcoin price has emerged as an outlier among those offered by its global peers. At this value, bitcoin on Bitfinex was trading more than $130 higher than it was on OKCoin, nearly $100 above its price on Kraken and roughly $90 higher than Coinbase's GDAX exchange. Notably, the cryptocurrency's price on Bitfinex was also trading more than $100 above the price of the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), an index from which it was recently suspended. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $1,299, just below its all-time high of $1,325. At the time of report, the cryptocurrency’s price had pared these gains somewhat, trading at roughly $1,410.00. But, as for what to make of the increase, traders have been less clear. On one hand, the cryptocurrency's price rallied in spite of the industry's ongoing scaling dilemma and continued banking challenges, while on the other, those very issues have stoked concerns across the ecosystem. When asked about the sentiment among traders, BTC VIX, organizer of bitcoin trading community Whale Club, said there are now concerns Bitfinex ""may never have access to USD clearing again"", and that this was creating a ""Bitfinex premium"" in the market. The result, he alleged, has been heightened bitcoin buying amid concerns that access to fiat funds at exchanges could decline. Indeed, spreads have widened as cryptocurrency exchanges – most notably Bitfinex – have struggled with ongoing banking challenges that are preventing customers from making formerly routine deposits and withdrawals. However, the exchange is not alone, as OKCoin and BTC-e have also recently reported issues with US dollar transfers. Earlier this month, Bitfinex announced that it was experiencing delays in its outbound wire transfers as a result of problems involving its Taiwan banks. Bitfinex cited the refusal of Wells Fargo, its correspondent bank-to process these transactions as causing the problem. Only days after revealing this challenge, the exchange announced that it was refusing incoming wires. At the time, the spread between Bitfinex bitcoin prices and prices on other exchanges widened, rising to more than $90 in some cases. Dangerous heights image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's Price is Nearing All-Time Highs, But Market Confidence Isn't                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-may-riding-high-market-confidence-isnt/," While the price of bitcoin is within striking distance of all-time highs set in March, worries about the state of the network's infrastructure are combining to depress sentiment. Chief among concerns are the ongoing issues at British Virgin Islands-based digital currency exchange Bitfinex, as the market's dominant US dollar exchange saw banking problems appear seemingly out of nowhere earlier this month. To recap, it was revealed just weeks ago that Bitfinex has been unable to process outbound wire transfers from the banks it works with in Taiwan. The issue, the exchange said, was that Wells Fargo, acting as a correspondent bank for those Taiwanese institutions, had refused to handle those transactions. However, the issues at hand go deeper than simply one exchange. Complicating matters is that some fear Bitfinex's problems could prove systemic due to its ties to other exchanges. Further, with bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals still barred at major exchanges in China following a crackdown by the country's central bank, it's difficult to determine just how much of the market is functional at the moment. Long-time bitcoin investor and blockchain startup founder Vinny Lingham went so far as to call the situation ""perplexing"", saying that he's unable to read the current situation. (And this statement comes from an investor nicknamed ""Bitcoin Oracle"" for his ability to predict price movements). Lingham told CoinDesk he fears that investors may be at risk due to the banking issues observed at Bitfinex, describing this as the ""reality of the situation"" given current information. Still, others went a step further. Nejc Kodric, CEO of digital currency exchange Bitstamp, called the situation ""similar to Mt Gox"", a reference to the now-defunct Japanese bitcoin exchange that collapsed in 2014, resulting in millions of dollars in customer losses. Kodric further stated that he doesn't believe the current price reflects ""organic growth"", while worrying that issues could compound, creating a serious issue for the market as a whole. ""There are three things that an exchange can have trouble with. The first is having a hack, the second thing is being shut down or warned, or anything around regulators, and the third is getting your accounts shut down,"" he said, adding: Other commentators have largely brushed off these concerns, expressing optimism that the exchange – which paid back customers after a $65m loss in a matter of months last year – has shown the capacity to weather blows. Already, the exchange is said to be looking for other banking options. Other market observers have discussed fears that a domino effect could play out should Bitfinex's banking issues prove prolonged, or worse, fatal to the health of the exchange. So far, it seems investors are taking precautions. An address identified as a Bitfinex cold wallet (where it keeps user funds away from live internet connections) shows customers are withdrawing bitcoin holdings in the account steadily.  A lesser-publicized development is that Tether, a startup offering a digital asset tied to the US dollar (and that shares a common ownership with Bitfinex) has seen its offering lose its dollar peg. In short, the technology behind tether aims to tie cryptographic keys with real-world value, ensuring $1 is always worth one 'USDT'. At press time, however, Tether has been trading below the $1-mark for over a week. It's currently trading at $0.91, according to data from CoinMarketCap. But while the idea for a ""stable cryptocurrency"" or one pegged to fiat money isn’t new, research from the Cato Institute shows past attempts have largely failed, with projects such as CoinoUSD and NuBits experiencing notable issues. Tether, however, has perhaps reached a scale beyond these projects, serving as one of the primary trading vehicles for Poloniex, a cryptocurrency-only exchange. (Poloniex has traded $5m in USDT over the last 24 hours, and has used the token since 2015 as a way to offer an alternative to fiat funding). Shawn Wilkinson, CEO of Storj, a startup from the early crypto 2.0 scene that would spawn Tether and other early blockchain applications, lamented that the idea itself is perhaps flawed. ""Basically it only takes one bank account frozen or some cash being seized and suddenly fractional reserve,"" Wilkinson said. ""And in crypto that's almost a 100% certainty."" The more extreme doomsday theory goes something like this: Should USDT fail because of issues at Bitfinex, this could in turn impact Poloniex, thereby increasing the total market damage given that Poloniex is a leading exchange for both new and existing cryptocurrency listings. Representatives from Tether declined to comment when reached, though the project's co-founder and former CEO, Reeve Collins, said he was optimistic about that the issues would be short-lived. (Collins is no longer involved in Tether and is working on his own blockchain stealth startup). ""I'm sure they will pull through. The utility of that coin is too great to not overcome the bumps in the road,"" Collins said. For now, however, active traders appear to be migrating to over-the-counter buy and sell options due to issues at major exchanges. What's more, overall exchange volume appears to have declined since the year began, according to available market data. Bobby Cho, a trader at OTC firm Cumberland Mining, reported an increase in transactions and overall interest in its offering in recent weeks. ""Since the announcement from Bitfinex and Tether about intermediary banking difficulties, we have seen firsthand that bitcoin trading volume is moving away from Bitfinex and Tether towards over-the-counter trading,"" he told CoinDesk. Zhao Dong, a private OTC trader based in China, noted that participants in that market – long one of the more dominant for digital currency trading – share similar concerns. ""Weird market now,"" he remarked. ""Chinese exchanges can't withdraw bitcoin, the biggest exchange Bitfinex can't withdraw US dollars."" Still, he said any change in the market brings opportunities for savvy investors, and that well-connected network users are still easily able to ""cash out"" through the range of available global exchanges. Yet for all the new drama, legal sources in the industry say these latest issues are part of a very old problem. The tension between the banking industry and the nascent bitcoin startup space isn't exactly new, though it tends to rear its head periodically. Nor is Bitfinex the first exchange service to have problems with Wells Fargo, as CoinDesk reported back in 2014. Back then, it had become increasingly clear that major banks weren't willing to accept the perceived risks. As a result, some institutions moved to close accounts held by bitcoin startups. But the banks aren't just targeting bitcoin companies – financial institutions worldwide have been shuttering accounts held by companies that offer money services in a bid to trim the risk of potential laundering. According to Carol Van Cleef, financial technology lead for law firm BakerHostetler, correspondent banks like Wells Fargo have been scrutinizing not only their customers, but also their customers' customers in recent years. It's this state of affairs, she suggested, that may have ensnared Bitfinex. But it's unclear at this time what drove Wells Fargo to take the action it did – the bank has, to date, declined comment on the matter – or if it simply arose from the confusion banks have experienced in an era of growing regulation. When it comes to policing activity, Van Cleef said simply: Stan Higgins contributed reporting. Tiger image via Shutterstock

                            Overstock Caps Series A for Bitcoin Startup Ripio With $400k Funding                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/overstock-caps-series-bitcoin-startup-ripio-400k-funding/,"Ripio, the bitcoin startup formerly known as Bitpagos, has officially closed its Series A funding round with a $428,000 investment from Overstock subsidiary Medici Ventures. As revealed exclusively to CoinDesk, the Series A – led by China-based VC fund Huiyin Blockchain Venture – brought in a final total of $2.25m and is intended to fund the newly rebranded firm's plans for international expansion. Further, the Medici investment marks a change to Ripio's original funding plans, which had been to close the Series A with smaller investors via the AngelVest platform. In interview, Ripio senior vice president David Garcia said that, in addition to launching new features on its platform, his firm is seeking to expand to Mexico and Colombia in coming months. Garcia said: The Argentina-based firm, which now employs 25 people, has already expanded into Brazil and aims to establish itself in the new markets as early as the end of this quarter. The startup – which provides bitcoin exchange, payments and credit services – now claims 70,000 users, an increase of 10,000 since January. Medici president and Overstock chairman Jonathan Johnson told CoinDesk that, when he heard of the opportunity to join the round, he was first attracted to the combination of the startup's peer-to-merchant services and its advances in cross-border remittance services. However, it was the firm's location in Latin America that sealed the deal, he said. An estimated 70% (about 400 million) of people in the region either do not have a bank account or are counted among the 'underbanked', meaning their access to financial services is not sufficient for basic requirements. ""In the payments space,"" Johnson said, ""it feels like blockchain is very well positioned for the unbanked, which the current technology and systems are not."" The Ripio funding, he continued, represents a deeper expansion of Medici's portfolio into the potentially valuable remittance use case, with the company already having invested in Peernova, Bitt, SettleMint, Factom and IdentityMind. As part of the new investment, Johnson added, Medici is expected to take an ""observer"" seat on Ripio’s board of directors – a position he distinguished from more formal voting board members. While the individual who takse up the role has yet to be determined, Johnson said ""it's likely to be a technologist"" with the expertise to help Ripio make business-critical decisions. Garcia commented: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ripio. Concrete worker image via Shutterstock

                            Purse Launches Testnet for Bitcoin Scaling Tech 'Extension Blocks'                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/purse-launches-extension-block-testnet-bitpay-help-evaluate/,"A new element was added to the bitcoin scaling debate this week when the developer team behind startup Purse announced the launch of a testnet to trial its scaling solution, extension blocks. Purse had already presented the ideas behind extension blocks in a blog post earlier this month, but the testnet will allow users to interact with working code for the new technology, available through GitHub. So far, the launch seems to have galvanized early supporters, drawn to the way that the proposal would separate the block size from the network's consensus rules, essentially allowing peers to set their own version of the limit. BitPay CEO Stephen Pair, for example, announced that his company would be participating in the technical evaluation of the testnet, and gave his backing to future implementation of the idea, contingent on testing. ""If it holds up to scrutiny, we may support activation on the mainnet,"" Pair wrote in a Medium post. For those who haven't been following, proponents of extension blocks see it as a way to scale network capacity that will appeal to various factions in the current debate, thereby building consensus among developers and mining pools that have previously been at odds. However, support for extension blocks is not universal. In a post to the bitcoin-dev mailing list discussing the Purse team's initial extension block specification, Core developer Luke Dashjr assessed that the proposal as one that would ""creat[e] a lot of additional technical debt"". Johnson Lau, author of an earlier extension block proposal in January, also warned of possible security risks: ""Logically speaking if SegWit is not safe, this BIP could only be worse,"" Lau wrote in an email to the bitcoin-dev list.

As previously reported by CoinDesk, the SEC shot down a bid by the Winklevoss brothers to get the ETF listed on the Bats BZX exchange in March. Specifically, the agency declined a rule change proposed by Bats that would have cleared the path for the ETF, citing a lack of market surveillance and regulation. Less than two weeks after the decision was handed down, Bats petitioned for a review – a move that the agency has now greenlit. The SEC said yesterday that it had approved the review, opening the door to further comment between now and 15th May. The agency said: The news comes weeks after the SEC rejected another bitcoin-tied ETF, proposed by SolidX, that would have listed on the NYSE Arca exchange if approved. At the time, the price of bitcoin set new all-time highs – even passing the price of gold – amid speculation about the investment vehicle. The decision further flies in the face of popular commentary, as analysts polled by CoinDesk initially saw an uphill road for an attempts to reinstate the proposal.

                            UASF Developer Revises Controversial Bitcoin Scaling Proposal                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/lets-try-this-again-uasf-developer-puts-forth-new-proposal/,"A controversial proposal for upgrading the bitcoin blockchain saw a notable strategy shift this weekend. Since its publication on the bitcoin-dev mailing list on 25th February, a proposal by pseudonymous contributor Shaolinfry for a user-activated soft fork (UASF) has been widely discussed – and framed by some as a possible way around the current deadlock over SegWit activation. Conversation has so far centered on how the need for a supermajority consensus in network decision-making means that any mining pool with enough hashing power holds effective veto power over any proposal, a fact many believe is responsible for delays in SegWit adoption. The logic of a UASF, by contrast, is to bypass this veto power and put signaling into the hands of the digital currency's user base as a whole. After the first general proposal for a UASF, Shaolinfry put forward a second proposal, BIP148, focused on putting the onus of supporting SegWit onto the 'economic majority', moving power out of the miners' hands. Yet, even after it gained momentum, high-profile voices such as Bitcoin Core developer Gregory Maxwell and other bitcoin developers rejected the proposal on the basis it could undermine the stability of the bitcoin ecosystem. ""We should use the least disruptive mechanisms available and the BIP148 proposal does not meet that test,"" Maxwell wrote. It's against this backdrop that Shaolinfry has announced work on a redraft of the proposal, which is aimed to address some of the concerns voiced by Maxwell and others in the community. Shaolinfry conceded at the beginning of an announcement post that the reason for the changes is related to technical criticisms of how the plan would upgrade the network. Shaolinfry wrote: The revised proposal, allocated the identifier BIP8, is an addition to BIP9, a proposal that concerns how soft forks are implemented. The changes also hint at what could happen should bitcoin's scaling debate continue over the course of 2017. Currently, if the 95% hashrate support for SegWit is not reached by the end of a certain time window (15th November), the proposal is set to be discarded by default. However, technical changes made in a proposal under the terms of BIP8 would be automatically locked in at the end of the time period, although they could also be adopted sooner. Shaolinfry's suggestion is that after the 15th November cut off date, a UASF SegWit proposal be made under the terms of BIP8. This would mean that the community would have a full year from the present date to prepare for upgrading by means of a UASF, removing the possible destabilizing effect of a short-term. The developer argued in the post: So far, there has been less of a response from the community on the terms of BIP8, but the idea of an automatic lock-in could be contentious. However, with the community stalled over SegWit (and litecoin moving forward on its upgrade), the suggestion of an unambiguous adoption procedure will doubtless seem appealing for many observers.

                            New Bitcoin Core Software Makes SegWit Optional for Miners                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/new-bitcoin-core-software-makes-segwit-optional-miners/,"A new software update has been published by the Bitcoin Core open-source development community. Released on Saturday, version 0.14.1 largely builds on the group's March 0.14.0 release, incorporating a series of fixes to bugs and other tweaks to the code. Bitcoin Core is the standard software for bitcoin, though it has faced new pressure from alternative implementations of late. As such, one notable inclusion in the release focuses on Segregated Witness, the scaling upgrade debuted in late 2015 at the Scaling Bitcoin conference in Hong Kong, and that has provoked a now months-long debate over network development. The update to 'getblocktemplate', or the mining protocol that underlies the bitcoin network, effectively enables those operating hardware needed to secure the blockchain to upgrade to 0.14.1 without having to explicitly opt in to SegWit. As Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan wrote in a release statement, the change enables miners who aren't running SegWit-compatible software to keep operating normally if the upgrade is adopted network-wide. Van der Laan went on to explain: The release also comes at a time when the litecoin network, the fourth-largest cryptocurrency by volume, is on the verge of implementing the SegWit code upgrade.

                            The UN Wants to Adopt Bitcoin And Ethereum âÂ And Soon                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/the-united-nations-wants-to-accept-ethereum-and-bitcoin-and-soon/,"The United Nations (UN) is in the final stages ofÂ what could be one of the most epic blockchainÂ projects of all time. After successfully using the ethereum blockchain to transmit Pakistani rupees to 100 people earlier this year, the UN's World Food Program (WFP) is arranging extra security to ensure it safely executes the next stage of itsÂ work. A pilot test, scheduled to begin in Jordan on 1st May, will see the WFP sending an unspecified number of dinars to more than 10,000 recipients in need of financial support and extra food, with the goal of expanding the number of recipients to 500,000 people byÂ 2018. To protect the privacy of the recipients, the exact amount to be disbursed is not being revealed. But the technology being developed is part of an even bigger push to make the UN's services so resilient that they could survive even the destruction of the UN itself. The secret to such a design, according to WFP financial officer Houman Haddad, could be to remove the dinarÂ altogether as a means of distributing funds â along with any other state-issued currency. ""At the moment we're paying out in normal currencies, so-called fiat currencies,"" said Haddad, who also works with both the WFP's treasury and financial risk management divisions. ""That is mainly because a lot of the places in which we work don't accept either bitcoin or ether."" He told CoinDesk: Called 'Building Blocks', the first successful test of the ethereum-based solution was conducted in January in the Sindh province of Pakistan. There, 100 people received 3,000 rupees and the equivalent value in food via transactions authenticated on the ethereum testnet. Created over a 40-day period, the proof-of-concept is the latest effort designed to show that a blockchain could be used to distribute humanitarian aid to those in need. Beneficiaries of the project were assigned random one-time passwords that displayed on their mobile devices, which were then shown to supermarket proprietors who helped disperse both the funds and food. At the end of the test, the transaction records on the public ethereum testnet were reconciled with the actual funds distributed. The procedure flips on its head the idea of cutting out the middleman. Instead of paying the funds directly to the recipients, the UN sends the money to the shops, cutting out both banks and even the actual recipients. In one example cited by Haddad, money meant for 100,000 beneficiaries could instead be paid directly to the 400 merchants that might be available in that area. ""The cost will be lower because there will be fewer transactions, no admin fees and all of that,"" said Haddad. ""The risk will be lower because we don't have to advance money to anyone because we would only pay for actual purchases."" A second pilot planned for August will see the test expand beyond the borders of Jordan to other nations, with the possibility of reaching tens of millions of recipients served by the WFP in the future. Yet, both the proof-of-concept and upcoming pilot are part of a larger push within the UN to rethink what the organization calls cash-based transfers (CBT). Instead of turning over perishable resources such as food and medicine, the UNÂ directly injects money into the local economy in the form of vouchers, prepaid cards, mobile moneyÂ and more. In 2015, the program transferred $680m in aid to recipients, a number Haddad said the WFP hopes to increase to $2bn per year. In the first six years of the program, 9.6 million people were given assistance through cash-based transfers. Though the advantages of CBT include increased efficiency and stimulated trade, there's still plenty room to improve, according to Haddad.  Specifically, he believes the current system still suffers from fees, a lack of privacy for the recipient, risks associated with relying on startup mobile money companies and lengthy contracting processes to ensure payment is still completed in the case these startups fail. All of these issues, Haddad said, could be reduced by moving the transactions to a blockchain. As such, the pilot is set to continue over the course of May, and will be conducted on a private version of the ethereum blockchain, with the goal of eventually conducting 1 million transactions per month. ""If we reach the $2bn mark that we are set to achieve in terms of total spending on cash-based transfer,"" he said, ""we estimate conservatively we could save $20m a year."" While consortia models have become increasingly popular for financial institutions looking to leverage the network effect of blockchain, the WFPÂ went in a decidedly different direction. Developed in partnership with the Field Innovation Exchange offered by exponential technology think tank, Singularity University, the pilot is designed as the next step towards increasing internal cooperation between agencies at the UN.  Initially, the project, developed at WFP's Innovation Accelerator, is being built to give store keepers a reliable way to know how much money and food each of their customers can afford. But project manager Alexandra Alden said she'd eventually like to see applications open up in divisions across the UN,Â with efforts aimed atÂ cryptographically securing identity, tracking supply chain logistics and leveraging Internet of Things-enabled devices. Importantly, Alden and Haddad hope that future incarnations of the technology could be built on the public ethereum blockchain, should it grow to be able to handle the necessary transaction volumes. ""The ideal world would be where beneficiaries have smartphones,"" said Alden. ""They can store their own private key so they can see the transaction history, their entitlements, where the shops are that are selling the goods they want, price analysis of where rice is cheaper."" To help ensure that the WFP is working closely with government agencies, she added: Haddad breaks down the benefits of blockchain into three categories: empowering beneficiaries, lowering costs and reducing redundancy in the system of UN services. Unlike previous attempts to collaborate that he said were stunted by internal competitive interests, he believes the blockchain solutions being developed across the UN will someday be able to interoperate because of the common source of data. Already, UN Women has partnered with Innovation Norway to make it easier for women and girls to explore blockchain, and it is currently hiring a blockchain consultant. In October, the UNÂ publicized its interest in using blockchain for sustainability projects, and in November, the United Nations Children's Fund invested in its first startup working in the sector. Should the United Nations ever integrate these blockchain efforts and more, Haddad said the potential benefits of reducing a number of redundancies will be limited unless the organization also starts accepting ethereum and other cryptocurrencies as a form of payment from donors. ""A lot of our people have offered to donate ether,"" he said. ""We canât accept it at the moment, but being in finance and treasury I'm actually looking at how we can start accepting it."" Haddad concluded: Image via the United Nations

                            How Cashaa Exploits Bitcoin Price Differentials for Remittances                        ",Sid Kalla,https://www.coindesk.com/cashaa-exploits-bitcoin-price-differentials-remittances/," Can bitcoin still provide a truly cheap money-sending service? While the idea might be out of favor in some circles, London startup Cashaa is now using bitcoin price differentials – the same feature long used as evidence for why it wouldn't work as a currency – to deliver a novel payments product. Founded in 2016, the service works by connecting traditional remittance participants with two traders, each of whom are able to execute bitcoin-fiat trades in each local currency. Due to price arbitrage opportunities that exist in the global crypto markets, the traders using Cashaa are able to make a profit while filling Cashaa's order book. The system works because bitcoin prices tend to be higher in markets that are receivers of remittances, and because of the availability of digital currency exchanges in a range of markets. As explained by Kumar Gaurav, the CEO of Cashaa, there is an ongoing price differential between the UK bitcoin market and the Indian and Nigerian bitcoin markets where Cashaa currently operates. ""We consistently see a 3–4% spread between UK and India, and 8–11% spread between UK and Nigeria,"" he said in interview. Gaurav told CoinDesk: While limited in jurisdiction today, Gaurav believes the service can be deployed between any two markets where a bitcoin arbitrage opportunity exists. Behind the scenes, Cashaa is split into two systems. One is the traditional remittance service. Here, the remittance user sees the market exchange rate between local fiat and receiver's fiat. There are no fees to send the money (Cashaa charges £1 in order to guarantee execution at a fixed exchange rate, otherwise, the rate is floating based on the market price). The sender can pay either via cash or bank account, and the receiver can accept money either via cash or bank account. ""The end consumer seeking to send money home doesn’t even need to know what bitcoin is,"" Gaurav explained. The second system (working behind the scenes) breaks up the remittance order into two trades against bitcoin. Each of these is put into an order book that can be picked up by the traders. The first leg is converting between sender's fiat into bitcoin, and the second leg is converting between bitcoin and receiver's fiat. Each of these traders can make a profit by filling these orders, since the bitcoin price in receiver's fiat is higher than the bitcoin price in sender's fiat. Traders must put 10% into escrow, which is forfeited if they accept an order and don’t fulfill it. This helps guard against bitcoin price volatility and order cancellation. Of course, a number of companies are tackling the remittance market using bitcoin, but there are a few features that stand out with Cashaa. One is the ability for Cashaa to process cash payments by the sender. This makes up a bulk of the low amount remittance market currently held by companies like Western Union. Further, Cashaa is able to process the whole payment chain without the sender or receiver ever having to interact with bitcoin, which means they are able to truly use bitcoin in the background, Gaurav said. Cashaa is currently working to sign up remittance agents to the service, firms that today use existing players like Western Union to transfer money. In this model, the savers will still go to the same agent, but the agent, instead of using Western Union, would use Cashaa to save money on fees. The savings are then split between the consumer and the agent. ""The agent, the receiver, and Cashaa all make a profit,"" Gaurav said, concluding: Historical globe image via Shutterstock

                            That Time We Gave $500,000 in Bitcoin to College Kids...                        ",Dan Elitzer & Jeremy Rubin,https://www.coindesk.com/time-we-gave-500000-bitcoin-college-kids/,"Dan Elitzer is the blockchain and digital identity lead at IDEO CoLab (a collaborative R&D network) and the founder of the MIT Bitcoin Club; Jeremy Rubin is a Bitcoin Core developer and the co-founder of the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, the school's in-house research effort aimed at the technology.
 In this ""Bitcoin Milestones"" entry, Elitzer and Rubin recall their efforts as MIT students to boost bitcoin, using a mock interview with CoinDesk to tell the story of how they once distributed $500,000 in BTC to MIT's entire undergraduate population.  CoinDesk: Where did the idea for the MIT Bitcoin Project come from? Jeremy: I started following bitcoin in late 2011. My sophomore fall, I did a hackathon project called Tidbit with some friends. Tidbit aimed to use browser-based bitcoin mining to replace online ad monetization, but that's a different story. About six weeks into the spring term, laying in bed one night, I was brainstorming project ideas for a class. I wanted to study the social implications of bitcoin. It just kind of came to me all at once: ""I should give $100 in bitcoin to every computer science student at MIT and see what happens."" I started shooting off exploratory emails immediately, and I sent one to Dan. Dan: I got into bitcoin in the summer of 2013, right before starting at MIT Sloan. I thought bitcoin had potential to boost financial inclusion in the developing world. When I read Jeremy's email, I'd just started the MIT Bitcoin Club, where I had put on a couple events. After a few exchanges, I decided I was all-in to make this happen. I pushed us early on to go bigger and give bitcoin to all the undergrads, not just CS students, because I thought it would make for a more compelling experiment. CoinDesk: What was the bitcoin scene like when you started the project? Dan: In 2014, bitcoin wasn't seen as legitimate yet, even at MIT. Most considered it at best a fad, at worst a Ponzi scheme. My classmates thought I was nuts for starting the Bitcoin Club. One problem was that there wasn't any traditional community in the world where bitcoin was used and understood. Initiating network effects is really hard. Our goal was to create the first such community at the world's premier technical university. If there was anywhere bitcoin could take off, it was at MIT. Jeremy: When we started the project, campus involvement with bitcoin was pretty minimal. A number of students knew about it and could half-explain it, but there weren't very many projects happening. Dan: The Bitcoin Club's first event was a talk by Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire. We closed the doors 10 minutes before the talk was scheduled to start because people had already filled all 200 seats, not including the stairs and the floor. The free dinner was long gone well before the event, so we knew students weren't just there for a free meal.  Jeremy: Before we launched the project, for a class project, I sent out a bitcoin survey. The survey showed mixed awareness among students, with some purporting to be bitcoin experts and others knowing nothing at all about the cryptocurrency. It also showed that my peers were optimistic about the potential of the tech and wanted to learn more. I was jazzed. Dan: From then on, we saw the MIT Bitcoin Project as an opportunity to catalyze this excitement and jumpstart the creation of a campus ecosystem of both users and developers. We also figured it would be a good headline for bitcoin. Like, 'Hey, if those MIT kids are using it, maybe it really is the future!' CoinDesk: Were there any major obstacles you faced while doing the project? Jeremy: I was super worried at the onset of the project about potential controversy. While I was figuring out how to give students bitcoin, I was in the middle of a protracted fight with the State of New Jersey over Tidbit. It would have been awful if a student experimenting with the technology because of the MIT Bitcoin Project found themselves in similar hot water. Dan: That's why we did the project as an IRB-approved research study, rather than just an activity of the Bitcoin Club. If something went wrong, at least it was MIT-approved. We were fine with that, because we certainly didn’t want to hand out half a million bucks to a bunch of students and not learn anything. Jeremy: Even though funding was so critical to the project, it was probably the least challenging part. The intersection of MIT alumni and bitcoin enthusiasts were incredibly generous with their financial contributions, especially Alex Morcos, who contributed the most substantially. CoinDesk: What was your experience like on the big day? Dan: The coin drop was the main event. We knew it would get attention, but I don't think we realized quite how much. The level of excitement was unreal. We'd announced the first MIT Bitcoin Expo a week before we announced the coin drop. The announcement drove attendance to around 400 people. The whole event came together in just over a month and we couldn't have done it without last minute support from HackMIT and the Society of Women Engineers. The Expo was probably the most technical bitcoin conference to have ever occurred. One of MIT's largest and most historic lecture halls, 26-100, was packed with students and bitcoiners. I remember the Armory guys had a bitcoin-script puzzle, and the future MIT Bitcoin Club president solved it first. Jeremy: My fraternity brother, Richard Ni, helped us coordinate a summer-long lecture series and hackathon called BitComp after that. It was like a mini-incubator. BitComp brought nascent bitcoin startups to MIT (like Chain, Coinbase, Circle, Kraken and Blockchain) to advise participants. An early form of Enigma was one of the winning projects. CoinDesk: What was your relationship like with the MIT admins? Dan: They couldn’t have been more supportive of the project. We involved them early on. They were careful to make clear that MIT was not endorsing bitcoin directly, but made it equally clear that our student-driven initiative with emerging technology, entrepreneurship and experimentation was MIT's bread and butter. Jeremy: That's how I roped in Joi Ito, director of the MIT Media Lab, to ensure that the project would push the envelope, but not so far as to cause a problem for the administration. Dan: We also worked with two of my professors from MIT Sloan. Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker were invaluable collaborators in formalizing our experiment as an IRB-approved study. This ensured the project had a shot at producing high-quality findings, that have been turned into multiple published papers. CoinDesk: What did the actual distribution of the bitcoin feel like? Dan: Super exhausting – but exhilarating too. Jeremy: Definitely nerve-wracking for me. During the sign-up phase, I had to run a database migration to correct a small non-critical bug. It should have been a quick fix, but due to lack of sleep, I managed to mess it up. I had to restore from the back-up database. It ended up taking me four hours or so to correct things. Dan: Our sign-up was so complicated because we were doing a number of randomized experiments. Students could sign up and provide an address to receive their bitcoin into any wallet of their choice, optionally encrypting the address they sent us. This meant that a lot of work had to go into making sure they had properly set up their wallet and were not going to lose funds. We also sent the bitcoin out in waves over a span of multiple weeks which layered in more complexity. Jeremy: The actual distribution of the coins, once we had completed sign-up, was really smooth, though. CoinDesk: How did students react initially? Jeremy: At first, a lot of people had no clue they'd received the coins. In the following few days, I got a lot of thank yous in the Infinite, MITs main corridor, and heard a few non-repeatable stories. Dan: We also saw some interesting behavior with peer interaction during the distribution. Certain dorms held office hours on how to use bitcoin. Some enterprising students offered to fill out the survey on behalf of others for a cut of their coins. CoinDesk: What were the results of the experiment? Was there anything that surprised you in particular? Dan: We expected to see more traction on retail and peer-to-peer payments during the experiment. We ended up seeing limited use of bitcoin for both, despite a handful of local merchants accepting the cryptocurrency. Jeremy: I bought a mango smoothie from a 'bitcoin-ready' burrito joint, but the cashier was confused on how to do it correctly. Despite my protests, they undercharged me.  Dan: I purchased a hat at the Coop, MIT and Harvard’s student store. Not only did it take them five minutes to track down the only iPad in the store set up to take bitcoin, but I had to leave the store to send the transaction because my phone wasn't getting any signal at the register. Jeremy: Our experience wasn't common though – many students just held onto their coins! I think that retail usability hasn’t improved much since, so we'll see what the coming years bring. CoinDesk: What's the lasting legacy of the project? Dan: Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker published multiple papers on how a nascent network platform can flourish (or languish) depending on how early adopters are segmented, and the ways in which users of the system who claim to value privacy are susceptible to relatively small incentives and tweaks in messaging. Jeremy: I'm most proud of how well the community at MIT is doing, especially the DCI, the MIT Digital Currency Initiative – currently led by Neha Narula – which was founded as an outgrowth of the MIT Bitcoin Project. Dan: The MIT Bitcoin Club is still very active, having just hosted the fourth annual MIT Bitcoin Expo. I'm really pleased to see the community at MIT in such a strong position. Jeremy: What's most amazing to both of us is that, through the last three years, we have both still been so captivated by bitcoin. And to see our captivation with bitcoin shared across MIT a year after we've both graduated is really cool!  Images via Dan Elitzer, Jeremy Rubin and Christopher A Maynor

                            Hedge Fund Billionaire Invests 10% Net Worth into Bitcoin and Ether                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/hedge-fund-founder-invests-10-net-worth-bitcoin-ether/,"A former principal at Fortress Investment Group claims to have invested 10% of his overall net worth into cryptocurrencies. Speaking at a Harvard Business School forum on Wednesday, Michael Novogratz discussed his outlook on blockchain and digital currencies, according to a report by CNN Money. Participating on panel that included representatives from Microsoft and CME Group, Novogratz said he has invested in both bitcoin and ether, the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum blockchain, calling the moves the ""best investment"" of his life, the report said. CNN further detailed how Novogratz said he invested in ether when it was trading for just $1, having been impressed by ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin at a dinner party held at his home. According to CoinDesk's Ether Price Index, the cryptocurrency was trading at around $48 at the time of publication. While such outsized statements may seem unusual from a financial industry veteran, Fortress Investment Group was actually one of the earliest firms to show an interest in the sector, investing into a $150m hedge fund called Pantera Capital in 2014. Novogratz was notably involved in the early formation of the group, according to reports at the time, serving as co-chief investment officer of Pantera Bitcoin Partners, the fund managed by Pantera Capital. He would later step down from his position as CIO of the Fortress Macro Fund, which represented roughly 3% of the firm's total assets under management, at the time it was closed. Correction: An earlier version of this article mistakenly referred to Novogratz as the founder of Fortress. This has been revised. Novogratz image via YouTube

                            Bitcoin's Unlimited Potential Lies in Its Apolitical Core                        ",Nozomi Hayase,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-unlimited-potential-lies-in-apolitical-core/," The ongoing bitcoin block size debate has accelerated into a civil war. From threats of a 51% attack to online trolls to controversy over the allegations surrounding AsicBoost, disagreements on scaling solutions have created a toxic environment, and as a result, the ecosystem growing around bitcoin has started to echo the craziness of party politics. In these times, we must remember, we have witnessed a failure of national politics. From the 2008 financial meltdown to vicious cycles of austerity, unprecedented levels of corruption have spawned a global crisis of legitimacy of institutions and governments. And this only seems to have gotten worse. In the US, at the center of financial and political power, the populace has been trapped by a corporate sponsored political charade, with a rigged presidential primary and the election of what many felt was the lesser of two evils. More and more, people are beginning to wake up to the broken promises and failed policies of their leaders, creating conflicts and instability in regions around the world. Media echo chamber lies of ""weapons of mass destruction"" that led to the Iraq War are now being repeated with the recent US cruise-missile strike on Syria. Meanwhile, the global economy stagnates with skyrocketing unemployment and debts that are piling up. While solutions provided in the electoral arena have repeatedly shown to be ineffective, bitcoin presents an alternative – a departure from this system of politics. So what is politics? What are the characteristics of governance designed by it? The Oxford Dictionary defines politics as ""activities associated with the governance of a country or area, especially the debate between parties having power."" Politics is inherently associated with power and is a means to organize society through leaders gaining control over the majority. Western liberal democracy is politically engineered governance. Its fundamental feature is centralization. Rules made from the top are enforced, and changes in the system require permission from those who are in positions of authority. Historian Howard Zinn (1970) noted: This command-control style of governance works in hierarchies and is antithetical to democratic values. The integrity of the system depends on the success of rulers to foster obedience of those in the network and prevent people from dissenting. For this, managing perception and public opinion through mass media becomes necessary and the system operates under the appearance of democracy, making force of control covert and invisible. In ""Democracy INC: The Press and Law in the Corporate Rationalization of the Public Sphere"", professor of journalism David S. Allen (2005) described the role of professionals in facilitating this managed democracy. He noted how the creation of expert knowledge is essential in this machination. Science has become a methodology to back professional legitimacy, as ""individuals began to regard professional judgments, often supported by scientific data as unquestionable."" Professionals with expert knowledge perform the role of trusted third parties who are supposed to represent the interests of citizens and make decisions on their behalf. Here, the knowledge produced in social science, such as economics, political science and psychology are often used to maintain the status quo of power structures. From Alan Greenspan to Ben Bernanke and now Janet Yellen, economists who are appointed by the US President as chair of the Federal Reserve get to decide monetary policy for the country and exercise influence through central banks around the world. What validates their expert knowledge is an epistemological foundation called the ""creed of objectivity"". Social science has incorporated empirical and positivist methodology of natural science and claimed the ability to form knowledge in a similar way as physical science. With this, researchers assert neutrality as if he or she transcends race, class or any personal bias. Yet, they are embedded within cultural values and their purported value-free objectivity is not actually possible. One’s subjective agendas and personal views do not magically disappear by simply claiming it to be so. Without transparency that ensures disclosure of researchers' bias, this creed of objectivity becomes a cloak that hides their motivations, closing off any feedback and ensuring assertions that are not tested are promoted as universally applicable truth. Money in this representative democracy becomes political money, legitimatised by state authority and tied to monetary policies of investment banks and corporations that run government behind the scenes. A small number of powerful and rich can enact the ideology of neoliberalism and hijack a whole economy. Under the banner of 'free market', they justify their plunder as a crusade for progress. Now, a breakthrough of computer science has found a way to crack this closed logic of control. Bitcoin opens a path for changing the world without taking power. The white paper published under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto put forward a vision of a ""peer-to-peer version of electronic cash"", based on cryptographic proof, rather than relying on a trusted third party. The underpinnings of this innovation was the science of asymmetrical security that provides a strong armory against violence, exploitation and extreme selfishness through a mechanism of consensus. Richard Feynman, a theoretical physicist once said that scientific integrity is learning to not fool ourselves. He noted: ""The first principle is that you must not fool yourself – and you are the easiest person to fool."" In natural science, researchers are given honest feedback from the real world and nature through observation, repeated testing and experiments. On the other hand, social scientists explore dimensions more divorced from physical reality, and in their claim of neutrality, they can become blind to their own bias. This creed of objectivity in social science has shown itself to be vulnerable to tendencies toward deception, while math is a property that is impervious to manipulation. Math cannot be fooled, as it does not respond to lies and threats. Computer science relies on solid data, rigorous testing and peer-review. This gives each person an opportunity to engage in honest work to overcome self-deception and build strong security, even as strong as the laws in the physical world. In the existing model of governance, inherent weakness in the creed of objectivity made the system vulnerable to the tyranny of the few. Economic incentives set up by a professional class made the right to free speech exclusive for the beneficiaries of this managed democracy, suppressing any views that challenge this authority. Those privileged in the system call these perspectives subjective, relegating them to mere opinion. This doctrine of false objectivity that has been predominant in academia has conditioned researchers to remain impartial. This turned the populace into passive observers, preventing them from fully connecting with their passions and values. In the foundation of bitcoin development, there lies a particular philosophy that revolts against this restriction of free speech imposed by central authority. In the paper ""The Moral Character of Cryptographic Work"" published in 2015, eminent computer scientist, Phillip Rogaway brought forward the moral obligation of cryptographers and their importance, especially in the post-Snowden era. In this, he described a group that emerged in the late 1980s who saw the potential of cryptography in shifting power relations between the individual and the state. These are the cypherpunks who held a belief that ""cryptography can be a key tool for protecting individual autonomy threatened by power"". In an interview with Trace Mayer, applied cryptographer and inventor of Hashcash, Adam Back, talked about the ""positive social implications arising from cryptography"". He described the ethos of cypherpunks as writing code to bring the rights we enjoy offline into the online world. The idea is that lobbying politicians and promoting issues through the press would be a slow uphill battle. So, instead of engaging in legal and political systems, Back noted that they could simply ""deploy technology and help people do what they consider to be their legal right"" and society would later adjust itself to reflect these values. The cypherpunks, with their adamant claim of subjective domains, apply real objective knowledge that comes from math to bring change. As the forced network effect of petrodollar hegemony begins to loosen, the empire fuels aggression with more wars and sanctions. While this system of representation weakens, the logic of control from the old world is beginning to infiltrate the bitcoin ecosystem. Regulators try to reach cryptocurrency through exchanges and by enforcing know-your-customer rules, creating a fertile soil for government surveillance and privacy erosion. Centralization creeps in through industrial mining and patents on hardware, creating a trend toward state and corporate backed monopolies. All the while, the established media keep writing obituaries on bitcoin, wishing to declare the death of this new money they can't understand. Politics that spread through the crypto-community have been hijacking discussions on technical development. With PR, name-calling and smear campaigns, people engage in social engineering, distracting developers who are engineering security. This drama that some perceive as bitcoin's existential threat brings a crisis, yet at the same time is giving us all an opportunity to solidify our commitment to this technology’s fundamentals. Bitcoin as a premise of stateless money has brought many people together. These are free market enthusiasts, traders, libertarians, engineers, venture capitalists, anarchists and artists. Bitcoin is a disruptive technology that has large political implications. Yet, for it to manifest its true potential, we must not forget its roots in its apolitical nature – solid science. This apolitical nature is not a bug, but a feature. This is what makes bitcoin stateless money, censorship resistant, unseizable and permissionless. Our commitment to decentralization keeps this consensus algorithm running across the global network and allows all to participate in this scientific endeavor of proof-of-work – to show the world that the ideas of equality, fraternity and freedom are not just ideals  but universal truths. So, let us call a ceasefire in this political battle and engage in the honest, collaborative work of writing code. By moving from a system of power to a consensus of equal peers, together we can find solutions to overcome challenges. Where politicians and leaders have failed, bitcoin succeeds. Our surrender to this scientific process opens a door for development of protocol and gives innovation a chance for humanity to save itself from the mess we have created.

                            Japanese City Seeks Bitcoin Donations to Preserve Historic Park                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/japanese-city-raises-bitcoin-donations-preserve-historic-park/,"As part of a bid to preserve a historic park, a city in Japan is reportedly raising donations in bitcoin. The city of Hirosaki, according to a report from national public broadcaster NHK, is collecting funds to maintain more than 2,000 cherry blossom trees, as well as a centuries-old castle. Supporting the measure is Tokyo-based bitcoin wallet and exchange service Coincheck. According to figures posted on its website, 0.5749 BTC has so far been raised (worth roughly $720 at press time) from 40 contributors. While small, the amount would no doubt help chip away at the expenses of the park in Hirosaki, as NHK reports the municipality spends hundreds of thousands of dollars per year on upkeep. The broadcaster also suggested the digital currency has caught the attention of local officials who see it as a possible vehicle for addressing issues related to fundraising more generally. “Deputy mayor Noboru Yamamoto says the virtual currency may provide a solution to other Japanese local authorities at a time when most are struggling to raise funds,” NHK reported. Bitcoin has served as a donation tool for much of its history. Groups ranging from the Red Cross of America to Save the Children have turned the cryptocurrency into a way to collect contributions.

                            Spreads Widen at Bitcoin Exchanges Amid Bitfinex Banking Issues                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/spreads-widen-bitcoin-exchanges-amid-bitfinex-banking-issues/," Bitfinex's banking issues appear to be affecting the wider bitcoin exchange markets. As fiat withdrawal problems at the world's largest US dollar bitcoin exchange continued today, the spread between bitcoin prices observed on Bitfinex and other international exchanges surged, rising to more than $90, or roughly 7%, in some cases. At approximately 17:15 UTC, for example, bitcoin traded at $1,325 on Bitfinex, roughly $92 (or 7% higher) than the price of $1,233 observed on itBit, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The spread was similar on Bitstamp and CoinBase's GDAX exchange – where the digital currency traded at an $85 spread at that time. The difference was smaller when observed on OKCoin, though OKCoin has also reported banking issues in recent days. These figures were sharply higher than the start of the session, when bitcoin was trading at $1,265 on Bitfinex, approximately $50 higher than the price on both itBit and GDAX, according to data from the CoinDesk BPI. At press time, these price gaps continued to be outsized with a $60 spread observed between Bitstamp and GDAX and Bitfinex. The development follows Bitfinex's announcement today that it is unable to send wire transfers overseas due to challenges with its correspondent banks. At first, Bitfinex claimed it was informed by these financial institutions that the exchange lacked the ability to process transfers involving Hong Kong dollars and Swiss francs. While the exchange said it was able to make some transfers involving these fiat currencies, the financial institutions later informed Bitfinex it would no longer be able to make transfers using these currencies. These difficulties come days after Bitfinex announced on 13th April that its USD withdrawals were suffering delays. On 17th April, it further said its Taiwan-based banking providers were refusing incoming wire transfers. At the time, the exchange emphasized that it was working on ""alternative solutions"" that would allow its customers to make deposits and withdrawals using fiat currencies. Still, while this has stoked worries about a Mt Gox-style insolvency, the exchange vehemently denied these allegations today. It's worth noting, too, that Bitfinex has a history of bouncing back from issues as well, as it recently finished paying back users for a $65m hack experienced early last August. While it remains to be seen how the situation will unfold, with BTC-e and OKCoin joining Bitfinex in announcing banking issues, the developments have sparked some fears of wider crackdowns on exchanges. BTC-e representatives told CoinDesk its issue had to do with a third-party payment service, Mayzus, one it reported happens multiple times a year. As such, it's possible the uptick in issues is merely reflective of the tough environment bitcoin businesses have always faced when seeking to secure banking partnerships.

                            Bitcoin MSB Exemption Goes to New Hampshire Governor for Approval                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-msb-exemption-new-hampshire-approval/,"Senators in New Hampshire have passed a bill that would exempt digital currency traders from money transmission regulations, advancing the measure to the state's governor for signature. HB436, first filed in mid-January, aims to create an exception from money transmission requirements for ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"". The proposal drew both supporters and critics – grassroots advocates on one side, state officials like New Hampshire’s chief banking regulator on the other – and in a vote early last month, the state House of Representatives passed the measure and sent to the Senate. When reached, Senate representative told CoinDesk the bill earlier today passed by a 13-10 vote, and it now goes to Governor Chris Sununu for signature. Public records show that the Senate’s Commerce Committee – which considered the bill before advancing it to the full chamber – gave their nod of approval despite pleas from officials in the state to either amend or reject the bill outright. During a hearing earlier this month, representatives from both the New Hampshire Banking Department and Department of Justice argued against the bill. Their testimony was in sharp contrast with both grassroots supporters and the bill’s sponsors in the House, who argued that the exemption would benefit the state in the long run. New Hampshire’s push toward digital currency regulation is unique among efforts in other US states, which have largely seen legislative actions that lean toward more scrutiny of digital currency activities.

                            OKCoin Becomes Latest Bitcoin Exchange to Freeze US Dollar Deposits                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/okcoin-bitcoin-freeze-us-dollar/,"Chinese digital currency exchange OKCoin has stopped accepting US dollar deposits, a move it attributed to banking issues. OKCoin becomes the latest cryptocurrency service to report problems with USD transfers, coming just a day after Bitfinex revealed that it, too, wouldn’t be able to accept transfers, citing correspondent bank problems that initially focused on outgoing wires. When reached, an online support staffer for OKCoin told CoinDesk that the exchange currently doesn’t have an exact timeline for reactivation. The exchange told users yesterday that it was working to restore deposit functions through alternative channels. ""Please do not make further deposits as your wires may be rejected by intermediary banks,"" a notice posted on the exchange’s website stated.  The move comes months after OKCoin, as well as other exchanges based in China, shifted policies in light of new regulatory scrutiny and later froze bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals pending upgrades to their systems. That state of affairs continues, a situation local sources have attributed to ongoing discussions with the People’s Bank of China (China’s central bank) and other regulators in the country. It also follows the release by OKCoin of beefed up anti-money laundering/know-your-customer requirements on 10th April. Other exchanges have reported transfer holds as well, though how the developments are connected isn't immediately clear. Crypto-exchange BTC-e, for example, said that it wouldn’t accept international transfers in USD for the next month, citing a shift to a new bank account in a post on Twitter from 14th April.

                            A New Tool Might Finally Make Banks Comfortable With Bitcoin                        ",Aaron Stanley,https://www.coindesk.com/a-new-tool-might-finally-make-banks-comfortable-with-bitcoin/," Bitcoin intelligence provider Elliptic is rolling out a program with California-based Silvergate Bank to analyze and screen possible nefarious activity on the bitcoin blockchain. The effort is focused on helping banks assess future bitcoin-based business clients. For banks, often the associated risks are deemed higher than the potential rewards when considering new clients that operate in the bitcoin space – an often-cited stumbling block in the industry. ""The banks that are working with bitcoin companies really don’t have much visibility into how effective they are at handling the risk associated with bitcoin transactions,"" said James Smith, Elliptic's CEO. Smith told CoinDesk: Elliptic's software allows financial institutions to take a more robust approach in vetting bitcoin businesses and complying with know-your-customer (KYC), anti-money laundering (AML) and Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) requirements. The platform will help banks find suspicious bitcoin activity, allowing them to reduce risk assessment costs for current and potential customers, while demonstrating to regulators that there are internal safeguards in place to weed out bad actors. ""We see this as a great step forward in terms of raising the industry standard, in terms of compliance, improving the level of risk mitigation and, ultimately, allowing Silvergate to work with more businesses who are handling bitcoin,"" said Smith. While beneficial in this regard, Silvergate is already one of the exceptions to the rule in the banking world when it comes to bitcoin. The bank currently provides services to more than 30 bitcoin-related companies, including digital currency exchanges, institutional investors, miners and software developers. Still, those involved in the project argue better visibility will in turn aid banks as the regulatory environment moves to one where banks are now responsible for their customer's customers as well. Plus, Silvergate and Elliptic argue that the platform will allow financial institutions to better assess when their customers' internal controls may be suspect. ""What we’re looking for is to see how a client is performing over time as an indication of whether their internal control environment is getting stronger,"" said Ben Reynolds, vice president of business development and digital banking at Silvergate. Similar to Elliptic's other anti-money laundering products, the platform screens each blockchain transaction for potential linkages to suspicious activity and then issues each with a risk score. While efforts to separate the allegedly 'good' bitcoin users from the 'bad' ones have been met with pushback from certain factions of the bitcoin community, Elliptic and Silvergate emphasize that the goal is not to micromanage clients, but rather to understand holistically what clients are doing to filter out eyebrow-raising activity. ""What they want to know is – at a high level – what percentage of transactions going through this business are suspicious? How has that changed over time? Does it look like they are improving their controls?"" said Smith. The bottom line, Reynolds said, is that the software will soften Silvergate’s overall risk management overhead. ""For us, each client that we take on initially is a pretty large investment in terms of the due diligence process that we go through,"" he said. Reynolds went on to explain that while Silvergate has no regulatory obligation to enact such a program, it's being proactive to advance the legitimacy, credibility and sustainability of the bitcoin industry and pushback on negative stereotypes. Smith concluded: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Elliptic. Silvergate Bank image via La Jolla Center

The San Francisco-based startup, founded in 2011, is launching the updated deposit feature effectively immediately, though the withdrawal upgrade won't go live until 24th April, the exchange said. It's a notable service update given the timing and the state of the global bitcoin exchange space. For example, Bitfinex, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by USD volume, said yesterday that it is now unable to accept inbound wire transfers due to banking problems. The British Virgin Islands-based company had previously gone to court over issues related to outbound wire transfers denominated in USD (only to withdraw that suit a week later). Further, China's exchange ecosystem, under effective lockdown due to regulatory pressures, has yet to reactivate bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals amidst ongoing discussion with the People’s Bank of China, the country’s central bank. So far, bitcoin's market has continued its upward momentum in the face of these challenges, though that's not to say there isn't concern.

It concluded with a rooftop party, had controversial dancing girls and saw one startup hand out bitcoin wallets with neon vodka shots. That's probably what most people remember about The North American Bitcoin Conference Miami. Organized by Moe Levin and held in the days when bitcoin's price had gone from a few dollars to more than the price of gold, the industry had yet to hit the turbulence that this early success would bring. As an industry without leaders, a governing structure or centralized control, we relied – and still rely – on our peers. This isn't just for validating transactions and making sure that the network works, but for sharing news, knowledge and the social interaction needed to keep pace with change. Because of the lack of structure, events are particularly important, and early industry events had an entirely different character than most do today. What many might forget about TNABC 2014, however, is that it was simultaneously the last of the era of pure 'community events' and the first of the 'business events' to follow. At my first bitcoin conference, for example, I wore the standard 'uniform' of a venture capitalist or investment professional: khaki pants, a collared dress shirt and a blazer. I was vastly overdressed. To try to blend in with a sea of casual T-shirts, leather jackets and Phineas Gage (who was wearing a pink tutu), I quietly slid off my blazer crumpled it into a ball and threw it in the corner. During the coffee break, I introduced myself to a young hacker-looking fellow and mentioned that I was interested in the technology and came from the world of investment management. I don't think he meant it in a rude way when he responded:  By January 2014, the industry had changed: record price highs and new interest from investors were shaping the landscape. Someone wearing a suit coat would now no longer be alone. Indeed, a few professional-looking executives were sitting near the front row in Miami, and whispers could be heard saying, ""See those guys? They are venture capitalists! Here! At a bitcoin event!"" The thought that serious investors would be interested in this industry was both exciting and validating. Outside my hotel room, an orange Lamborghini was parked bearing the license plate ""BitPay"", a wise publicity stunt for one of the few young startups seeking to raise early venture investments around a bitcoin business. The conference hall still had that same exciting buzz that was characteristic of the earliest bitcoin events – few, if any of us, were attending with any hopes or expectations of an ROI. There was no division, no scaling debate, no pressure from investors to deliver, no rivalries, no major regulatory involvement and no notable agendas, just pure energy and excitement about something new. The attendees walked from room to room overwhelmed with positive energy and a steady flow of information.  Steve Beauregard took the stage at the event, as did Charlie Lee. Shortly after the major announcement that TigerDirect would be one of the first major retailers to accept bitcoin as a payment option, Roger Ver gave a presentation that very few of us had seen before. He talked about the potential for this technology, he reassured many that it was ""not too late"" to become involved and he closed with a heartfelt statement that people having control of their own money can reduce war. I'm sure I was not the only one in the audience who had a tear in their eye thinking about the potential of this amazing technology. After hearing from Jeff Berwick and Elizabeth Ploshay (now McCauley), I headed to the adjacent conference room to hear from a young entrepreneur named Charlie Shrem. I was particularly interested in his thoughts on the upcoming BitLicense hearings, which were scheduled for later that week. As we all now know, Charlie never made it to Miami nor to testify at the BitLicense hearings (he was arrested at the airport in New York). His arrest was used as fuel for Ben Lawsky's media show, and would throw the hearings into disarray, placing bitcoin proponents on the defensive.  As if the event had not been eventful enough, a very young man named Vitalik Buterin – who's title on the program handout was ""Head Writer at Bitcoin Magazine"" – started his presentation in the main room. This was the first announcement of a brand-new project called ethereum. Now an accomplished presenter with hundreds of engagements under his belt, the Vitalik of January 2014 was nowhere near as polished. On his first major public speaking event, he seemed a bit nervous and hard to follow. Whatever lack of polish he may have had in his presentation skills, however, did not hamper interest in this project. After listening with rapt attention, at the conclusion of his presentation, a mob of a couple dozen people swarmed the then little-known 19-year-old. Forty-something computer scientists and developers flocked to learn more about joining the project, some of them reportedly changing careers to join ethereum right on the spot. Brock Pierce and Nic Cary concluded the day's speakers.  Buzzing from information overload, I retired to my room at The Clevelander. It was a day full of excitement and energy. It was a lot to process. And looking back, there were hints of the troubles to come as well. Earlier in the day, an experienced bitcoiner warned me about impending troubles at an exchange called Mt Gox. Tired as I was, I decided to heed his advice and move my bitcoins out of the exchange. I received an error message mentioning something about issues with a hot wallet. I broke my withdrawals into smaller pieces and was able to get them to execute. I did several transfers this way until I received a different error: ""Bitcoin withdrawals are suspended until further notice"". This suspension would, of course, never be lifted. But I wasn't concerned then. As I drifted to sleep, I reflected on the incredible people I had met, the weekend and exciting potential ahead. It was wild and crazy, a space filled with the most interesting and eclectic group of geeks, geniuses and rebels I had ever seen. The early days of pure speculation were ending. I was sure real capital and established interests were moving in. This proved true. We'd have some 'group hug' moments, but we'd never again be the eager, wide-eyed band of idealists who came together in Miami. Like many, I thought to myself: Images courtesy of TNABC

                            Traders Raise Concern as Biggest Bitcoin Exchange Halts Deposits                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-raise-concerns-largest-us-dollar-exchange-halts-deposits/," An announcement by one of the world's largest bitcoin exchanges has stoked fears another Mt Gox-style meltdown may be brewing. The largest bitcoin exchange by US dollar volume in recent weeks, Bitfinex revealed today it will be unable to accept incoming wires starting tomorrow, a statement that comes after it disclosed late last week that it was experiencing delays in US dollar withdrawals. The exchange said in a statement today: Notably, Bitfinex didn't offer any details as to why the banks – the subject of a previous wire transfer dispute that began earlier this month – will not accept the transfers. (The exchange ultimately went to court over the decision, but withdrew its lawsuit one week later.) While Bitfinex is said to now be working on solutions to its banking issues, market observers are suggesting cause for concern. Jacob Eliosoff, cryptocurrency fund manager, spoke to the general reaction that this situation has so far provoked, discussing how the resulting freeze in withdrawals could create abnormal pressures in the market. ""This is a dynamic many of us remember from the Mt Gox days when there were problems with fiat withdrawals,"" he said. ""Investors responded by converting fiat they had on the exchange to bitcoin so they could withdraw it. [In other words], they buy bitcoin to withdraw, pushing up the price on the exchange."" Eliosoff went so far as to state that some market observers could perhaps view this as an opportunity for arbitrage, using it as an excuse to deposit bitcoin in order to sell at the high price and buy the bitcoin back again. Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, provided a similar sentiment. ""The hiatus [of] Bitfinex's banking facilities have led to a rush by some to extricate their bitcoin from the exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk. Because of these developments, exchange spreads have widened, with Bitfinex enjoying a more than $50 premium in some cases at the time of report, according to data from CryptoCompare. Bitcoin was trading at roughly $1,235 at 18:55 UTC on Bitfinex, compared to roughly $1,185 on Bitstamp and $1,190 on GDAX. The spread harkens back to the final days of Mt Gox, when data showed the exchange consistently traded between 10% and 26% above its competitors. While analysts voiced their concerns, they were optimistic that Bitfinex would emerge from this situation unscathed. The victim of a hack last August, Bitfinex has shown a propensity to bounce back from operational difficulties. After losing nearly $65m in customer funds, it would go on to ""socialize"" losses among exchange users, using a new cryptographic token to credit customers. The system would later win praise from supporters, who saw it as a creative way to avoid bankruptcy and pay back users. Hayter offered similar input, emphasizing that Bitfinex has a ""solid"" reputation. ""The hope is this will be dealt with in a timely and professional manner,"" he said. Eliosoff concluded: Market image via Shutterstock

Last week, India revealed that it has convened a special committee that will develop and report back on possible regulatory approaches to the tech. The country’s central bank and several government departments, including its main tax authority, are taking part. In new statements, the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India – formed earlier this year to represent the domestic industry’s interests – says it wants to play a role in those discussions. Members include bitcoin exchanges Unocoin and Coinsecure, as well as wallet service Zebpay and online search startup Searchtrade. The group says it wants to meet with the committee, explaining in a statement: As for what position the Indian government might fully adopt, outside observers will just have to wait and see. More than three years ago, the Reserve Bank of India issued a warning to domestic consumers about the risks involved in buying digital currencies. The central bank has issued updated versions of that warning, most recently earlier this year – sparking concerns that the government was about to ban bitcoin. Megaphone image via Shutterstock

As detailed in a patent application published last week by the US Patent and Trademark Office, the proposed system would receive data from the bitcoin network as a means of keeping contracts up to date – monitoring metrics like network difficulty and price. CME previously launched a pair of bitcoin price indexes last year. The filing is notable as bitcoin mining, the process by which new transactions are added to the bitcoin blockchain, is a kind of commodities production. Miners expend energy and manpower in exchange for newly minted bitcoins. Yet, the ever-rising difficulty of mining can mean ever-encroaching costs for for miners. With the mining derivative, ""a miner can lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor"", the patent filing reads. The application goes on to explain: Per the application, CME envisions the bitcoin mining derivative as a way to position against the depreciation of mining hardware as well. ""...as the difficulty factor rises, mining computers may become less marketable, so taking a long position in the generated contract, or being long a call option on the generated contract, would allow manufacturers to lock in a projected growth rate of the difficulty factor and hedge against the risk of falling hardware prices,"" CME continues. CME first applied for the patent on 13th October, 2015. Mansoor Ahmed, Ryan Pierce and Sandra Ro are listed as inventors.

Founded in 2013, the startup provides a means for employers to pay their workers in bitcoin or fiat currencies, using bitcoin as a way to quickly move money worldwide. Bitwage said today it is now offering unique International Bank Account Number (IBAN) to EU customers who subscribe to its premium service, as well as those who see monthly transaction volumes in excess of €1,999. An IBAN is a unique string of numbers signifying a specific bank account, and should see customers able to access wages more quickly. Previously, an EU-based customer might have found themselves waiting for a claim to go through. ""With our new unique IBANs, users receiving wages for EU companies no longer need to create deposit claims, as payment descriptions are no longer required for these transactions,"" the startup said in a statement. San Francisco-based Bitwage further positioned the upgrade as part of a broader push into the European market, saying: The firm raised $760,000 at the end of 2015 in a seed funding round, and just over a year ago moved to add support for credit card payments.

                            'User-Generated Currency': Bitcoin and the YouTube of Money                        ",Galia Benartzi,https://www.coindesk.com/user-generated-currency-bitcoin-youtube-money/,"Galia Benartzi is a founder of Bancor, a Swiss-based non-profit focused on solving the liquidity challenge in asset exchange. Previously, she was founder and CEO of Particle Code, a cross-platform development technology for mobile and social games acquired by Appcelerator. In this opinion piece, Benartzi discusses why she believes the ability of blockchain technologies to create many currencies could create a 'long tail' of new commerce opportunities.  Money, when it comes down to it, is a tool for collaboration. Money moves human energy, skills and time between us, in different 'containers', or stores of value. National stores of value, like the US dollar, have historically been controlled by governments and distributed by banks. This, of course, happens with limited transparency, a combined domestic and international monetary policy agenda, and political considerations throughout. Naturally, this model is far more inflexible and inaccessible than newer cryptocurrency solutions, made possible by blockchain database technology that can theoretically enable anyone to issue and distribute a digital store of value. In fact, we're just beginning to see the blockchain ecosystem give rise to these new forms of money that can be issued at little to no cost. Because cryptocurrencies allow us to account and transfer value securely between one another without the need for an intermediary, such as a bank, we can finally join and create local and group value networks that operate reliably, with little overhead or tedious monitoring. Communities of any flavor can now be empowered to agree on credit-issuing policies and governance structures, and enjoy internal marketplaces from which to buy and sell goods or services, without relying on access to national money. Today’s first use cases are produced by early adopters, and already we see hundreds, nearing thousands, of cryptocurrencies on the market and counting. But as technical barriers to entry are removed, we are on the precipice of millions of user-generated currencies, of all shapes and sizes. This is similar to inflection points in user-generated content we saw with the rise of WordPress for blogs and YouTube for video. Similarly, the long tail of value creation will produce a large variety of monetary diversity and abundance from greatly enhanced collaboration between people. In business, the 'long tail' describes content and products in low demand or with low sales or view volume that, collectively, make up a market share exceeding that of current top performers combined. Internet history shows us that with the digital long tail, the accumulation of all niche contributions is actually two to three orders of magnitude greater than the hits. Think of all the Instagram accounts after the 1,000 most followed, or all the status updates beyond the most viral. In cryptocurrency, the long tail points to hundreds of billions in potential value when combining all small and niche currencies beyond the few largest. It's an idea that's been tried before. For example, my founding team previously built technology for local currency initiatives. One of our most successful projects became the largest alternative currency in Israel where it was used. There, a community of new mothers issued a currency called 'Hearts' that allowed thousands of active moms to buy and sell from each other in a mobile app which combined a currency wallet and trusted peer-to-peer marketplace. The community generated hundreds of transactions every day for years, with millions of dollars-worth of value changing hands, including jewelry, apparel, household and children’s goods and lifestyle services. Over time, as other currencies were issued in neighboring communities, it became clear that being able to exchange these stores of value for each other would give them even greater usage, as new products and services would be available in other networks beyond yours. Many local businesses were eager to offer their products for their customers’ community currencies, which would further enhance product selection, but their inability to liquidate these back to national money was a barrier. Even though these currencies were creating value for users, they were too small to achieve the trade volume needed for liquidity. This is the main reason we haven't yet seen the user-generated-currency inflection point. Combined with the technical difficulty still involved in the creation of a cryptocurrency, what you see today are early adopters limited to crypto startups with deep development expertise and a business strategy for liquidity. When technical barriers are lowered and the liquidity problem is solved, the emergence of the user-generated-currency long tail may end up being the greatest long tail in internet history. Its combined volume won't represent the profit or traffic of its enabler (such as YouTube’s ownership of the video long-tail) but rather the collective abundance, as measured by the velocities and market caps of these currencies, accruing directly to their users. This access to diverse capital may usher in a more even distribution curve of wealth in society. And we will measure that wealth not only in dollars or euros, or even bitcoins, but in the transfer of goods and services within each network and community, unconstrained by structural monetary inefficiencies.

                            Is Safe Haven Scarcity Becoming a Boon For Bitcoin?                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/safe-haven-asset-scarcity-becoming-boon-bitcoin/," While the strict regulations that emerged following the 2007–2008 financial crisis drew fire from many industry participants, they may have had an unintended consequence: making bitcoin more appealing to investors. Following the crisis, regulators created a complex framework of rules and regulations designed to ensure the continued stability of the global financial system. The new framework affected many different facets of the financial services industry, including financial institutions involved in trading. Under the new rules, investors frequently need to deposit cash (known as 'margin') when making trades. This margin is often left at clearinghouses, which act as intermediaries and help ensure that trades still take place even if one party gets cold feet. These clearinghouses then take this cash and lend it out for safe assets, such as German bunds or US Treasury bonds, through the repurchase agreement or 'repo' market, which enables them to make short-term loans. This entire process has had the effect of making certain safe assets – specifically high-quality government bonds – increasingly scarce. And this situation could potentially grow more severe, Yves Mersch, member of the European Central Bank's Executive Board, warned recently. He stated during a January speech: While clearinghouses have been snapping up safe assets, they are certainly not alone in this respect. Central banks around the world have been acting similarly, purchasing trillions of dollars worth of bonds following the financial crisis. One major objective of this quantitative easing (QE) was placing downward pressure on interest rates in an attempt to bolster lending and stimulate economic growth. These efforts have been largely successful, as interest rates have stayed very low for several years. While QE has helped create an environment of low interest rates (and therefore modest borrowing costs), it has had an unintended consequence of placing downward pressure on yields. The current environment has caused many investors to embark upon a search for yield, which in turn has drawn investors to bitcoin, according to several analysts who spoke with CoinDesk. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, spoke to this aspect of the digital currency, saying, ""It's not so much a shortage of safe haven assets, so much as low yields in all asset classes"" that makes bitcoin appealing. The low-yield environment is ""driving the appetite for crypto currencies across the board"", he added. Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, also spoke to the key need created by the current lack of high-yielding investment opportunities, as well as how he believes the situation is fueling demand for bitcoin: Bitcoin prices have frequently enjoyed tailwinds during times of geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. As a result, the capital markets have come to understand bitcoin's value as a ""disaster hedge,"" ARK Invest analyst Chris Burniske told CoinDesk. Should the economy fall into recession, or the stock market decline, bitcoin prices could benefit significantly. While investors tend to seek out safer securities during times of economic turmoil, the general lack of such assets could prompt them to flock to bitcoin instead. Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, has been preparing for such an event, recently telling CoinDesk: ""Our new fund specifically targets high net worth clients and institutions so they can park their money in an alternative asset."" He continued: Other analysts offered a more complicated assessment, with Eliosoff emphasizing that, while a downturn would ""likely"" provide bitcoin with tailwinds, it might depend on what factors caused the downturn to materialize in the first place. Michael Moro, CEO of Genesis Global Trading, added further detail to the situation, emphasizing that ""safe"" is a relative term. He also noted that geography can play a key role in investors' decisions. Moro stated: Historically, bitcoin prices have not correlated with those of other assets – a point raised by Moro. Should a recession or financial crisis take place, this is another aspect that could make the digital currency very attractive. During times of crisis, investors frequently panic, selling off many different assets and causing several different kinds of securities to lose value simultaneously. Should such panic selling take place, investors may find that bitcoin, with its status as as a unique and uncorrelated asset class, is even more appealing than it would be otherwise.

The 50-page document, released by Ohio’s Office of the Inspector General this week, outlines a plot in which the two inmates at the Marion Correctional Institution went so far as to maintain two makeshift computers hidden above their cell. Though details about how they used the digital currency were scarce, a search for clues by state investigators turned up bitcoin wallets on the prison’s computer system, along with other clues indicating an identity fraud plot. The report explained: The two inmates were able to effectively hijack the system by using stolen information from a former corrections employee and computers obtained from a hardware salvage program conducted at the prison. Who’s to blame? Primarily prison staff, according to the report, who were faulted for not reporting the incident and for failing to properly secure the scene after it was discovered. Representatives for the prison told CBS News that they had since moved to adopt the recommendations suggested in the report. The full report can be found below: 2015-CA00043 by CoinDesk on Scribd

The sale of nChain – formerly known as EITC Holdings – was announced yesterday. The buyer is a Malta-based investment fund, High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc, which is managed by Zürich-based Accuro Fund Solutions. A group of companies affiliated with nChain was also acquired as part of the deal. An investigative report published by Reuters last summer connected Wright to EITC, through which as many as 50 patent applications were filed in the UK. Public records show that EITC submitted several dozen patent applications throughout 2016. Wright made global headlines in late 2015 after several publications identified him as the possible face behind Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin. Word that Wright was the subject of an Australian tax investigation and reports of police raids further heightened the situation. The developments culminated in a media frenzy when Wright moved to prove that he was indeed Satoshi – only to drop the bid amid growing scrutiny and criticism. Yet as the controversy abated, rumors began to circulate in the industry that there may be developments related to intellectual property. But, according to the firm's announcement, nChain may be planning a more open approach to the patents it is seeking. In its release, nChain said that it ""intends to make some of its intellectual property assets available to the blockchain community through open source software and royalty-free licensing"" sometime this year. However, the firm gave no indication when that process might actually begin. Image Credit: BBC

 Senate Bill 5031, public records show, has cleared both chambers of the state's legislature, setting it up to be sent to the office of Governor Jay Inslee. The bill was first introduced in January, clearing its first vote the following month. While not guaranteed to be signed, the broad support the bill attracted signals that it may pass. Still, its contents could lead some digital currency-focused startups to think twice about operating in the state – and in the past year, several firms have already pulled out, citing a difficult regulatory environment. The bill represents an update to the state's existing money transmission laws, in order to make them account for firms that handle digital currencies. According to the text of the measure, businesses would be required to maintain reserves – denominated in the relevant digital currency – equal to the funds they retain on behalf of their customers. The bill states: Other requirements include mandatory third-party cybersecurity audits of ""all electronic information and data systems"", the text reads. Even absent the new legislation, the past months have shown that some startups working with the tech have moved to steer clear of the state. These include digital currency exchanges Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Poloniex, the latter of which moved to exit Washington just last week. According to an email circulating on social media and dated 8th April, Poloniex said that it would be suspending services to customers in the state after 21st April.

                            From AsicBoost to UASF: Greg Maxwell on Bitcoin's Path Forward                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/asicboost-uasf-greg-maxwell-bitcoins-path-forward/,"""I'm sort of being scooped on the details by people just working it out for themselves now."" Despite kickstarting another fierce period in bitcoin's now years-long scaling debate, Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell admits even he's a bit lost in the narrative he created last week. That's when Maxwell posted a public note alleging an unnamed miner (largely assumed to be China-based Bitmain) was secretly using a more efficient mining technique, giving them an upper hand over other miners. Thickening the plot was that he alleged that this was the reason the company doesn't support Segregated Witness (SegWit), a preferred technical solution to the network's capacity issues that would accidentally turn off the technique. With the post, Maxwell unintentionally kicked off a grassroots movement in support of pushing SegWit through by way of circumventing miners altogether, the latest in a long line of new technical proposals. Called a user-activated soft fork (UASF), there are currently at least two groups working on a form of the idea, with a mess of discussion about whether the network can and should make technical upgrades in this way. Still, Maxwell argues that this process, by which users and node operators aim to quarterback technical changes, might be the preferred way to make upgrades to the network in certain instances. Maxwell told CoinDesk: But, is a UASF safe? While there's been an upsurge in support, the upgrading method is controversial. Maxwell mentioned, as others have, that the change requires ""very, very broad"" support from the ecosystem. Yet, the trouble is, it's difficult to measure what bitcoin users really want and if there is such support. Many point to bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) 16 as a successful UASF, but it's actually one example where the method didn't go entirely smoothly. After activation, one pool mined invalid blocks for a couple of months (although, perhaps to its disadvantage and no one else's). That's one reason that developers have been using a different method, Maxwell said. It's easier to deploy a consensus-level rule change if miners commit to upgrading and enforcing those rules. Despite those challenges, Maxwell contended that some form of a UASF might be the best option right now. If some miners are indeed running AsicBoost – the alternative mining method Bitmain is accused of employing – it poses a conflict of interest, as they don't want to push through a fix for economic reasons, he contends. And, in his opinion, there are other tradeoffs to think about: On that basis, Maxwell advocates for a form of a UASF to fix mining practice profiled in his mailing list post, but with a slower rollout than others have proposed. Maxwell said that discussions are still ongoing and it will probably be a few months before developers start writing the code. For now, however, other groups are seeking faster solutions. One UASF proposal, BIP 148, the one with a website and a Twitter account, is gaining support with announcements that certain companies are in favor of the idea currently dominating social media. (Fifteen percent of bitcoin companies now support the BIP, up from five percent on Monday, according to one measure.) Maxwell is more cautious, though. ""They're proposing time frames that I think the regular developers are not quite as comfortable with,"" he said. But, he didn't write off the effort. ""Ultimately, bitcoin is owned by its users and by the people who own bitcoin,"" he said. ""I’m very interested in seeing where this stuff goes.” Overall, Maxwell discussed the process in a largely academic tone, taking the recent developments as simply part and parcel to the kind of decision making that he seems to suggest is natural for a disparate community. Stories about life-changing hugs aside, community discussions have been tense amid the block-size debate, with discussion dominating Twitter and Reddit at a constant clip. One of the most obvious questions now is, what will come of the accusations against Bitmain?  As for how and where the community could find the missing pieces of the story, Maxwell didn't have an answer. He noted, however, that others have replicated his findings, posting them to Reddit. Further, although he plans to release more information about the chip in question, he said it's not a priority because Bitmain already disclosed that it has used AsicBoost on its chip for testing. Bitmain has denied that it is conducting its mining operations as alleged, and that this is the reason it does not support SegWit. For all the contention this past week, Maxwell was largely optimistic when discussing the network's future outlook, framing the ongoing debate as necessary. ""It's a consensus system after all,"" he said, concluding: Greg Maxwell image via CoinDesk

The comments from Maxim Grigoriev, head of the Bank of Russia's Center for Financial Technologies, came after a senior official with the Russian Ministry of Finance first floated the idea bitcoin could be considered for legal recognition sometime in 2018 during an interview with Bloomberg earlier this week. That idea, as might be expected, struck some as a sharp turnaround for the Russian government, which as early as 2015 was weighing steep penalties for the creation and distribution of so-called money surrogates, a category which would have covered digital currencies. Government ministers later backed away from that position, as indicated by reports from last year. According to TASS, Grigoriev confirmed that 2018 would see some kind of regulatory position emerge from Russia's government, though he reportedly cautioned that discussions were ongoing as to what that position might be. Grigoriev said, according to a translation: The government's push toward finalizing digital currency regulation comes as agencies in Russia are exploring applications of blockchain in the public sector. In early March, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev ordered two government ministries and a state-owned development bank to research possible uses. Bank of Russia image via Shutterstock

                            'Into the War Room': Overstock Looks Back on Bitcoin Embrace                        ",Jonathan Johnson,https://www.coindesk.com/into-the-war-room-overstock-looks-back-on-bitcoin-embrace/,"Jonathan Johnson is the chairman of the board of Overstock and the president of Medici Ventures, the Overstock subsidiary focused on advancing blockchain technology in financial systems and beyond. In this entry for CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Johnson discusses his involvement in Overstock's decision to become the first major US merchant to accept bitcoin, and the influences that led it to kickstart what would be a frenzy of bitcoin activity in the retail industry.  Sometime in early 2013, my high school-aged sons began asking me when Overstock would accept bitcoin. At this time, I was the president of Overstock and, I sheepishly admit, it was the first I'd heard of bitcoin. I began studying bitcoin and watching how it was used. Unbeknownst to me, my business partner, Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne, was doing exactly the same. In particular, he was watching how bitcoin was being successfully used around the world after the Cyprus bailout and studying its underlying blockchain technology. Toward the end of the year, the two of us began to talk about bitcoin... *** As bitcoin interest and adoption grew, we saw technological, capitalistic and philosophic reasons to offer our customers a secure, decentralized, immutable way to buy products. In December 2013, wanting to make it possible for bitcoin users to purchase products from us, we included our senior management team in the discussion. And the team quickly decided bitcoin as a payment method was a good idea. Because Overstock had lots of projects in the queue, we figured Overstock would get to coding the bitcoin project sometime during the first half of 2014. But, as news of this decision spread throughout the company, 40 of our best developers, all eager to be involved in the bitcoin project, wanted to speed it up. ""Why take six months? This is a big deal,"" they said. Our developers volunteered for immediate duty. *** Straight away, we formed a team that began work the week between Christmas and New Year's. Wanting to be undistracted and uninterrupted, the team locked themselves in a room (and asked that pizza be slid under the door) so they could work on integrating the technology into our website. (At Overstock, we often create special project teams and give them their own ""war room"" so they can focus on the project.) This was just such a case. The team was singularly focused on the project over the holidays. They were bitcoin believers and it showed in their dedication to the project. After just two weeks of hard work, on 9th January, 2014, Overstock became the first major retailer to accept bitcoin. *** The buzz among the bitcoin community was huge. The press was quick to tout our pioneering action. Bitcoin holders came to Overstock in droves to purchase products. In the following weeks and months, Patrick and I were asked to speak about bitcoin and why Overstock decided to accept the cryptocurrency. While the decision to accept bitcoin seems like an easy and smart one, in retrospect, there were a number of factors that led our team to conclude an alternative currency was a good fit for Overstock. Overstock is a technology company at its core. We built our brand around leveraging technologies to provide our customers with the best possible shopping experience. Because of this, we constantly experiment with new technologies across a variety of applications. Bitcoin was no exception. As we began to better understand bitcoin’s underlying technology – the blockchain – it was clear the decentralized and distributed infrastructure allowed for almost no possibility of exploitation. That, when combined with the immutable nature of the ledger, provided a level of security and transparency never before seen in a currency. *** When we began accepting bitcoin, we accessed a new demographic of customers with plenty of bitcoin to spend, but few places to spend it. The bitcoin community is a loyal and engaged one, and we believed they would return Overstock's faith in the currency with continued patronage. We were right. Fiscally, the decision made a great deal of sense, too. We eliminated credit card transaction costs on bitcoin purchases, thus increasing our profit within the tight margins of e-commerce. Bitcoin still combines the convenience, transparency and security of an online-based payment method with the virtues of a currency that has a finite supply of infinitely divisible units and predictable growth patterns. This duality supports our belief that a limited government, without the power to create currency at will for self-sustaining purposes, is the best business model for any nation. *** While you might not hear much about its retail use cases anymore, Overstock still accepts bitcoin. The digital currency's non-governmental nature still allows for easy global adoption, leading to efficient trade between individuals and companies without the cumbersome currency exchange processes and costs. Just as the internet allowed the world the freedom to communicate across borders and cultures, bitcoin and other non-governmental cryptocurrencies allow the world the freedom to trade goods in much the same way. Other retailers and industries soon followed our lead and the public began to see bitcoin less as a fringe idea and more as a safe, globally accessible way to purchase goods and services from reputable organizations. While bitcoin is responsible for less than 1% of our annual revenue, our experience integrating it with our website allowed us to understand the true potential of blockchain technology. In late 2014, we went so far as to create Medici Ventures, a subsidiary company focused on developing and advancing blockchain technology. Today, you can use bitcoin to pay for everything from a computer to a vacation to college tuition. And, it all started with saying yes to accepting.  Boxes image via Overstock.com

Their argument centers on whether the government of New Hampshire should take a proactive or reactive role in the regulation of money transmitters within the state that use digital currency. The bill, first proposed in mid-January, seeks to exempt ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"" from money transmission statutes in the state. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the measure attracted broad support from grassroots stakeholders. And last month, the state's House of Representatives cleared the bill by a 185-170 vote. From there, the proposal moved to the Senate for further deliberation, leading to last week's hearing before the Senate Commerce Committee. That hearing drew a number of supporters, including sponsors of the bill as well as activists from New Hampshire. Many of those who spoke before the panel pushed for its passage, arguing the measure would bring benefits to the state, according to a video published by the activist organization Free Keene. Yet officials from both the New Hampshire Banking Department and Department of Justice spoke against it, appealing to committee members to either oppose the bill or create tighter controls. Jerry Little, the states's banking commissioner, argued that, if passed into law, the measure would inhibit state regulators from preventing potential financial fraud, comparing the process to plane safety. Little asked the panel: Appearing later, James Boffetti, senior assistant attorney general for New Hampshire's Justice Department, spoke in support of the Banking Department's position, arguing that his agency wouldn't be able to police activity as effectively. ""If you remove this from the jurisdiction of the Banking Department, it default falls to the Department of Justice,"" he told the panel. ""But we don't have the same restitution capacities as the Banking Department. We don't have the expertise."" Image courtesy of Free Keene/YouTube

                            Sweden Incorporates Iran Investment Firm Using Only Bitcoin                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/sweden-incorporates-iran-investment-firm-using-only-bitcoin/,"Investing in Iran just got a whole lot easier. The Swedish government has allowed a blockchain startup to use a bitcoin account – as opposed to a traditional bank account – as a way to prove its liquidity and incorporate domestically with the Swedish Companies Registration Office, called Bolagsverket. While the founders of Linköping-based Brave New World Investments initially took their idea of creating an investment vehicle for companies traded on the Tehran Stock Exchange to the six largest banks in Sweden, each, they said, refused the idea. Investing in Iran is legal in Sweden, but concern among the banks that Brave New World Investments might be perceived as a violation of US sanctions against Iran proved an insurmountable obstacle. That is until the Bolagsverket registrar in charge of the case, Madeleine Idvardsson, helped the company incorporate without a bank account. Idvardsson told CoinDesk: To register a company in Sweden using bitcoin, the incorporators must provide a signed statement from an auditor that the value of the property is not higher than the actual company's value, among other requirements. The statement must be made by an authorized public accountant and described in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for how the property’s value was determined, along with any difficulties experienced during the process. The approval of Brave New World Investments was expedited by a previous approval that had been sent to Bolagsverket by the Swedish Accounting Standards Board for another bitcoin application. While banks have built-in security features to help prove the identity of their clientele, using bitcoin proved a bit more complicated. On 27th January at a pre-agreed time, two identical amounts of bitcoin were transmitted from predetermined bitcoin addresses to a another agreed-upon address that would serve as a substitute bank account. CoinDesk has viewed the transactions and can confirm their existence. Now empty, the account is reserved for incoming transactions, while operations will be paid for, also in bitcoin, using other accounts and local bitcoin service providers.
 Now that the company has been incorporated with a bitcoin account, Brave New World Investments co-founder Mikael Johansson told CoinDesk he is waiting for the final approval to open a bank account in Iran. Then, bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies will be used to send funds to Iran, where they will be converted to the native rial and used to invest in publicly traded companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange. Johansson said: Since the Iranian Revolution of 1979, nations around the world have held various sanctions against the country, with the US being the most vocal detractor of doing business with the country. In recent years, however, the nature of those sanctions has begun to evolve. For starters, since the US, the EU and others in 2015 signed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action for the peaceful development of nuclear energy in Iran, the EU has engaged in increased trade with the country. In the US, on the other hand, the response has been different. Last month, US president Donald Trump moved to tighten US sanctions on Iran, in response to missile tests he believes could prove to be a possible threat. Still, Johansson sees opportunity in the changing climate – for those willing to play by complicated international rules. He told CoinDesk that in order to meet demand in Iran for outside investment, he will work with a diverse group of professionals to ensure his firm is compliant with both US and EU sanctions positions. ""We have a process that we are working on,"" said Johansson, ""which we will have audited and reviewed by regulators to make sure that we comply with anti-money laundering directives, with counter-terrorist financing directives, and also sanctions in general."" Now that Johansson’s firm has been incorporated, he wants to use bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to help Iranian companies overcome similar obstacles. As mentioned, Brave New World Investments was unable to get an account in Sweden due to concerns described by Johansson that the local banks might perceive the account as a violation of their agreements with US business interests. Similarly, for four years, interbank messaging platform Swift had cut all ties with banks in Iran. While some of those restrictions were lifted in January 2016 and international credit cards have been slowly entering the market, many sanctioned banks remain blocked. ""The sanctions have impacted both economically, and in a humanitarian sense,"" said Johansson. ""Economically, they have been cut off from the international banking community."" Johansson sees Sweden's willingness to accept a bitcoin account in lieu of a bank account as evidence of an emerging sector of companies that are unable to obtain bank accounts, but are doing everything from paying rent, buying copy machines and providing services using bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

                            Bitcoin's Latest Scaling Twist: Support is Building for a UASF                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-latest-scaling-twist-support-building-uasf/,"It seems to be one thing after another for bitcoin. Amid the long-standing debate, one well-known bitcoin developer recently posted a note to the project's mailing list alleging a major mining entity is prolonging the debate over scaling because it would accidentally wipe out a technical advantage that gives it an upperhand over other miners. It's unclear his claims are true. Even supporters admit there isn't hard evidence, and many others are skeptical. Despite this, many in the community think there's enough circumstantial evidence to back it up, and a grassroots movement is growing in the hopes of pushing through the change that miners are now being accused of blocking. Normally, miners are the ones that are tasked with pushing through such a fix. But because of this roadblock, some in the bitcoin community are calling for a different (more experimental, yet older) method of making a change to bitcoin based on support of the so-called ""economic majority"", instead of miner support. The change is known as a ""user-activated soft fork"", or a UASF. Coinkite CEO and co-founder Rodolfo Novak, an advocate for the nascent movement, said it aims to correct perceived inequities that have so far dominated the years-long scaling discussion. He told CoinDesk: And, support appears to be growing. There's a website and a Twitter. There are UASF hats. Though the code isn't safe to run yet, some volunteers running nodes are now flagging support with their nodes. Volunteers who run nodes can signal their support by adding a line to their node configuration file. Since the allegations were made last Wednesday, node support for the change has grown to 4.8%, or by about six times. But, since the code isn't ready yet, and users are just showing support, does it really mean anything? ""On a technical level, signaling it that way does absolutely nothing, it does however help the case on a social level and prevents users from running an outdated version of the code when enforcing starts,"" developer Damian Mee argued. Beyond just gauging users' support, some unidentified developers are allegedly testing and reviewing the reference implementation put forward by the pseudonymous shaolinfry in the proposal BIP 148. But, so far they're secretive about it, and are waiting to see if people flag support for the change or not. (Though, one contributor delivered a reddit AMA on Monday.) That said, there's a long been back and forth on the topic of this metric because node counts are easy to spoof. For example, one entity can spin up a bunch of nodes in a data center in a sybil attack, as it's formally known. So, simple node count might not be the best indicator. Due to how a UASF works, it could be necessary to have explicit support from the ""economic majority,"" or exchanges, wallets, and other bitcoin economic players. And, support from key economic players is so far at about 6% since the BIP was put out on March 12th (by one metric), admittedly sparse. Though, others are allegedly on the way, many are starting to announce their company's support via reddit. However, Novak pointed out that a sizable percentage of bitcoin nodes are running Bitcoin Core, and the versions with SegWit, which he thinks is a good indicator that the fuzzily-defined ""economic majority"" supports SegWit, and thus a UASF version of it. This is perhaps notable given that the code is backwards-compatible, so the 80% of nodes that are currently ready for SegWit, would also be ready for the change. Given this, Novak said he's ""very optimistic"" the plan to scale the network could ultimately work. Again, there’s while there's a reference code implementation, it hasn't been fully tested and reviewed yet. The original activation date for SegWit was put at October 1st, 2017, but shaolinfry, recently moved it up to 1st August, meaning, if the community supports the proposal, that miners need to signal support for SegWit by that date, or they will fork off the network would need to upgrade. If it sounds dangerous or as if the idea is being rushed along, many believe it is. It's highly possible that the current aura of confidence in the proposal is the result of high tensions. Others are proceeding more cautiously, as shown in one bitcoin developer chatroom. ""I'd say we want [it], if we think there is community support,"" said lead Bitcoin Core maintainer Wladimir van der Laan, when asked if developers should consider coding up Maxwell's suggested BIP. Bitcoin Core contributor Pieter Wuille mentioned that it's ""complicated"" to determine when that threshold is met. ""Whether that BIP is the best solution to that is indeed open, indeed makes sense for the dust to settle on that, though it may still make sense to have actual code,"" Van der Laan added later. In the mailing list thread where he outlined his allegations against the miner in question, Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell proposed using the method, but agreed that going through with it would depend on the level of support from the community. Yet another development is that some developers are calling for a UASF on litecoin, a smaller blockchain by market cap, as both a way to get it on SegWit, and as a way to ""test"" how a UASF would pan out should it prove to be as divisive as other proposals. But like past attempts to scale bitcoin, it remains to be seen if cooler heads, or strong passions, will prevail. USAF hat image via Twitter

According to Bloomberg, senior Russian officials including Deputy Minister of Finance Alexey Moiseev and representatives from the Bank of Russia (the country’s central bank) are developing a position on bitcoin and digital currencies as part of a bid to cut money laundering risks. Moiseev reportedly indicated that the government wants access to information about transaction parties, and that services in Russia handling digital currency payments would be required to collect and submit that data. He told the news source: While Russia’s final position remains to be seen, past developments have suggested a move toward a softer stance on the technology. Back in 2015, the government initially proposed steep fines on the use or creation of digital currencies. Those proposed penalties were later beefed up in an amended draft later the same year. However, last August, officials reportedly backed away from a more punitive approach soon after Moiseev himself indicated that Russia could recognize bitcoin as a kind of foreign currency.

                            Should I Do It? 30,000 Bitcoins and One Big Auction                        ",Adam Draper,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-milestones-adam-draper-silk-road-auction/,"Adam Draper is the founder and managing director of San Mateo-based venture capital firm Boost VC, one of bitcoin and blockchain's earliest and most active incubators. To date, Boost VC has backed more than bitcoin 50 companies at the seed level or above. In this entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Draper gives an overview of 1st July, 2014, the day his father Tim Draper purchased nearly 30,000 bitcoins in the US government's first-ever bitcoin auction.  ""So, should I do it?"" It's 1st July, 2014, and I'm driving to work. I was turning onto El Camino when I got the call from my dad. ""I'm about to press the button to send in my bid,"" he said. The week would prove an interesting one in history. Justin Trudeau was sworn in as Canada's prime minister, Chris Stapleton raked in CMAs and it also happened to be the week the US Marshals Service auctioned off 30,000 bitcoins. *** Up to that point our industry had a torrid history of scandal and skepticism. The general masses had only heard that large sums of money had been stolen from bitcoin exchanges or that everyone buys illegal drugs with bitcoin. In fact, the reason that the US Marshals office had the bitcoin was because Ross Ulbricht (aka 'Dread Pirate Roberts') had been captured and proclaimed the leader of the Silk Road, a startup focused on the illegal sale of goods online. For a while, it was the eBay of buying drugs, guns and hitmen, and the currency used in this anonymous marketplace was the ever-reliable bitcoin. That's the stigma that stuck to the technology (and that still sticks to this day), and it was everywhere at the time. I remember being on a panel with my dad [Tim Draper] and grandpa [Bill Draper] in early 2015, in front of hundreds of people. It was the first time we had done a panel where we each talked about our lives as venture capitalists. When it was my turn to speak, the only thing I said was ""bitcoin"", and as I started to explain why, my grandpa turned and cracked a joke: ""Well Adam, don't be the first Draper to go to jail."" Even my grandfather, the most prescient man I have ever known, had a tilted perspective of the bitcoin world. (He also obviously didn't know about my trip to Tijuana, Mexico, in college either). *** The sale of the US Marshal bitcoin had the potential to be a major shift in public sentiment depending on the outcome. This was a government-funded institution that had confiscated digital currency and was auctioning it off in return for cash. This was the government recognizing the validity of bitcoin and using it to generate its own revenue. If it was only used, or had value for illegal goods, the US Marshals Service wouldn't touch it, no government agency would take a stack of confiscated cocaine and publicly auction it off to the highest bidder. ""So, should I do it? I'm about to press the button."" I took a breath and responded: He said ""OK"", and hung up. *** Looking back, I probably should have hesitated. I didn't know it at the time, but he was bidding millions to win the whole amount. I assumed he was only bidding for a portion... The next day I walked into my office, and my co-founder Brayton Williams said, ""Did you hear? All the bitcoin in the auction went to a single person."" I thought to myself, ""Dad… what did you do?!"" I went upstairs (we work in the same building in San Mateo) and I walked in on an incredible moment. The Vaurum team was in the room, Avish Bhama and Sean Lavine, my dad and my brother were all there. I sat down on the couch looking out to my dad's desk and the open window, he was on the phone with someone.  ""Hey you made it just in time! We are transferring the bitcoin into my wallet!"" he said, my dad’s infinite enthusiasm even more palpable than normal. I remember looking around and having a feeling of history come over me. I had been working in the digital currency world for 18 months at this point, and I knew that when the history of bitcoin was written, this moment was going to be one of those moments that was spoken about and potentially debated. That's why what happened next is comical... *** So, my dad was on the phone with the US Marshals, who were going to send this super advanced new type of currency over the internet to my dad's wallet. But because it was millions of dollars at stake, they were verbally confirming and reconfirming the wallet addresses. ""Lowercase Z, seven, capital X, four, five…."" ""Wait… Lowercase C? or Z?"" ""Z as in Zebra."" ""OK, continue."" It was analogous to the 'easy' user experience that bitcoin has always had a problem with. They repeated this process four times before they decided that they were sure the address was correct. ""OK confirmed,"" my dad said. You could hear the voice on the other end say, ""OK, sent."" And nothing happened. Everyone justified this. They said, 'Well it takes 10 minutes for a confirmation on the blockchain to happen...' Ten minutes went by… nothing. There were 30,000 bitcoin going somewhere, but it didn’t feel like they were going to the wallet address it was supposed to go to. Twenty minutes pass. Nothing. Everyone was getting nervous. Thirty minutes pass. Nothing. I left the room just as everyone started to get a little worried. Sure, it was a historic moment, but I was already a half hour late for my next meeting... *** Flash forward, and it took an hour to confirm. AN HOUR!!! (It turns out that the US Marshal didn't give the miners a fee for the transaction, so it wasn't a priority on the network). But the transaction did go through, and my dad and the US Marshals Service successfully completed a bitcoin transaction that got put into the record books. And the headlines read: ""Venture Capitalist Steve Draper Wins Bitcoin Auction."" The first article I read called my dad 'Steve'. Hilarious. ""Tim Draper Wins Silk Road Auction"" was the common title used. Now, think about what just happened. The US government successfully sold 30,000 bitcoins. Not only that, but a professional investor had won all of them, and not a random professional investor, but a third-generation venture capitalist who had earned respect by being one of the best VCs ever for backing startups like Skype, Baidu and Hotmail. That is what the world read that day in The Wall Street Journal, Forbes and The New York Times. The bitcoin community needed a catalyst to change perception, and I believe my dad created it.

According to the Times of India, an officer for the Indian Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) is alleged to helped steal more than 400 bitcoins originally confiscated during a 2015 seizure. Specifically, investigator Satyendra Kumar Singh is said to have been accused of unfreezing those funds at the behest of one of those arrested. The media source claimed that it was the first such case in India – though the cryptocurrency world is no stranger to rogue agents siphoning bitcoins obtained during criminal investigations. The NCB reportedly alleged that Singh consulted with Deepak Manguikya, one of the accused drug dealers, after he was released on bail in 2016. In July 2016, Singh then helped Manguikya forge documents which would allow for the unfreezing of the accounts where the bitcoins were stored. After being unfrozen, the accounts were emptied and liquidated with Singh allegedly receiving 50% of the proceeds. Officials noticed the missing coins while working on a report regarding the status of the seized funds. Subsequently, the NCB moved to suspend and arrest Singh, and an investigation into his role in the heist is said to be ongoing. Image via Shutterstock

                            Mirai, The Infamous Internet of Things Army, Can Now Mine Bitcoin                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/mirai-infamous-internet-things-army-can-now-mine-bitcoin/,"Remember that Internet of Things botnet? The one known for temporarily shutting down a number of the world's largest websites last autumn? Well, a newer version has been detected, but as well as being able to issue DDoS attacks and the like, it's equipped to mine bitcoin. In the digital age, it's possible for hackers to infect and take control of insecure Internet of Things (IoT) devices, say, toasters, cameras or other web-connected devices. They can then bundle them together into a botnet, using their combined capacity to shoot spam at websites or internet structures, slowing them down or sending them offline. That's what happened in a series of attacks in the fall, using the malware dubbed Mirai. The software was open-sourced soon after – much to the dismay of security engineers – and, since then, different strains iterating on the first version of the botnet have cropped up with added abilities. One strain, known as ELF Linux/Mirai, has now been detected mining bitcoin for a few days, according to research from IBM X-Force, the Big Blue's cybersecurity research wing. It seems some unknown hacker (or hackers) is experimenting with using the power accumulated from IoT devices to mine the digital currency and possibly make some cash. This could be an omen for future IoT botnet use cases, argued Dave McMillen, IBM Managed Security Services senior threat researcher and author of the report. McMillen told CoinDesk: The researcher noted, however, that, the botnet didn't appear to successfully mine any bitcoin. The security team see it more like a peek at a down-the-road possibility. So, what happened, and how did IBM spot the mining component of the botnet? McMillen explained, saying: The security team saw traffic related to an ELF 64-bit binary file., which the report describes as beginning as a ""blip"", which grew in volume by 50%, but had fizzled out by day eight. The team ""dissected"" the binary to discover that the Linux version of the malware is similar to the more typical Windows version. ""It was detected as a slave miner by multiple tools, however we are still investigating other properties of the variant,"" McMillen added. While there are now many variants of the botnet, ELF Linux/Mirai has extra abilities in that it can execute 'SQL injection' (a notorious way to take control of databases) and execute so called 'brute force' attacks. But, the Linux version has an extra add-on – the bitcoin miner component (which you can see online here). IBM speculates in the report that the botnet creators may be looking for a way to make bitcoin mining with compromised IoT devices a lucrative venture. ""Realizing the power of Mirai to infect thousands of machines at a time, there is a possibility that the bitcoin miners could work together in tandem as one large miner consortium. We haven't yet determined that capability, but found it to be an interesting yet concerning possibility,"" a blog post explains, adding: Although this idea is admittedly speculative, the report points to the fact that bitcoin has been used for other cybercrimes – such with ransomware, which encrypts all of a user's computer data with a demand for payment – because it's decentralized and is perceived as a more privacy-enhancing currency. The tech can have more beneficial uses cases, though. For example, one company recently revealed aims to build a bitcoin botnet to help secure IoT devices, combining the cryptocurrency with technology also has the potential for less beneficial online activities. So, how can users protect their internet-connected toasters from being enlisted as a bitcoin mining slave? The Mirai malware exploits a surprisingly simple attack vector. The problem is that many IoT devices come with pre-installed passwords. And, since many users never change them, all an attacker needs to do is find the default password to 'hack' into the devices. McMillen’s advice is for users to change those passwords. Though, he said that he hopes that IoT companies are beginning to tackle the problem, too. He concluded: Army computer via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Tops 3-Week High As Price Inches Upward                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-3-week-high-inch-upward/," In the face of continued division over its technical roadmap, the price of bitcoin has responded by creeping closer to all-time highs. Following positive sessions over the weekend, the price of bitcoin hit a high of $1,219 to start Monday's session, reaching a total the market hadn't seen since late March. At press time, the price of bitcoin was trading at $1,216, slightly below that figure. The three-week high observed is the highest figure since 16th March, when bitcoin hit a high of $1,260 amid a period of heavy volatility. (The day's low was $1,132, a differential of more than $100 for that day's trading). Yet, indicators suggest it's not yet clear exactly which direction the bitcoin price is heading. On Friday, for example, bitcoin faced heavy resistance at the $1,200 level and struggled to move upward. This was despite 80% of the market entering buy orders at 20:00 UTC, according to data from BFXdata, a service that tracks trading activity on Bitfinex. Today, that indecision seems apparent once again, as 24-hour trades favored buy orders 61% to 39%, while 1-hour order book activity favored sellers 56% to 44%. The price increase further comes amid a decline in exchange-traded bitcoin volume from peaks observed in the wake of a US regulator's decision to reject a retail investment product focused on the technology in mid-March. Roughly 100,000 bitcoins have been traded in the last 24 hours, with Bitfinex, OKCoin and Kraken observing the most activity during this span. Measuring tape image via Shutterstock

                            How Deloitte's Bitcoin Bistro Was Built                        ",Aaron Stanley,https://www.coindesk.com/how-deloitte-bitcoin-bistro-built/,"While Deloitte has long been an advisor on blockchain and cryptocurrencies, it took a step toward to practicing what it preaches earlier this month. After installing a bitcoin ATM in its Toronto office last fall, the consulting giant is now accepting bitcoin payments at a restaurant in its office complex – providing a hands-on opportunity for patrons to experience bitcoin. Iliana Oris Valiente, strategy leader at Rubix by Deloitte, explained that such first-hand experiences are instrumental toward educating people about the greater potential underlying blockchain technology. Despite her firm's focus on distributed ledger applications, she said that understanding the technology in any of its many variations often starts with a walk through its historical origins. She told CoinDesk: ""It's very difficult to skip over that part of the historic line and say, 'Oh by the way, now we’re going to talk to you about this really complicated distributed ledger technology',"" she continued. With the bitcoin ATM becoming more popular with clients and employees, Oris Valiente said it was logical for her firm to look for other ways to expand on its support for the digital currency. ""But the question we often received was, 'So, where do I use the bitcoins that I've acquired?'"" she said, adding: With this lightbulb lit, Deloitte teamed up with Benchmark Hospitality (which operates Bistro 1858 inside Deloitte’s Toronto complex) and bitcoin processor BitPay to kick off the concept. The idea was that users could download a wallet, purchase bitcoin from the ATM and then buy a meal from the bistro – with the end result being that they could see the changes to their balance reflected immediately. Benchmark initially viewed the opportunity as a chance to cut costs and test out a new technology, but the appeal has expanded much more widely. ""We've had a positive reaction from the bistro staff,"" said Oris Valiente. ""They've just said: 'This is flat out cool.'"" For Deloitte, the initiative has served as a means to inform even more people about bitcoin and blockchain, while generating more organic interest in the subject internally. ""We have a lot of our internal employees who are excited to get their first bitcoin wallet, buy their first fraction of a bitcoin and perhaps invite their clients in and have a conversation about what this technology means,"" she said. But Deloitte is quick to concede that rolling out such an endeavor – as straightforward as it may seem – is far from an easy task. There were a plethora of financial and technological hurdles to overcome. These included determining how Bistro 1858 would handle end-of-shift reconciliations, calculating the implementation costs and deciding which payment provider would be the best fit. At the end of the day, Oris Valiente explained that introducing the new payments system was ultimately a change management exercise. While simple in aim, it involved retraining management and front-line staff, along with communicating to all stakeholders why the exercise was being undertaken in the first place. ""I think those conversations, and trying to understand what motivates all of the parties and how we address all of their needs, that was probably the most time-consuming aspect,"" she said. However, she argued that the exercise has been useful in helping to explain that blockchain solutions are similar to other types of enterprise applications: While the nuts and bolts get fundamentally reworked, the experience for the end-user oftentimes remains unchanged. ""The user experience is pretty straightforward; what's changed is the complex back-end. That story is actually in parallel to what we often see when we develop enterprise applications,"" she said. Oris Valiente also emphasized that the exercise has been instrumental in helping to facilitate the flow of creative juices internally. ""A lot of the use cases that we’re working on today could not have been possible if it were a small group of people sitting in a board room talking to one another,"" she said, adding: Bistro 1858 image via Deloitte

                            The Hidden History of Bitcoin Unlimited                        ",Paul Elliot-Ennis & Rachel-Rose O'Leary,https://www.coindesk.com/hidden-history-bitcoin-unlimited/,"Paul Elliot-Ennis is a lecturer and assistant professor in management information systems in the College of Business, University College Dublin, while Rachel-Rose O'Leary is an artist and writer researching cryptographic systems.  In this guest feature, Elliot-Ennis and O'Leary retrace the history of Bitcoin Unlimited, a bitcoin implementation seeking to become the dominant software on the network through a solution to the network's longstanding scaling debate. In the midst of the scaling debate, it can be difficult to uncover the genealogical roots of the various competing projects. The internet operates at a clip that renders analysis of how an open-source project emerged closer to detective work than it should be. Add into the mix rumors, innuendo and disinformation and one really has their work cut out for them. In certain cases, personalities might transcend the murk and become quasi-official figures, as evident in the proselytizing of Andreas Antonopoulos, the 'let the code speak for itself' quietism of Pieter Wuille, or the informed whimsy of Samson Mow. However, it is not always the case that important figures within the cryptocurrency ecosystem are visible at all, even when their actions have significant impact on the network. This is especially true with the case of Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) where, in contrast to the well-known developers associated with Bitcoin Classic (Gavin Andresen) and Bitcoin XT (Mike Hearn), the key developers of BU are not familiar names. A little bit of history, then, would not be remiss in such an atmosphere  – if for nothing more than to make clear that, in the end, the two sides of the debate are populated by pretty normal folk who are just happy to disagree on a pretty arcane set of ideas, albeit ideas with expensive repercussions. Like most open-source projects, Bitcoin Unlimited is broadly a virtual community consisting of a motley crew of developers, writers, generalists and onlookers. They are invariably people already involved with bitcoin for many years, and BU arose primarily from a single thread on Bitcoin Talk known as ""Gold Collapsing Bitcoin Up"". Like numerous such threads, debates were often heated, quite personalized, and partisan. There are certain key figures at the time who seemed to have had a real impact on giving this new community a degree of confidence to expand beyond Core. Dr Peter Rizun was clearly a significant voice and looks to have provided much of the intellectual weight behind BU's theoretical commitments, such as how transaction fees would occur within a network without a block size limit. Rizun's ideas are effectively a response to the possibility of removing the current limit of 1MB as expressed in BIP 101 (an improvement proposal authored by Gavin Andresen) that proposed raising the block size limit to 8MB and implementing a biannual doubling thereafter in order to deal with the problem of full blocks and expensive transaction fees. BIP 101 was never adopted, and has its own history within earlier scaling debates. However, it did inspire participants in the ""Gold Collapsing Bitcoin Up"" thread to seek out new solutions. The BU operation played out on that thread through the summer of 2015, gathering pace as the bitcoin blockchain began to feature ever higher fees. According to Rizun, the four-week transactional average recorded on June 2015 had grown 376 times greater than was seen in September 2010. Bitcoin Magazine reported tens of thousands of unconfirmed transactions as the block size strained to accommodate network usage. A little later, a post by Rizun in July 2015 noticed the average block size had bloated to 70% capacity and was continuing to surge. Discussion on Bitcoin Talk escalated, but the thread was soon locked in what the BU community read as a form of censorship. The perceived villain of the piece here was Bitcoin Talk administrator Theymos and the same accusation from BU members would carry over to r/bitcoin, another online platform also administrated by Theymos. Unlimited supporters turned to r/btc that, of course, Core supporters have tended to consider heavily censored, resulting in a kind of intellectual split that, whatever the technical details, is riven with what can appear to the outsider as quasi-conspiratorial paranoia. The takeaway is that, once untethered from the perceived pro-Core climate of Theymos-dominated media, Bitcoin Unlimited set out on its own path, allowing for a period of off-grid development that would quietly emerge just as Core supporters assumed Segregated Witness (SegWit) would be implemented. This essentially meant that when a form of competition did emerge, Bitcoin Core was blindsided and broadly unprepared. This does not mean they were technically not ready, but rather they had overlooked two subtle developments: miners were not entirely convinced by SegWit, and not everybody completely accepted that it was the obvious solution. This set up the scene for an ideological confrontation. On the BU forums, the idea of a new bitcoin software did not occur immediately. Such a task requires a dedicated developer or development team, but it is not until Andrew Stone (theZerg) began to posit the idea an alternative client that there was real movement. Here it is actually BIP 100 (authored by Jeff Garzik and others) that is most influential, since it explicitly puts the decision about removing the block size limit into the hands of the miners through a voting process. Those who have been following the debate will know that a large amount of the current discussion centers on the role of miners, most often a core of Chinese pools, and to what extent that should be influencing the future direction of bitcoin. Figures involved with these pools, such as Jihan Wu, have taken on almost a shadowy status, maligned agents looking to stall the adoption of SegWit in order to maintain their stranglehold on transaction fees. No doubt there is some truth to the claims of self-interest; nobody is surely naive enough to think otherwise. However, the salient aspect for Bitcoin Unlimited is that having the miners on-side meant having a voice. If bitcoin can be read, and no doubt many will have other interpretations, as a set of influential blocs, not always in competition, then the two most influential voices are surely those of the Core development team (technical credentials) and the large Chinese mining pools (hash rate credentials). The current scaling debate only really kicks off when it becomes clear that, not only are many of the major pools not supporting SegWit, but they are actually signaling for Bitcoin Unlimited. This is thought by many as risking a hard fork of the network into rival blockchains, given how serious the divisions between Core and Unlimited are. The undercurrent to all this are the socio-economic arguments underlying Bitcoin Unlimited. In Peter Rizun’s original BU white paper, we first encounter a now semi-familiar concept in emergent consensus (EC). EC maintains that, given the economic incentive of remaining on the same chain, miners will reconfigure their block size to match the majority of the network. Notably, the white paper includes a section that is explicitly about values, not just technical themes, and they can be summarized as focused on speedy transactions (bitcoin as cash, not gold), on ensuring low fees and being censorship-resistant. It is perhaps this approach that first caught the attention of noted bitcoin investor Roger Ver, who told us: Ver almost certainly must have come across it browsing those subreddits sympathetic to Classic and XT, but one can easily see why he found BU appealing. An outspoken investor, he has been consistently vocal about his vision of bitcoin as principally a payment system, and one that is, as he told us, ""useful as money"". This economically minded vision, in the sense of insisting on bitcoin's core function as facilitating quick-and-easy transactions, is also evident with Bitcoin Unlimited’s lead developer, Andrew Stone. He said: In the current climate, it is almost impossible to simply relay the motivations behind such projects by retroactively viewing them through current debates. However, even a cursory glance at the early inception of Bitcoin Unlimited mostly appears to be a sincere attempt to halt what that community views as a deviation from bitcoin's original vision, quite often expressed as 'Satoshi's vision'. For BU, this can be broadly summarized as the primacy of wide-scale adoption, facilitated by transaction speed and the necessity for consensus rule across the network. If Emergent Consensus functions as anticipated, we will witness a synchronized adaptation of the network towards increased block size, in a movement that has been compared to a flock of birds working in harmony. While criticism from Core suggests that this would further centralize the network, Andrew Stone anticipates that, if large mining pools choose to dominate the network with high difficulty blocks, smaller pools will simply switch to an alternate chain, effectively facilitating two economic niches. The ideological split between what it means to be decentralized currency at the level of practice pivots around differing conceptions of control. For BU, the block size limit is locus of an ideological game, where the system can only remain decentralized if this is distributed across nodes and miners. For them, the actions of Core enforce a hierarchical structure that contradict the promise of a decentralized cryptocurrency based entirely on technical adeptness. Whatever happens next will almost certainly confirm the suspicions of one side about the other. If SegWit is adopted, adding a hitherto unforeseen degree of technical complexity to the network, then we enter a phase that confirms wide trust across the entire bitcoin community in the vision of the Core team. If, however, the miners hold out and Unlimited results in a fork, whether now or later (once again possibly blindsiding Core), then we will have to face an ideological schism that asks us to speculate on what precisely we believe bitcoin to be. What Bitcoin Unlimited has brought to light is precisely two competing conceptions over the essence of this entire project, and our worry is precisely this: because the debate has become so polarized, it has become increasingly difficult to communicate across the divide. If bitcoin can be partially understood as a consensus protocol, we might soon have to get better at doing just that. Hidden safe image via Shutterstock

                            The 'Big Block' Bitcoin Movement is Embracing Bcoin                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/big-block-bitcoin-movement-embracing-bcoin/,"Over the course of bitcoin's two-year scaling debate, a few major alternatives have grown to challenge the network's most popular and longest-running software, Bitcoin Core. Among the more notable efforts have been Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, which prioritized support larger block sizes as a method to support more transactions. However, a side effect of their ambitious aims was that network users would need switch implementations to enact the changes, and not everyone has wanted to do so. The development exposes one of the more curious aspects of the scaling debate, as alternative solutions have needed to propose both a technical change – and build their own developer team – as part of their bids to put forth differing ideas. One of the main criticisms of Bitcoin Unlimited, one recently popular alternative that allows miners and users to flag support for the block size they want, is that the code is buggy – or, at least, not yet mature. For example, in March, attackers were able to exploited two such bugs, causing most of the network nodes running the software to temporarily shut down each time. In this light, the emergence of an implementation called 'Bcoin' (built by bitcoin startup Purse) to the debate could be a notable development in the scaling saga. The software project got a recent boost this week when it introduced its own take on an old scaling idea, 'extension blocks' (or 'e-blocks'), which the company painted as a way for getting around today's block-size standstill. The idea is controversial, as evidenced by complex technical discussion following the announcement, with some developers arguing that e-blocks would be an insecure addition. Still, e-blocks have still seen a strong showing of support, in large part due to the perceived proficiency of its team. And, notably, Bitcoin Unlimited supporters have so far had favorable things to say about the project. Haipo Yang, chief executive of mining firm ViaBTC, for instance, told CoinDesk that he supports Purse's concept and the Bcoin team. Yang said: Overall, the argument is developing that Bcoin, an alternative Node.js implementation that launched in September, boasts a stronger technical team than that of Bitcoin Unlimited and other so-called 'big block' teams. Purse CTO and Bcoin developer Christopher Jeffrey, for example, has been praised for architecting the software, as well as an in-progress Lightning implementation called Plasma that could be layered on top. Meanwhile, Joseph Poon, Lightning Network co-creator, helped author the specification for the Bcoin implementation’s recently introduced flagship tech. One example of trust in the competence of the team, supporters argue, is that mining pool BTC.com has already mined one block while running the software in March – allegedly a first for a client not based on bitcoin's original code implementation. Purse has released a specification draft and reference implementation code that implements extension blocks on top of Bcoin. That's not to say that Bcoin wants to offer a replacement for Bitcoin Core, as has been suggested for other implementations. When first introduced, it was described by the company as a bitcoin alternative with cleaner code that could co-exist alongside other software versions. Despite Yang's confidence, however, not all Bitcoin Unlimited supporters are going all in on extension blocks. Former Bitcoin Foundation board member Olivier Janssens, for example, criticized the solution for its complexities, telling CoinDesk Bcoin's idea was ""way too complicated"". ""People need to get over their fear of hard forks,"" he said. Still, many are saying positive things about the solution, even if they're possibly more focused on other scaling options. ""I like extension blocks, but I think there is almost no risk from making the actual blocks bigger, too,"" bitcoin investor and Bitcoin.com operator Roger Ver, one of the most vocal advocates for Bitcoin Core alternatives, told CoinDesk. Bitcoin Unlimited developer David Jerry Chan went so far as to compare the tech favorably to other available solutions. ""I see the proposal as a reasonable and better alternative than SegWit,"" he said. Chan went on to say that Bitcoin Unlimited developers are still discussing the proposal, and there's no ""official opinion"" from the team as yet. As far as potential setbacks go, however, one of the criticisms of Bcoin is that it needs time to review, no matter the merits of its team. (SegWit, for example, was reviewed and tested for roughly a year before release.) On the other hand, Purse CEO Andrew Lee has argued that the Bcoin code is already live, so it could take less time to review. Indeed, according to the technology announcement, the next steps are to deploy it on the bitcoin test network, get further review, and wrap up the specification. Yang agreed, concluding: Pencils image via Shutterstock

In a new interview with Canaan Creative, maker of the Avalon chip series, spokesperson Steven Mosher said the company is willing to take the first step to make its practices more open, arguing accusations levied against fellow chip maker Bitmain have exposed an issue that those in the industry now need to correct. The comments come during a time of deep division in the community about assertions made by Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell in a reddit post last night. Unpacked further in our CoinDesk explainer, the resulting controversy has rekindled bitcoin's scaling debate, and unearthed new ethical questions about how miners should be expected to engage with the bitcoin blockchain. Mosher, who heads the company's sales and marketing outside of mainland China, said that regardless of whether the allegations prove true, it's the ""perception"" that miners may be harmful to the network that is dangerous. Mosher told CoinDesk: Mosher went on to address what he acknowledged was the business necessity that miners face the issue, given the fact that bitcoin's developer community has shown an increasing willingness to consider protocol changes that would reduce the power – or even eliminate the need for miners altogether. Already, other blockchain networks are in the midst of such protocol changes, as ethereum plans to switch to a new consensus algorithm, proof-of-stake, designed specifically to eliminate the type of hardware mining seen in bitcoin. At the same time, Mosher sidestepped the nuances of the debate, stating that while this would likely spark a debate about the forensics of mining chips and what can be achieved, Canaan prefers to stay out of such speculation. ""People shouldn't process this on anecdote. There's going to be a forensic look at it, let it be a transparent look at it,"" he said. However, Mosher did address the technique at the heart of the controversy, the use of a patented technology called AsicBoost in an attempt to optimize mining returns. ""Do we support AsicBoost? The answer is no,"" Mosher said. Mosher continued, stating that he would like for major mining hardware providers to meet as part of an effort to make more information public about their practices. ""Standing up and recounting the past, recounting Hong Kong or said what, or who called who a dipshit, it's time for the grown-ups to do what we know how to do,"" he said, adding: Avalon image via CoinDesk Archieve

                            Bitcoin's New Controversy: The AsicBoost Allegations Explained                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-new-controversy-asicboost-allegations-explained/,"Bitcoin is abuzz with fresh controversy following an inflammatory new post by Bitcoin Core developer and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell in which he alleges some miners are engaging in unfair practices that may be harmful to the network. Posted to the bitcoin mailing list last night, the entry asserts that a mining hardware maker is secretly exploiting a previously known weakness in bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm that enables them to mine roughly 20% faster than competitors. The allegation is that this activity is ongoing, and that this has been proven by an analysis conducted on a mining chip. Here's where the intellectual gymnastics begin. Of note is that the technology in use has already been patented by developers Timo Hanke and Sergio Demian Lerner in a scheme called ""AsicBoost"" for which a patent was filed in November 2014. Maxwell contends that someone has discovered what he called a ""covert"" version of the technology used in a mining chip. He did not state who conducted the analysis, whether him or a separate party. Taking a step further into speculation, the inference of the post is that Segregated Witness, a scaling solution developed and proposed by the Bitcoin Core team, would render the covert version of AsicBoost discovered obsolete, hurting the bottom lines of any miners using the workaround. As such, the statement has stoked controversy in bitcoin's long-simmering scaling debate in that the allegation that the miner engaged in the practice is China-based Bitmain – one of the industry’s largest providers of mining equipment. (Bitmain has a separate patent for the AsicBoost technology in China). The assertion is that Bitmain is not only blocking a technical solution favored by the Core developers (through its support of alternative development teams), but doing so because it would enhance its profitability at the expense of users. In statements, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu has vehemently denied that the company is using the AsicBoost workaround on the bitcoin blockchain. ""There is no relationship between SegWit and AsicBoost,"" Wu told CoinDesk. Bitmain released a statement on Thursday, adding that they tested AsicBoost, but they never used it in a real mining capacity, and further pointed to an agreement where they expressed support for SegWit in the past. Even those involved in the debate acknowledged that, given present information, it remains difficult to prove whether the allegations are true. Former COO of bitcoin mining firm BTCC, Samson Mow, told CoinDesk that the post confirms rumors that have been floating around for some time, though he did not offer any new evidence in the conversation. Mow told CoinDesk: First things first, it may be beneficial to understand the specific mining technique at the center of the allegations. In short, AsicBoost is best described as a ""mathematical trick."" Instead of taking a huge amount of computation, miners can use the technique to whittle down their choices of potential hashes that enable them to solve a puzzle and claim bitcoin's rewards. These mathematical tricks can lead to an increase in mining profitability by boosting key mining hardware profitability ratios. For example, a primary measurement of mining profitability is the amount of money earned in gigahashes per second (GH/s). This is most often measured in USD per Gh/s. The other measure of hardware profitability involves determining energy consumption, commonly measured in Joules, and dividing that by the hashing speed. This is the Joule per Gh/s. The creators of the technology claim these key ratios are improved by roughly 20% thanks to AsicBoost. According to mining firm representatives, the technique has been known for some time, though it is largely out of use through a combination of patent protection and industry standards that aren't enforced by any body or organization. Going back to Maxwell's original post, what's being speculated is that the company in question, allegedly Bitmain, isn't using AsicBoost exactly. Rather, the mining chip in is said to implement another version of the idea whereby it is implemented in the hardware. Further, it is argued that Segregated Witness would, as a bi-product of its code, make this specific technique obsolete. Should this be correct, and should the mining chip maker be implementing the chip widely, it's argued that they may have a business interest in blocking the software. For mining firms, which produce mining chips on a massive scale, the pace of technological innovation renders hardware obsolete within a period of months. It is argued that such a recall could be potentially devastating, adding pressures to the scaling argument. At the center of the issue is whether the specific technology use represents a natural desire for a competitive advantage, and whether miners can be working ""against the network"" if no rule prevents them from engaging in that activity. For example, there is no rule that currently prevents use of the AsicBoost design, meaning that miners have more of an unspoken agreement to refrain from using the technique on the basis it is ""bad"" for the network. As explained by an executive at one of the world’s largest mining firms, who wished to speak on privacy citing business concerns, the practice is widely known, and has little impact on their operations. ""They operate differently, but that I think it is normal. Jihan [Wu] said it is the freedom given by protocol so they can do it,"" he said. Mow noted that the technique isn't ""kosher"" among miners, as it essentially enables them to try to solve bitcoin's puzzle, without performing any useful work – say, processing transactions. Notably, others don’t think ""attack"" or ""flaw"" is the right term, arguing it’s simply a way for miners to mine more efficiently. IC3 co-director Emin Gün Sirer, for example, asserted in a blog post that there isn't enough public evidence yet to verify Maxwell’s claims. The details of the so-called ""attack"" are rather technical, but in its most basic form it deals with how miners find blocks. To recap the mining process, miners use specially designed equipment to repeatedly hash bitcoin block data (or turn it into a fixed-length scrambled string of letters and numbers) until they hit a particular solution that unlocks bitcoin mining rewards. There’s certain data that miners aren't supposed to know before they calculate hashes so that miners all have to go through the same calculation process, leveling the playing field. The problem, developers claim, is with the hashing algorithm, which miners can exploit in a couple ways. For one, the subject of Maxwell’s post, is a technique that developers call ""merkle grinding."" But, Maxwell claims that some miners found a clever way of finding out more about the data that they expect to find ahead of time. In each block header there's a ""merkle root"" that you can think of as a summary of the transactions bundled in a block. Miners can order transaction data in the merkle tree such that they need to calculate less data. ""If the miner finds multiple candidate root values which have the same final 32-bit then they can use the attack,"" Maxwell writes. This speeds up the process. Essentially, if it goes according to plan, it means occasionally skipping a step. Further, some developers contend that one sign that this technique being used is that some miners have been mining blocks without transactions, making it easier to reorder transactions in the merkle tree. (Bitmain, specifically, has been known to occasionally mine empty blocks). Notably, Timo Hanke, AsicBoost co-inventor and former Cointerra CTO, allege that the argument that AsicBoost is inhibiting Segwit adoption is overplayed. While admitting via Twitter that AsicBoost could potentially be used for purposes that may be detrimental to the network, he said he would not support any Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) that would use the technology to harm bitcoin. AsicBoost co-creater Sergio Lerner noted on Twitter that newly proposed Segwit2MB, an alternative to SegWit, would also prevent miners from continuing to utilize the exploit. Still, the big worry is that this technique is being used to further centralize mining in bitcoin – a problem that developers have been concerned about for a long time – since miners using the faster mining technology could have an advantage over those who don’t. ""Patents conferring large advantage are a problem for bitcoin,"" Blockstream CEO Adam Back said. Further, there's an economic advantage to the attack. A mining pool comprising 50% of the bitcoin mining power could save as much as $100m per year by exploiting the flaw, Maxwell noted. Others have gone on to theorize that, since SegWit somehow fixes the problem, there might be an economic reason that miners do not support the solution. ""If you had a $100m cash cow, and it gets destroyed by a feature, you do everything you can to block it,"" argued developer Alphonse Pace. Maxwell added that this implication is exactly why he began looking into the issue, adding: Alyssa Hertig and Garrett Keirns contributed reporting. Gun lighter for gas-stove via Shutterstock

The company, Bic Camera, sells consumer electronics such as cameras, computers and dishwashers at more than 40 stores domestically. As a result of the integration, customers can now choose to pay with bitcoin for purchases up to a limit of ¥100,000 (around $900). As with other bitcoin payment processors, the POS system developed by bitFlyer will allow the store to accept the digital currency and will immediately convert funds to yen. The stores are then charged a 1% service fee on transactions. BitFlyer claims stores will receive their fiat funds the next day, which it contends is beneficial to smaller stores that need daily cash liquidity to finance operations. The announcement comes during a period of heavy activity for Japan's bitcoin market, which recently saw the recognition of bitcoin as a legal means of payment by the government. Fellow Japanese payment processor and exchange Coincheck also announced a deal yesterday that will put its bitcoin accepting point-of-sale system in up to 260,000 brick and mortar businesses nationwide, an announcement that showcases the new momentum for the local industry.

                            Here Comes the Pickaxe Race: Bitcoin Mining Jumps to GPU                        ",Alex Waters,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-milestones-alex-waters-mining-cpu-gpu/,"An early bitcoin developer and entrepreneur, Alex Waters served as COO and CIO for bitcoin exchange startup BitInstant. Waters would go on to start several bitcoin ventures, and was at the forefront of efforts to boost its regulatory compliance. In the second entry in CoinDesk's 'Bitcoin Milestones' series, Waters discusses the early escalation in what would become an arms race to mine bitcoin, reminiscing on what was lost along the way.   I didn't take the bitcoin white paper seriously when I first read it in late 2009. It wasn't until a few months later that I thought, 'Wow, this is starting to catch on'. I saw someone trade bitcoin for some pizza on the forums. It was awesome, but I didn't really grasp what was happening. At that point, my commitment level was very casual. I remember thinking that if I got some bitcoins, they could maybe pay for a new computer in a couple of years... But bitcoin wasn't like anything I'd seen before. It captured my imagination and I was hopeful that someday it would be discussed outside of forums and IRC chats. *** Soon, that started happening. I put on my hat, met the locals at the saloon and began working on the blockchain. I started panning for bitcoin gold via the default client. At the time, most people generated bitcoins by letting the v0.3 bitcoin client run in the background on their computers (a quaint notion by today's standards). I earned some coins and I loved it. I liked it so much that I spent huge amounts of time researching the mechanics of bitcoin. I immersed myself in understanding the computer science. (This served me better in the long run than any of the mining.) I get asked occasionally if I'm a 'bitcoin millionaire' because I was an early miner, but the answer is no. The early miners I knew traded thousands of coins for the value of a new video game. Most people I spoke with on IRC were mining, but few of the discussions were about the value of a bitcoin. Gavin Andresen, the project's first maintainer, went so far as to give tons of bitcoins away for free to spur the movement. *** Soon, the parameters of mining would change, though. Mining proved to be a dynamic system, with larger unknown actors who had the tools and resources to outpace me. Even after realizing this, I decided that I would keep mining. Mostly because mining was fun. I enjoyed the process of learning and improving — but knew that I couldn't compete. The history of bitcoin mining would go on to progress through several phases. CPU mining took off in 2010 when bitcoin was Slashdotted and a small crowd began mining with the Bitcoin Core client. Then, there was pooled mining. But the big change was the emergence of GPU miners in late 2010 and their total dominance — decimating the CPU mining contingent. (GPU mining would eventually be rendered useless, too, when the first ASICs began to ship). Throughout these movements, there have been a group of people within the bitcoin community called miners. I like to think that I'm part of that group, along with others who have a passion for bitcoin. Although, it's probably more appropriate to label that group 'local miners'. I say local miners because we were a bunch of hobbyist, mom-and-pop operations. We were displaced by large corporate industrial mining. Similar to other markets, economies of scale bore down upon us... *** Looking back, it's easy to say this was just capitalism at work, and it could be argued that it was better for the network as a whole. But I take exception with this idea. Bitcoin mining for me wasn't just about making money (I didn't make much anyway). It was about being part of the bitcoin ecosystem as a contributor, as a voice among many, a sort of crypto-democracy. Mining bitcoins made me feel like I was part of the movement, more than anything else. I was at every step, and was captivated from CPU through ASIC. Somehow I even inherited one of the first two ASICs (shout-out to Yifu Guo, Jeff Garzik, and Charlie Shrem). It stares at me while collecting dust, and reminds me of how I came to where I am today. By creating bitcoins, miners are useful as a bulwark against malfeasance: if bitcoin was a government, the miners made up a branch that prevented others from gaining too much power. For me, one of the biggest moments in bitcoin history was the advent of GPU mining and excitement within the bitcoin community that mining created. It's what kept me fascinated with bitcoin. From working with the core development to working with various bitcoin companies, it all started with mining. GPU mining was when the beat dropped for the bitcoin universe... *** But I still loved that moment when CPU mining was the essence of bitcoin — as Satoshi and many of us saw it. Over time, it was revealed that the system tended toward oligarchy when we moved to GPU. Maybe it was inevitable. I still believe something can be done to take crypto-democracy back. We're mostly a group of people on the internet trying to find and create value together. We know what bitcoin looks like with the current state of centralized mining, and I think we can improve it. Sure the economics of mining have changed. The jump to GPU ensured that. But there's more to mining than money. Be a local miner, bitcoin still needs you.

                            Bitcoin's Broken Record: Why the Scaling Debate Isn't Going Away                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-broken-record-why-the-scaling-debate-isnt-going-away/,"When a bitcoin startup proposed a new way to solve bitcoin's scaling debate this week, it provoked an all-too-familiar response. Conversation escalated on Twitter, lines of argument formed quickly, rumors spread of mass-media deception, and ultimately, a proposal was put forth that perhaps only provided evidence that disagreement among the tech's supporters is the new norm. That's the old script that replayed when bitcoin startup Purse proposed upgrading bitcoin to support so-called 'extension blocks', adding yet another proposal to the now years-long scaling debate that dates back to 2015. As pitched, extension blocks would allow a way for bitcoin users with different needs from the network to live under their own rules – essentially enabling nodes to select their own block size while remaining on the same network. As it only requires a soft fork – a change that wouldn't require all the network's nodes to update – the team framed it as a way to get around bitcoin's current deadlock on how best to scale the digital currency's transaction capacity. In response, some developers pointed to online discussions around similar proposals from months (or even years) ago that revealed the potential security flaws of the plan. Others argued it could take another year to test and deploy the solution, whereas another solution, SegWit, has already been through that process. In other words, not everyone agreed that the new plan was a safe one. This seems to be par for the course for the industry, which saw two similar events take place last week. During this time, the idea the network may put in motion a hard fork – a controversial method of upgrading that could risk splitting bitcoin into two networks – continued to see discussion, though proposals seemed to borrow from a slew of competing ideas. Wang Chun, co-owner and chief administrator of mining pool F2Pool, submitted an idea to the bitcoin mailing list that was unusual since it would not trigger until 2020. With a 32MB block size increase locked in, he argued the bitcoin community could use a soft fork, to change it to a smaller size ahead of the activation date. Chun's idea, however, like Purse's, wasn't really a new one. He said that he brought it up at a scaling meeting in Hong Kong last year, and Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr once issued a similar concept. His letter ended with a warning that those following the debate have also likely heard before: In short, it was another proposal without full support, prompting more than 70 replies, an unusually high number for the mailing list, with multiple variations of 'yes' or 'no'. A few days later, Rootstock (RSK) developer Sergio Demian Lerner posted another hard fork proposal. In a sense, it was different from Chun's in that it wrapped together two changes: SegWit (the solution favored by core developers) and a hard fork to double the block size parameter (an idea often voiced by miners). Though it won some supporters, the reaction was again mixed. Not all developers saw it as a novel idea. Further, because it advocated for a hard fork, many simply weren't willing to entertain the idea. ""These are all hard forks, so they are dead on arrival for any sort of near-term activation, unfortunately,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop told CoinDesk, adding: Fork proposals might not be the only industry event to be in a bit of a loop. Another scaling meeting is coming up in May, one which Digital Currency Group (DCG) co-founder Barry Silbert has confirmed the VC firm will host. However, not everyone is heralding it as a milestone. While at first listed on a possible list of attendees, bitcoin investor and Bitcoin.com operator Roger Ver said that he doesn't plan to attend. ""I agree that there have been plenty of meetings already, and none ended in a lasting agreement,"" he said. Such a meeting would add to a history of approaches to the scaling solution that have included a number of in-person meetings. Of note is the famed 'Hong Kong agreement' that saw some developers and miners agree on a roadmap that was then met with delays and disagreement from those that didn't attend. Since then, appetite for in-person meetings is perhaps low – a fact exacerbated by the fact no one wants to be seen as in charge of the protocol or its decision-making. Blockstream CEO Adam Back rejected DCG's invitation on the grounds that he believes there's an implication he represents bitcoin's volunteer developer team. ""There is a persistent incorrect assumption that Blockstream [is the same as] Core, or that, by implication, I speak for bitcoin developers. Neither of these are correct, so if that expectation is in the room it will just feed the false narrative,"" he wrote in an email to the investment firm, which has a stake in Blockstream. This constant confusion over who represents what, or speaks for who, has added increasing difficulty to the discussion. Indeed, irrespective of the proposals, there is even the matter of who gets to decide what agreement is, even if there was consensus around a technical fix. Among the options are users, businesses, miners and developers, though determining who even falls into which category, as evidenced by exchanges above, remains a challenge. Blockstream co-founder Pieter Wuille showcased the perception issue in his response to Chun's proposal, in which he suggested that developers don't have the power to force bitcoin users to accept a change, such as a 2MB block size increase. He argued that if Bitcoin Core ""blacklisted"" network activity in a new software version, for example, users could simply choose not to download the new software version if they didn't support the change. Still, it could be argued that the negative sentiment has nonetheless galvanized historic levels of open discussion. With at least three scaling ideas offered in the past week, adding to many others over the last few years, it seems there's no end in sight to the ongoing conversation – but that that might not be a bad thing in the context of technical innovation.

                            The Gold Rush Begins: The Day Bitcoin Topped the US Dollar                        ",Roger Ver,https://www.coindesk.com/the-gold-rush-begins-bitcoin-tops-the-dollar/,"One of bitcoin's earliest angel investors, Roger Ver has backed a number of startups including BitPay, Purse and ShapeShift, and is the owner of resource portal Bitcoin.com. Ver is noted as both an outspoken evangelist for the technology and one of the first 'bitcoin millionaires'. In the first entry in CoinDesk's ""Bitcoin Milestones"" series, Ver discusses his initial brush with the technology and recounts the watershed moment when a single bitcoin became more valuable than the US dollar.   I first heard the word 'bitcoin' in November or December 2010 thanks to a mention of it on the FreeTalkLive.com podcast. It sounded interesting enough. I maybe spent a few moments Googling it. At the time one bitcoin was worth about $0.10. I thought to myself, ""This is interesting, but if no one is using it, it isn't worth anything."" I moved on with my life after only about five minutes of research... *** In February 2011, I heard bitcoin mentioned again, so I decided to Google it once again. The price was now around $0.40, and this time I started to see the bigger picture. I began to understand that: That's when the dots (helped by years of studying Marx and Mises) connected in my mind. I realized that people were going to start using bitcoin as money and that I needed to buy some, but that was easier said than done in those days. There was no Coinbase, Xapo or Blockchain. In fact, the only wallet was the Bitcoin-QT full client that still had the option of CPU mining in it. The only option for buying bitcoin was a website with a strange domain called Mt. Gox. I contacted the website and received a personalized response rather quickly from the site's owner, Jed McCaleb (he hadn't yet sold the business to Mark Karpeles). After an email exchange or two, I decided to send $25,000 to what I recall was a personal bank account in New York. I waited for him to credit my account at Mt. Gox... and the price of bitcoin rose... and then it rose some more... *** Several days went by, but Gox still hadn't credited my wire transfer. I began to grow impatient... The price was rising ever closer to $1. As the price rose, so did my frustration at not having had my wire credited... but I wasn't deterred. My excitement for the future potential of bitcoin was rising as well – and I was openly telling friends about bitcoin. One of them was less than convinced. When I explained bitcoin to him, and how I had just initiated a purchase of $25,000 worth because they were so amazing, he sarcastically replied, ""If you think bitcoins are so great, why don't you buy more of them?"" As soon as he said that to me, I knew he was right, and that I should buy more of them! That very same day I initiated a second wire to Mt Gox. Somewhere in between, bitcoin passed $1... *** As anyone who has owned bitcoin before knows, the moment you have some yourself, you feel much more connected with the cause and the people in the ecosystem. I couldn't help but tell anyone who would listen to me about all the wonderful ways in which bitcoin was about to change the world for the better. I would literally tell anyone who would listen. From strangers in a restaurant, to cashiers at convenience stores, to everyone at family gatherings or weddings, whether they wanted to hear about bitcoin or not. (Many of them did not!) I paid for the world's first bitcoin billboard and national radio ads. I set up the first major store to accept bitcoin as payment. I was involved with many other projects. The more bitcoin companies I invested in and the more bitcoins I bought, the more fun the whole experience became. I knew that we were all working on a fundamentally world-changing technology, but the rest of the world still had no idea. But, the real turning point for me though was owning my first bitcoin, and watching the price cross the $1 barrier for the first time. I still remember the naysayers claiming that a bitcoin could never be worth a whole dollar each. They claimed that bitcoin was just a bubble, a Ponzi scheme, or no different than digital Beanie Babies. They were all wrong, and I gladly told them so. Today, many people still dismiss bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't guaranteed to be the winning cryptocurrency in the end. But its invention is guaranteed to have changed the world forever.  Bitcoin and US dollar image via Shutterstock

                            Purse Proposal Touts Extension Blocks as Bitcoin Scaling Solution                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/purse-proposal-touts-extension-blocks-bitcoin-scaling-solution/," Bitcoin startup Purse is spearheading work on a new solution it believes could break the network's long-simmering scaling gridlock. In a new blog post issued today, Purse has released a specification that includes demo functionality and code for upgrading its bitcoin software implementation, Bcoin, to support ""extension blocks"". The technical update seeks to enable the network to optionally support different kinds of blocks in addition to the default 1 MB blocks that today make up the main bitcoin blockchain (and that have long been a source of community tension). The move to develop the technology finds Purse pitching its implementation – one that is today an alternative to versions by Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited – as a third option in the scaling debate that would bring about a block size increase and malleability fix via soft fork, or a change that doesn't risk splitting the bitcoin blockchain. Founded in 2014 as a startup that enables bitcoin users to get discounts when shopping at Amazon, Purse has been increasingly interested in network development, launching Bcoin in September of last year. Developer Joseph Poon and BitPay CEO Stephen Pair contributed to the release. So far, the idea is said to have support from bitcoin's mining community, though miners did not have any preferred access to the code, a source said. Industry firms also appear to be anticipating the release, with BitPay reporting it is eager to test the idea as an alternative to a contentious hard fork. In remarks, CEO Stephen Pair said the bitcoin payments processing startup was afraid of needing to shut down in the face of such an event, and that it is open to all alternative ideas. Pair noted that he recently broached the topic in a blog post, which he credited as helping to spark new development on the idea. Pair said: As shown by the comments, the idea comes at a time when interest among network users in exploratory ways to reach consensus on changes to the network rules remains high. As such, Purse CEO Andrew Lee framed the solution as one that seeks to jumpstart momentum for bitcoin through effective compromise, writing: As for how the idea would progress, those close to the project expressed that they want the announcement to be viewed as the start of a conversation on the idea. So far, it seems there is enthusiasm among some network stakeholders, with mining pool F2Pool even citing the software last week, embedding a message in the bitcoin blockchain that referenced the proposal. Mining firm ViaBTC, an outspoken supporter of the Bitcoin Unlimited software, also tweeted its approval for the concept, and Bitmain is said to be supportive as well. An effort was also made to heavily publicize the effort with major media outlets as a potentially ""momentous"" development for the network. As detailed in the post, the idea is to now garner miner support for the technical fix. ""Once a supermajority of miners have flagged for this change, users can begin using these features enabling entirely new use cases for bitcoin,"" the post reads. Purse went on to state that it would like for the resulting conversation to involve ""users, miners and industry"", remarking that any eventual upgrade is still months away. If introduced, this would not be the first time work on a proposal for extension blocks would see public discussion. Commentary on the proposal surfaced on the bitcoin development mailing list as far back as 2015, when Blockstream CEO Adam Back discussed how the network might adopt extension blocks. ""The interesting thing is this makes block sizes changes opt-in and gives users choice. Choice is good,"" Back wrote. A more extended history of discussion on the concept can be found in the mailing list archives as well. As recently as this January, the subject was advanced again, though some developers offered concerns about the change. Bitcoin Core developers indicated that they are aware of the proposal, responding with concerns about the complexity of the code, as well as the precedent that could occur should the proposal be aggressively adopted by one constituency of the network or without sufficient review. Worries were also raised about how this would affect access to the network, and whether technicality increases brought about by more custom blocks would only be accessible to a minority stakeholders and users.

                            Bitcoin Exchange Bitfinex Buys Back All Remaining 'Hack Credit' Tokens                        ",Garrett Keirns,https://www.coindesk.com/bitfinex-pledges-buy-back-remaining-hack-credit-tokens/,"Digital currency exchange Bitfinex today announced it has bought back all of the remaining cryptographic tokens it used to reimburse investors who lost funds in its August 2016 hack. Citing increased equity conversions and strong operating results, Bitfinex reduced its internal reserves to purchase the remaining tokens at their $1 face value, and moved to shut down the markets associated with them. At press time, officials at the exchange said all so-called 'BFX tokens' have been destroyed, and that investors have been reimbursed with US dollars. The redemption occurred today beginning at 20:00:00 UTC, with fund requests settling within 45 minutes. During that time, trading of the BFX token was halted and all margin positions were liquidated. The move follows the August 2016 hack of the exchange, in which investors were given a 36% haircut to compensate for a hack that drained 120,000 BTC from the exchange’s reserves. The BFX tokens thus represented an equity obligation to return the 36% back to platform users sometime in the future. Notably, this isn't the first internal BFX buyback orchestrated by Bitfinex, as the exchange purchased 1% of the tokens in September 2016. The $1 face value tokens had traded between $0.49 and $0.65 for most of 2016, surrounded by doubts that the exchange would never be able to recoup the nearly $72m in value lost following the security breach. That price increased to $0.89 by 1 March 2017 following a strong period of heavy trading volume in the cryptocurrency markets. The announcement posted on the company's webpage expressed gratitude for the patience of the community and continued support.

Proposed by developer Sergio Lerner, ""Segwit2MB"" seeks to combine Segregated Witness, the proposal put forward by Bitcoin Core, the network's volunteer developer team, and an increase of the block size to 2 MB, first outlined in BIP 102. The proposal would still require 95% miner support to enact SegWit, though the proposal would begin a countdown to a network-wide backwards incompatible block size change on 14th December, 2017. (The block size hard fork would only occur if SegWit were to reach the consensus threshold and be activated). Following a brief comment period, Lerner plans to formally add the Segwit2mb to the Bitcoin Core Github page as a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP). The patch currently being proposed would modify the existing 120 lines of code comprising Bitcoin Core and add an additional 220 lines of testing code. However, this is subject to change following the comment period. Lerner’s hypothesis is that by appeasing both sides of the scaling debate that consensus will be reached more quickly, ultimately settling a conflict that has drawn on for years.

                            'Confidential Assets': Blockstream Reveals New Bitcoin Privacy Tech                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/confidential-assets-blockstream-reveals-new-bitcoin-privacy-tech/,"Bitcoin startup Blockstream has unveiled new technology for shielding data on a blockchain. Expanding on an old technique used to hide transaction amounts, the company has developed a new scheme dubbed 'confidential assets' to conceal the types of assets in a transaction. Revealing just how the tech works, the startup has released a new paper today, co-authored by Blockstream developers Andrew Poelstra, Adam Back, Mark Friedenbach, Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille. Using confidential assets, viewers of a blockchain would be able to see a transaction's senders and receivers, but not what kind of asset is traded – whether bitcoin, stocks, gold, or something else. So why is hiding asset types important? Banks have made it known that they aren't thrilled that blockchains make certain information public, and have been increasingly exploring various ways of making their holdings private while still taking advantage of the ability to share the database of transactions with others. Against that backdrop, Blockstream CEO Adam Back framed confidential assets as a technology to help enterprises overcome what he called this ""awkward tradeoff"". Tokyo-based marketing company Digital Garage has been revealed as the first partner to use the new tech, as a part of Blockstream's Elements sidechains initiative, with plans to use it to shield loyalty points. Blockstream core tech engineer Greg Sanders described confidentiality as a ""key requirement"" for Digital Garage, as well as other companies using blockchain tech. He told CoinDesk: However, the tech is not yet being used in a production setting. Blockstream has been exploring the enterprise blockchain world over the past couple of years, including joining the Hyperledger consortium and deploying private blockchains on top of bitcoin. It's also been testing privacy features on Elements sidechains, including using ‘confidential transactions’ – a technique first proposed by Back – to shield transaction amounts from non-participants in the system. In a nutshell, the system uses cryptography to prove that people are getting their money, even while the details aren’t revealed to everyone. Yet anyone, including nodes, can verify that the transaction is valid. Confidential assets extends this concept to shield multiple assets. However, there is a downside of both confidential transactions and confidential assets – they require much more space on the blockchain than standard transactions. Confidential assets is currently being tested on a Blockstream Elements sidechain, though it can potentially be ported elsewhere. According to Back, though, while the system works on a sidechain, it's is not suitable for bitcoin proper, since the digital currency's code doesn’t support other asset types. However, some other projects now use confidential transactions, including MimbleWimble and the privacy project ValueShuffle. And if developers of such projects chose to, they could effectively upgrade to support confidential assets instead. In conclusion, Back described the new technology as a part of a larger push for adoption of bitcoin and blockchain technology, saying: Venetian blind image via Shutterstock

Having mined its first block as part of a closed beta three months ago, BitmainTech Israel Ltd is now opening its ConnectBTC pool to global bitcoin miners, inviting them to run the software as a way to combine resources with other miners and better compete for bitcoin's rewards. ConnectBTC manager Gadi Glikberg explained that the pool was written from scratch by a team independent from Bitmain's signature AntPool operation – a mining pool that's currently the leader in combined hashing power, according to data from Blockchain. ""We believe in this manner we can make sure we serve the mining community with the best possible products,"" Gilkberg said. Notably, ConnectBTC appears to be operating slightly out of step with its parent company, which has been one of the more vocal proponents of the idea network participants should run alternative software versions that would expand the size of the transactions blocks it can process. ConnectBTC, Glikberg said, is running the Bitcoin Core client, and noted that it's ""not signaling"" for either an upgrade to SegWit (the Core development team's preferred solution) or Bitcoin Unlimited (an alternative software Bitmain has said it intends to support). Such public remarks have recently seen Bitmain reignite the long-standing debate on how bitcoin will increase its transaction capacity, while boosting concerns the network could potentially split into two competing blockchain networks. Bitmain declined to offer additional comment. Pool image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Rebounds As Price Tops $1,100                        ",Daniel Palmer,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-prices-up-over-3-today-top-1140/," Bitcoin prices have surged today, rising over 3% overall since the start of trading and at one stage topping $1,141. At the time of reporting, the price of a bitcoin had fallen slightly to around $1,134, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, though the general trend seems to be still rising. The sudden increase comes after a fall in prices following the rejection by the SEC of the Winklevoss brothers' bitcoin ETF last month. Bitcoin had been trading at record highs last month in expectation of the announcement, at one stage closing on $1,300 per coin, and surpassing even the per-spot price for an ounce of gold – truly justifying bitcoin's moniker 'digital gold' for the second time in its history. Further, there has been debate in the industry over the path forward for bitcoin and how best to scale the technology going forward. That discussion has led to talk of a 'hard fork' of the core software – a possibility that could split the digital currency into two rival coins. Fears over the issue seemed to have hit prices late last month, as bitcoin once again exchanged hands at sub-$1,000 prices mid-to-late March. While it's never easy to directly link events in the real world to movements on the price charts, it would seem that bitcoin traders are shrugging off concerns over the scaling issue and still seeing the core value in the cryptocurrency.

                            All Business? Bitcoin is Becoming a Hobby for Exchange Employees                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/business-bitcoin-becoming-hobby-exchange-employees/,"After years of grabbing global headlines, it seems bitcoin is making inroads with employees at exchanges and solutions providers in the sector. At the World Exchange Congress this week, bitcoin wasn't a frequent topic of discussion, appearing only in conversations spurred by evangelists. Still, while many companies are still trying to make sense of applications for distributed ledger tech (DLT), their employees appear to be embracing the general idea as hobbyists, using cryptocurrencies as a way to learn – and earn – on the side. For example, Lazlo Szabo, a member of the IT department at the publicly owned Budapest Stock Exchange, wasn't able to provide much insight into what his firm is doing to get up to speed on developments in the blockchain sector. ""For the company, it's a lot – we have another problems to solve before we take a huge step,"" Szabo said, noting the exchange is already upgrading its trading engine. Still, that isn’t stopping Szabo from checking websites CoinMarketCap, a cryptocurrency price and information page, daily with about five of his other co-workers. He told CoinDesk: Szabo went on to suggest he believes the technology will ""become more common"", though he's not sure when or how it will end up being applied. The case is much the same for Elie Cezard, fixed income business director at exchange tech provider Trading Screen. Cezard reported being active in his local blockchain communities, and said Trading Screen had even been in discussions to add bitcoin as an FX option, though the plan never quite came to fruition. Like other peers at the event, Cezard sees more potential for the tech in back-end settlement and post-trade clearing sectors. ""Our clients are institutional investors and, for the moment, there's no way we can really get institutional investors to go into cryptocurrencies,"" he said. Still, he acknowledged that other companies are moving in that direction. Also notable were the number of respondents who spoke generally about digital currencies and blockchain, with some being quick to see applications for the tech, and others seeming unsure of just what to make of it. Paul Bwiso, CEO for the Uganda Securities Exchange, the nation's principal stock exchange, sees the appeal in bitcoin as a kind of virtual money. Given the importance of the mobile phone in Africa’s financial system, he sees the link, even if he doesn’t believe it’s an opportunity for his operation. Still, he said he was positive generally about the tech, remarking: ""I think it's the future."" A similar outlook was put forward by Khalifa Bin Ebrahim, CEO of Bahrain Bourse, who argued that he believes blockchain will first find its way into finance, if first in back-office, post-trade systems. ""It will be a good value proposition to build a strong case,"" he said. Among the crowd was also a handful of skeptics – not of bitcoin, but of the idea that its underlying blockchain technologies could be more broadly applied. One such voice was Riskbone founder Lanre Sarumi, who said he believes bitcoin has a ""clear direction"" and that the blockchain is an obvious use case for a global currency. Still, Sarumi hasn’t found a way to work cryptocurrencies into his offering. That doesn’t mean he’s not looking, though, and he expressed interest in trading bitcoin futures – in part because of the issues surrounding storing and holding cryptographic keys that manage access to blockchain-linked data. He also spoke to broad concerns amongst traders about the relatively new asset, showcasing just how far bitcoin has to go, even with those who understand it well. ""You don't want to be the one holding on to bitcoin when it completely collapses,"" he said. Kraken business development lead Reed Holmes reported that more hobbyists are beginning to turn to the cryptocurrency market on the side, drawn like Sarumi to its perceived future impact. ""A lot of these guys are pure traders, they’re hobbyists, they seem to be really interested in it,"" he said, though he acknowledged action by their companies is so far more scarce. Holmes concluded: Image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk

                            Bitcoin vs Gold: Which is a Better Long-Term Bet?                        ",Aaron Stanley,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-gold-better-long-term-bet/,"Imagine that you have $100,000 at your disposal. You must spend all of it on either bitcoin or gold – no mixing and matching – and the assets will then be stored in a trust that cannot be accessed again for 50 years. Which option would you choose? With the two commodities now in roughly the same price range, it's worth putting aside some of bitcoin's short-term volatility and liquidity concerns to compare them as long-term stores of value side by side. Sure, you might argue bitcoin is newer and flashier, and that it has arguably more utility in the digital era than gold. But, gold has the indisputable track record, having been a cherished store of value for thousands of years across human civilizations. However, bitcoin's traits have led to those backing the cryptocurrency to believe it could potentially unseat gold over the long haul. Spencer Bogart, an analyst with Blockchain Capital and formerly of Needham & Company, told CoinDesk: Another key advantage bitcoin has over gold is that its supply level is fixed and transparent – eliminating fears of the typical inflationary pressures associated with overproduction that could diminish the value of the asset. ""A well-known characteristic about bitcoin is that it’s on a disinflationary supply schedule. While many people think of gold as being the same, gold is actually a sneakily inflationary asset,"" said Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead with ARK Investment Management. Burniske added that the global supply of gold has clandestinely increased by 1–2% annually over the last century. He continued: Such characteristics, in theory, serve to increase bitcoin’s future utility as a means of account, exchange and storing value. They also suggest that bitcoin's value, usefulness and importance to society will only continue to grow as commerce becomes more digitized. ""As more infrastructure is built around [bitcoin], we think that demand will rise relative to its mathematically metered supply, increasing its price support,"" Burniske wrote in a recent white paper. The clear advantages that gold has over bitcoin are trust and reliability, according to those surveyed for this article. However, a change in consumer preferences, new technological disruption or a crackdown by a government could easily kick bitcoin to the end of the bench. ""Gold has something very important that bitcoin lacks: a more than 1,000-year history of being a decent store of value. This is very important for trust and people's willingness to store value in that particular asset,"" said Bogart. Gold has also proven itself to be of value even when governments attempt to restrict its usage or outlaw it completely. This happened in 1933, when President Franklin D Roosevelt implemented measures to prohibit and criminalize its possession in the US. ""For more than 5,000 years gold and silver have been tried-and-true money. They've lasted basically the duration of organized civilization,"" said Dave Kranzler of Investment Research Dynamics. In this light, Kranzler was keen to highlight bitcoin's 'counterparty risk'. Gold's advantage over bitcoin is that it's not dependent on the operation of the internet, thus affording it a degree of protection from heavy-handed regimes, he said. ""There’s nothing to stop any government from shutting down the internet in their country under the guise of national security purposes or what not,” he said, adding: Gold has also proven itself immune to technological disruption. According to Burniske, while bitcoin has generated significant cultural cachet, it remains at the bleeding edge and could still be dethroned relatively easily. ""That position is not necessarily going to remain the case if bitcoin is not able to attract new users and provide a happy medium in terms of user experience,"" he said. Yet, as asset classes like Dutch tulips, Japanese real estate, dot-com companies and the US housing market have boomed and busted, gold has consistently plodded ahead, withstanding the test of time. ""I don’t think anyone can say with any certainty that any man-made system is going to be valuable 50 years from now,"" said Josh Crumb, co-founder of GoldMoney and a former commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs. He continued: While investors like Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have suggested that technological developments as far fetched as asteroid mining could eventually put upward pressure on the total supply of gold (and reduce its scarcity), Crumb reckons that technological creative destruction poses a much greater threat to bitcoin. ""People have been trying to crack gold for 600 years. I think it's much more likely that we're going to have quantum computing that can change cryptography than asteroid mining that's going to bring back loads of gold,"" he said. Perhaps asking whether bitcoin will ever unseat gold as the universal store of value isn't quite appropriate, as it's plausible that the two can, and will, co-exist as complementary assets. ""I like bitcoin, particularly in the short-term, so it's kind of like saying 'Do you like gold or do you like investing in Facebook in 2011?'"" said Crumb. ""To me, it’s two totally different things."" As is standard practice across other realms of investing, the correct answer to the bitcoin versus gold question will ultimately be determined by the risk profile of each particular investor. ""In terms of proper portfolio construction, you want to diversify. You want to have different types of assets that don’t necessarily move together,"" said Burniske, concluding: Bitcoin image via Shutterstock

The digital currency surpassed the per-spot ounce price of gold on 2nd March, when it traded for $1,238 and gold was listed at $1,237 on the XAU/USD spot exchange rate provided by Bloomberg Markets. The event marked the second time in history bitcoin was worth more than gold. This time round, bitcoin was trading high amid optimism that the SEC could soon approve a bitcoin ETF for retail investors. Still, bitcoin didn't enjoy this superior position for long. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), prices have fallen sharply since the eventual rejection – a trend that continued amid uncertainty about the future of its technical roadmap. Overall, bitcoin's price managed to trade higher than gold until 7th March, when prices fell below $1,200, BPI figures show. Gold prices, in comparison, closed at $1,215.86, according to Bloomberg data. Bitcoin once again surpassed gold on 10th March, the day of the SEC decision, when its price surged to an all-time high of more than $1,300.  However, as the SEC rejected the proposed fund, bitcoin prices plunged, nearing $1,000. As a result, bitcoin once again traded south of gold, which closed the day at $1,204.64. Bitcoin again popped up to surpass the precious metal on 12th and 16th March. The digital currency didn't stay north of gold for long, and it fell below its precious metal counterpart later on 16th March. With the prices diverging, it may be that this ends the latest attempt for the digital currency to live up to its often-used descriptor, 'digital gold'. In fact, though, bitcoin and gold have frequently shown little relationship in terms of their price movements. While the two assets have frequently displayed a strong price correlation during times of economic crisis, this relationship has often deteriorated once economic conditions calmed down. (A prior analysis of gold and bitcoin prices conducted by ARK Invest's Chris Burniske failed to reveal a strong relationship between bitcoin and gold.) Still, today there are several retail products that investors can use to trade gold. Bitcoin, on the other hand, lacks such securities. As a result, the bitcoin-gold price relationship could change quite a bit going forward – and remains one to watch. Gold bars image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Mining Fraud Lawsuit Moves Forward in New Jersey                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-mining-fraud-lawsuit-moves-forward-new-jersey/,"A federal lawsuit filed by investors of a US-based bitcoin mining operation is moving ahead after months of little movement. In mid-2014, investors in Lab Rat Data Processing alleged breach of contract, misrepresentation and fraud against the mining operation and its owner, Zachary Dailey. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain, with miners racing for the chance to mint new bitcoins as a reward. The ten plaintiffs alleged losses of over 2,000 bitcoins, an amount worth more than $2m at press time. Yet they hit a roadblock last year, after US District Judge Joseph Rodriguez questioned whether the New Jersey court actually had jurisdiction in the matter. As reported at the time by the New Jersey Law Journal, the judge focused on the question of whether mining contracts sold by Lab Rat constituted ""bonds"" as argued by the plaintiffs. Rodriguez also moved to deflect a bid by the defendants to have the suit dismissed. A new court order indicates that the years-long legal effort is now progressing. On 30th March, Rodriguez sided with the plaintiffs, stating in an opinion that they had successfully argued that the court does, in fact, have jurisdiction over the case. ""In light of the allegations set forth in the chart and the additional details provided in the proposed Second Amended Complaint, the Court is satisfied that it has diversity of citizenship subject matter jurisdiction and the amendment is not futile,"" Rodriguez wrote.

                            Despite Reports, India's Bitcoin Policy Hasnât Changed                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/despite-reports-india-bitcoin-policy-no-change/,"Media sources in India reported this week that the government had deemed bitcoin illegal, causing a stir that appearedÂ to be overblown. Newspapers such as The Economic Times of IndiaÂ declared that, according to a statement from Minister of State for Finance Arjun Ram Meghwal, use of the digital currency was ""illegal"" and exposed users to potential violations of anti-money laundering rules. Initially greeted as a shift in policy for India, which is home to a range of companies working on both bitcoin and blockchain-related projects, the statement has since come to be seen as merely a reiteration of an earlier position taken by officials in the country. Indeed, the statement was nearly identical to one issued by the Reserve Bank of India in late 2013, which was largely a warning about price volatility and theft risks. ""The absence of information of counterparties in such peer-to-peer anonymous/ pseudonymous systems could subject the users to unintentional breaches of anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws,"" the central bank said at the time. A published copy of the question posed to the Indian government bears out these similarities: Regardless of its interpretation, the controversy sparked by the misconstrued statement has led to calls for the Indian government to clearly outline its position on the legality of bitcoin. A petitionÂ created on Change.org has attracted just over 7,600 signatures. A second one, similar in scope, has drawn more than 1,110 supporters. India map image via Shutterstock

                            Japan's Bitcoin Law Goes Into Effect Tomorrow                        ",Garrett Keirns,https://www.coindesk.com/japan-bitcoin-law-effect-tomorrow/,"Japan is set to begin recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment starting tomorrow. The country's legislature passed a law, following months of debate, that brought bitcoin exchanges under anti-money laundering/know-your-customer rules, while also categorizing bitcoin as a kind of prepaid payment instrument. It's a debate that began in the wake of the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that shuttered after months of growing complications and, in the end, revelations of insolvency and alleged fraud. According to Japan’s Financial Services Agency, that law goes into effect on 1st April, putting in place capital requirements for exchanges as well as cybersecurity and operational stipulations. In addition, those exchanges will also be required to conduct employee training programs and submit to annual audits. Yet there may be more work to come in this area. For example, Nomura Research Institute's Yasutake Okano indicated in a May 2016 report that other Japanese laws may need to change to account for the tech, including the Banking Act and Financial Instruments and Exchange Act. Reports indicate that other groups in Japan are moving to plug some of those gaps as well. According to a report from Nikkei, the Accounting Standards Board of Japan decided earlier this week to begin developing standards for digital currencies like bitcoin. Its work mirrors other efforts being undertaken elsewhere, including Australia, which began pushing for such standards late last year. Image via Shutterstock

                            Private Blockchains for Bitcoin Maximalists                        ",Martin Hagelstrom,https://www.coindesk.com/private-blockchains-bitcoin-maximalists/,"Martin Hagelstrom is a bitcoin enthusiast, project executive and consultant working on IT projects at IBM. In this opinion piece, Hagelstrom takes on the private vs public blockchain debate, arguing that, while bitcoin may be a more interesting technology, private blockchains offer real business utility.   I'm sure reading the comments on this piece won't be pretty... There are countless blog posts describing what a blockchain is, and particularly what private blockchains are, but you may notice the funny fact that none of them agree with each other. I won't try to give another definition. Instead, I will try to add some more fuel to the fire. Private blockchains make sense, and yes, I intend to argue that point even though I consider myself a bitcoin maximalist. Now, let me address some of what I expect will be your key arguments: Sure, so what? Have you ever thought that the level of security needed for an open and anonymous network is not the same needed for one where all the participants are known and have some level of trust between each other? Of course, but only if you want to use proof of work. When transactions are not anonymous, you might want to use a simpler consensus mechanism. After all, you only want to keep the data consistent between nodes and be able to detect if someone doesn't follow the rules. In bitcoin, miners need an incentive to invest resources independent of the transactions they will be validating and securing. After all they don't even know who is transacting and what those transactions are for. On the other hand, in a private blockchain, participants are incentivized by the goal established on that particular business network. If they think that by achieving multi-organization integration on a particular process will bring them cost reduction, that is incentive enough to play their role on the network. We agree again. But, we need to distinguish between tamper-proof and tamper-evident systems. If grouping data in blocks and chaining them through hashes makes it possible to detect that someone changed history, it might be enough if I am able to identify the one who did. Remember, we are not talking about anonymous members, so things might be easier when there are contracts in place that govern what happens when someone cheats. Technologically speaking, probably. But, governance is usually the hardest issue to tackle on intra-organizational integration projects. Implementing a traditional database, even a distributed one, means that the organizations need to agree on: Good luck with that. But, if we can have a decentralized system where everybody can have a copy and only append new data validated by the rest of the members of the network, a very big obstacle is removed. OK, but big companies don't implement new tech because it is 'cool' or 'interesting'. The whole point of investing in technology is to achieve some kind of efficiency in their business. If running a multi-company business process can help them to reduce manual steps or validations, costs and risks, or even create new revenue streams, it might be enough to go for it. In fact, their duty to their shareholders is to improve their bottom line, not having the coolest technology on the block. Definitely no. But, as I said before, as long as we can achieve efficiencies or an interesting return of investment, it is still a very attractive technology for enterprises. In the meantime, we can all keep learning about the technology, test new functionalities and grow the ecosystem with human and monetary resources. You never know, some of that, directly or indirectly, might even end up benefitting bitcoin. Bitcoin image via Shutterstock

The round was led by MAIF Avenir, an arm of French insurance giant MAIF. Others taking part in the Series A round include Xange, Wicklow Capital, GDTRE, Libertus Capital, Digital Currency Group, The Whittemore Collection, Kima Ventures, BHB Network, and investor Nicolas Pinto. Ledger, which makes hardware for users to store and maintain control over their cryptocurrency private keys, plans to use that funding to expand its reach into the enterprise market. Notably, the startup intends to open a new factory in China as part of its hardware push, with an eye on a launch sometime in the next few months. Co-founder Eric Larchevêque told CoinDesk: The new round comes more than two years after Ledger raised €1.3m in seed funding. In that time, the startup has moved to release wallets that support other cryptocurrencies and, in November, launched the Ledger Blue, a departure from its previous thumb drive-style aesthetic. Ledger now plans to expand its reach into the enterprise space, with an eye to bring larger companies into its customer base – Larchevêque said he hopes to have the first beta customers in place by the end of June. The startup is also looking to grow its sales figures for the year, aiming to sell 100,000 units in 2017. MAIF, which led the round, said it invested in the startup as a means to contribute to more confidence and security in cryptocurrency transactions. Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Ledger.

Traders Offer Mixed Opinions on Market Direction                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-split-market-direction/," The path forward for bitcoin prices isn't clear, market analysts say. While some described the market to CoinDesk as bearish overall, other observers offered a more optimistic stance about the prospects for future price developments. Their input comes as bitcoin prices have largely traded rangebound in the last few days, fluctuating between $1,010 and $1,060, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). While bitcoin prices reached an all-time high of more than $1,300 earlier this month in the lead up to the US Securities and Exchange Commission ruling on the bitcoin ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss twins, they have fallen since. Interestingly enough, bitcoin prices were little changed when the SEC shot down a bitcoin ETF proposed by SolidX. Others highlighted that sentiment has, for better or worse, changed in recent days. Much of the attention seems to have squared on the prospects of a possible bitcoin hard fork – and the resulting tension that has taken hold. ""The market has seen a switch in sentiment from hope of ETF approval to the ugliness of internal fighting,"" said Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of CryptoCompare. Some analysts pointed to this ongoing dilemma when providing their overall bearish views of the market. One lingering concern is that a fork could drive down prices sharply, prompting some to hedge their bets ahead of any possible disruption. According to Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, the situation is becoming a key driver of that bearishness. He told CoinDesk: Not all agreed with this assessment, however. OTC trader Harry Yeh struck a more practical outlook, arguing that bitcoin's upside has been limited as a result. ""We see this as being priced in now and don't foresee major prices moves past $1,200 in the near term,"" he said. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, offered similar sentiment, telling CoinDesk that ""hard fork concerns are capping upward movement"". However, he also emphasized that ""solid BTC fundamentals, interest and growth potential"" were creating a floor for prices. While Enneking offered a moderate assessment of the situation, a handful of analysts insisted that bitcoin's long-term trend was bullish. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, stated that the digital currency's recent pullbacks in price represent a ""healthy correction"". ""The additional uncertainty surrounding the potential hard fork also acts as a price dampener,"" he added. Image via Shutterstock

                            Inside IC3: How Cornell is Advancing the Science of Bitcoin                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/inside-ic3-cornell-science-of-magic-internet-money-bitcoin/,"We’re squeezed into a small room filled with tall black server racks. Fans interweave with computers, sputtering cold air. The whirring noise is so loud it drowns out Cornell PhD candidate Adem Efe Gencer as he explains that inside the mundane set of racks is Cornell's ambitious attempt to model the global bitcoin network – all in the name of science. The servers, he notes, make up about half of a bitcoin testbed that comprises more than 1,200 nodes. More are in the basement below. Called 'Miniature World', the project is named after the diorama copies of real-world places presented at tourist attractions. Except, rather than toy cars and cardboard buildings, Miniature World models bitcoin's sprawling network of nodes. Gencer remarks: The most obvious question then, is, what are they doing with this massive complex of nodes? Gencer is a part of IC3, a Cornell arm that's dedicated solely to the study of cryptocurrencies, and he's studying how the system as a whole may react to a different rules or possible adversarial conditions. The team has big plans for the 'little' network. ""We want to expand it. The ultimate goal is to make it as large as the bitcoin public network,"" he said. To be clear, that's a lot of nodes. According to bitcoin network statistics from Bitnodes, there are nearly 7,000, but including non-listening nodes (those that don't accept new connections to other nodes), the count adds up to more than 50,000.  Paired with this testbed, Cornell has developed a framework for what Gencer views as a more ""principled"" way of comparing protocols, one that involves measuring metrics such as delays in passing information and the system's resilience to centralization. Miniature World is capable of running any client or more inventive protocols, like Bitcoin-NG, which radically re-engineers bitcoin with the goal of scaling it to support more transactions. ""As long as a client is given to our system, we can run it,"" he said. Gencer framed this way of measuring affects to the network in contrast to the systems bitcoin uses in its decision-making today – some would argue to questionable effect. ""There's another approach in bitcoin community that is quite popular, which is discussion,"" Gencer joked, alluding to the constant dialogue on social media platforms such as Twitter and Reddit. Others have suggested that simulations aren't perfect yet, either, given that the technology is in its early stages and it's difficult still to tell where they're effective.  Miniature World isn’t IC3's only bitcoin project, however. Falcon, which launched last year, is one of the institution's more notable public blockchain efforts, aiming as it does to help decentralize the bitcoin network. The network, made up of 10 nodes maintained by Cornell, provides a 'fast lane' that miners and mining pools of all sizes can use to send and receive blocks more quickly. ""This equalizes the playing field [between miners] a lot,"" said Cornell graduate student Soumya Basu while white-boarding the system. To date, Falcon has been lauded for offering a second bitcoin relay network to help miners propagate blocks across the network more quickly. Previously, there was only one: FIBRE, formerly known as the Bitcoin Relay Network. Basu emphasized that a diversity of options could be useful for miners. ""If you only have one relay network and it goes down for some reason (maintenance, being attacked, etc), then block propagation becomes much slower for that time period,"" he said. IC3 co-director Emin Gün Sirer agreed, arguing that with additional implementations, users don't have to put trust in just one open-source network and the volunteer group that maintains it. Again, the project isn't there just for efficiency's sake. In interview, Basu argued that having multiple initiatives like Falcon could help bitcoin better achieve its goals by minimizing trust. ""Relay networks are in a position of power. If a relay network decides to propagate some blocks slower than other blocks, they can make attacks such as selfish mining easier to pull off,"" he said. Here, Basu hinted at how Cornell is interested in the game theory behind bitcoin as well. ""If you have multiple relay networks propagating blocks, then the benefit of slowing down a particular miner's block is very limited,"" he said. Basu, Sirer and IC3 associate director Ittay Eyal, the drivers of the project, also say they have come up with an innovation – called 'cut-through routing,' that's now included in FIBRE – which increases the speed at which the network can propagate blocks. Today, Cornell's Miniature World is one of a number of notable bitcoin simulators. Although there are others including one open-sourced by Swiss technology university Eth Zürich. But, it's also seeking to maintain a lead by expanding its work to other notable blockchain and cryptocurrency projects. To that end, Gencer said Cornell is working on a version of ethereum that will run on the same infrastructure as the current testbed. He said: Images via Pete Rizzo and Alyssa Hertig

In its notice, the SEC cited justifications similar to those used in the Winklevoss ETF decision, namely a lack of market surveillance and a dearth of regulation in some jurisdictions. The SEC wrote: The agency had earlier moved to delay its decision in September, punting a final determination until the end of this week at the latest. While representatives for the SEC did not immediately respond to a request for comment, some kind of decision (or another delay) was anticipated by Friday.

                            War of the Words: Who's Said What About a Bitcoin Fork?                        ","Alyssa Hertig, Stan Higgins & Garrett Keirns",https://www.coindesk.com/war-words-whos-said-bitcoin-fork/,"Bitcoin is abuzz with chatter about the prospects of a possible network split, a development that could drive the emergence of two separate blockchains. Speculation has grown in recent weeks that miners and users backing Bitcoin Unlimited – an alternative bitcoin software implementation that seeks to change the network's rule set – may effectively ""fork"" off the network, if not everyone agrees to migrate to their changes. It's an eventuality that has businesses in the industry weighing in again on a long-standing impasse over the digital currency's future direction. What's more, the nature and tone of the scaling debate appears to have sharpened, driven by animosity between those who support one vision over another. As such, a range of bitcoin startups (exchanges, wallet providers, miners and hardware makers) have weighed in on where they stand on the issue. Perhaps unsurprisingly, much of the preparation seen comes from companies that would find themselves in possession of handling two separate bitcoin assets on behalf of customers should the network split. A number of the statements, in addition to outlining policy, seek to assuage possible user concerns ahead of a split over the safety – and accessibility – of their money. In this feature, CoinDesk takes a look at what these businesses are saying about the possible fork – and how they’re preparing for what could become a potentially messy situation. As might be expected, those working on wallet projects have positioned themselves – and their policies – ahead of a fork. Overall, the positions in this sector seem to focus on ensuring ease of use during a potentially disruptive period. Here’s what those working in the wallet space have said thus far: The startup told CoinDesk that, in the event of a fork, it would let users manage two accounts, one for each version of the blockchain. ""Our commitment is to our customers and we want to ensure that they can can safely transact on both sides of the fork should that happen,"" CEO Darin Stanchfield told CoinDesk. Reiterating that hardware wallet users wouldn't lose access to their bitcoins, Ledger said that, in the event of a split, it would release a software update allowing them to manage both currencies. However, it was not immediately clear if this would be a short-term move. ""Should multiple chains prove to be viable in the long run, Ledger will update its Ledger Wallet Bitcoin Chrome app to add a BTC-C/BTC-U switch (in the same way that our Ethereum Chrome app has a ETH/ETC switch),” the company said. SatoshiLabs, which also operates the Slush mining pool, said on 20th March that its users of its Trezor line of hardware wallets would be able to access Bitcoin Unlimited tokens in the event that two blockchains emerge. ""Should Bitcoin Unlimited (BTU) split away and be implemented in TREZOR Wallet, it would be provided as another option in the currency selector. Therefore, in terms of the security of your coins, a little has changed — no action is required from you [and] your coins remain safe,"" the firm said, adding: Wallet software provider Samourai detailed its (albiet brief) plan for a hard fork potential on 20th March via Twitter. ""Wallet Users: Samourai continues to run Bitcoin Core 0.14. There are no plans to switch to any implementation that breaks current consensus,"" the team behind the software said. The open-source project said this week that it wasn’t taking a side in the ongoing debate, but outlined steps that users could take in the event of a fork. Circle detailed its policy change in an email to users last week, a move that came months after the startup did away with its bitcoin buying and selling services. ""This bitcoin downtime will likely occur immediately upon a 'fork' of bitcoin with little to no warning, and during this period of bitcoin downtime you will not have access to bitcoin that you hold in your Circle account,"" the startup said. In a 24th March statement, the team behind the Breadwallet wallet software said that it would ""continue to connect to the chain that is the most popular amongst miners"", signaling that it would support the blockchain with the most mining power. Notably, the team indicated its belief that, in the event of a fork, the smaller of two chains wouldn't survive in the long run. ""We expect the less popular chain to quickly lose support and be abandoned, which is why we have not invested a lot of resources into adding the capability to interact with both chains separately,"" the team said. Though the startup has indicated support in the past for efforts to raise the block size, Coinbase affirmed on 19th March that ""the only version of bitcoin supported on the Coinbase platform today is Bitcoin Core, currently represented by the symbol BTC."" Coinbase echoed other services in saying that it may be required to temporarily suspend withdrawals and deposits in the event of a fork. ""Customers who wish to access both blockchains at the time of the hard fork should withdraw their BTC from Coinbase since we cannot guarantee what will happen during the hard fork or when this access may be available,"" the startup added. The team behind security-minded wallet GreenAddress said that they don't believe a fork will occur; however, like the other wallets, they outlined a brief game plan if it comes to pass. ""We will always provide safe wallet support for Bitcoin under the original chain rules, as GreenAddress is server based and follows Bitcoin’s consensus rules. Users do not need to take any particular action at this time,"" the team said. Bitcoin exchanges have been among the more active in seeking to define their policies ahead of the fork, largely embracing the idea of creating markets for both BTC and BTU should two blockchains emerge. That said, a policy rollout earlier this month laid bare the complexities to which the situation could lead. Here’s what the exchanges have said thus far: A group of some well-known exchanges, including Bifinex, Bitstamp and Kraken, were the first to respond to a possible fork in bulk. The plan indicates that the exchange expect to list the two tokens as separate assets, while allowing for the market to determine any winner. ""Since it appears likely we may see a hard fork initiated by the Bitcoin Unlimited project, we have decided to designate the Bitcoin Unlimited fork as BTU (or XBU). The Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to trade as BTC (or XBT) and all exchanges will process deposits and withdrawals in BTC even if the BTU chain has more hashing power,"" the group has said. One of the more aggressive exchanges when it comes to listing new tokens, Poloniex emerged as an important market indicator. Notably, it signaled it would be more cautious in listing any bitcoin fork. ""We will support Bitcoin Core continuously as BTC,"" cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex said in its statement. ""In line with our current internal policy, if you have bitcoin on balance at the time of the fork, we will make Bitcoin Unlimited available for withdrawal provided it is safe to do so."" Poloniex also outlined how it would define ""safe"", putting forward that it would be incumbent on the Bitcoin Unlimited team to guard against replay attacks (a concern that other exchanges have raised given the risk posed to user funds). Such attacks featured in the aftermath of ethereum’s fork last summer when users were able to send transactions on both chains at once, leading to the loss of funds. In a notice, futures exchange BitMEX endorsed the earlier statement by the exchange consortium. Notably, the company was uncompromising on the point of replay attacks. ""BU will not be listed or used as a deposit/withdrawal currency until replay protection is implemented and BU is not at risk of a blockchain reorganization if the Core chain becomes longer,"" the company said. The Japanese exchange indicated that it hopes the split will ultimately result in one bitcoin, whether it's one that uses Bitcoin Core or the Bitcoin Unlimited software. Even so, BitFlyer plans to support both tokens in the event of a fork, while suggesting its services could be temporarily closed should this occur. ""[W]e are strongly against the coexistence of multiple blockchains that would result from a hard fork,"" it said. In its statement, Gemini was perhaps less decisive about how it would respond to a fork, writing that it ""may choose to eventually"" support the chain with less mining pool support. ""The ‘BTC’ balance and trading activity you see on Gemini will likely reflect the chain with the greater total difficulty,"" the exchange said, adding: Amidst the debate, bitcoin's miners – the entities that engage in a globally competitive, energy intensive race to add new transactions to the blockchain – have emerged as potential kingmakers. Here’s what some of the miners in the space have said thus far: In an interview with Bloomberg on 10th March, Bitmain co-founder Jihan Wu said that Bitmain’s mining pool, AntPool, would move to support Bitcoin Unlimited. ""We will switch our entire pool to Bitcoin Unlimited,"" he told the publication. ""We can’t tell how the hard fork will play out. We will only know by the time we get there."" The statement would go on to spark the largest, global discussion about a potential fork given AntPool's size and Bitmain's market position. In statements to CoinDesk, CEO Valery Vavilov said that his company supports the Segregated Witness upgrade put forward by Bitcoin Core. Vavilov said that it offers exponentially ""more opportunities for transaction growth"" compared to Bitcoin Unlimited. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to vigorously safeguard and secure the bitcoin blockchain that protects the interests of users and businesses around the world,"" said Vavilov. ViaBTC has long backed the Bitcoin Unlimited project, and in a 24th March blog post pushed for other pools to integrate the software. Further, the mining pool said that it disagreed with the idea of supporting two currencies with two distinct blockchains. ""If the current blockchain hard forks into two chains, only one of them will be the valid bitcoin chain, which means there will only be one bitcoin, following the principles of Satoshi's white paper,"" said ViaBTC. Finally, there's the startups and project teams that provide infrastructure services to the bitcoin blockchain, but that fall out of more common categories. Here’s what some of them have said about the fork thus far: In statements widely circulated by Bitcoin Core supporters, BitGo came out strongly on behalf of the project's existing development team. ""BitGo considers any hard fork which is rolled out without industry-wide consensus, and therefore splits the network, to be an altcoin, not bitcoin itself,"" it read. As a provider of software that allows alternative currencies to be launched on the bitcoin blockchain, Colu is perhaps in a unique position when it comes to the possibility of a fork. Ultimately, it reasoned that its customers would need to be clear about which infrastructure they would seek to base their service on, arguing they would need to select one of the two blockchains and communicate the choice to users. More broadly, the company said it doesn't believe a block size fix is a panacea for bitcoins woes. ""We are also confident that 'scaling' can’t be achieved by merely raising the block size, and right now the only viable solution we see for reaching scalability (and not short-term patches), while keeping Bitcoin’s features of censorship resistance , is moving transaction off-chain,"" it wrote. Similar to Colu, Counterparty is a top-level bitcoin protocol that seeks to enable asset creation on top of the bitcoin network. As such, while it lamented the ""increasing toxicity"" in bitcoin surrounding the debate, it noted that it would eventually have to base its service on one of the two blockchains (should they evolve into separate markets). ""With whatever happens, we will not be maintaining two separate Counterparty networks, ever, but we keep the option open to switch from one to another if we can form a rough consensus in our community and we believe it is in the best interests of Counterparty users and developers,"" the statement read. On 27th March, a group of Candian businesses and entreprenuers released a joint statement staunchly opposing Bitcoin Unlimited. The group said that they support the activation of Segregated Witness and opposed any hard forks that could result in a network split. ""Under no circumstance will the current Bitcoin Unlimited proposal be considered by the undersigned to be the original Bitcoin cryptocurrency as described in the Satoshi whitepaper and as currently used under the denomination 'Bitcoin' in our businesses,"" the statement read.

                            Bitcoin Rebounds From Two-Month Low to Top $1,000                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-rebounds-two-month-low-top-1000/," After falling to their lowest level in more than two months this weekend, bitcoin prices breached $1,000 again today. Overall, the digital currency rose as much as 7.5% during the session, climbing from a low of $958.77 to as much as $1,030.78, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At the time of the report, bitcoin was trading at $1,023.95. For bitcoin, the turnaround followed its decline to as little as $891.51 on 25th March, its lowest average price since 25th January, BPI figures show. Notably, the figure was nearly 50% below the all-time high of more than $1,300 that the cryptocurrency reached earlier this month, then fueled by anticipation for the SEC's ruling on a proposed bitcoin ETF. When explaining bitcoin's recent price moves, most analysts pointed to the the cryptocurrency's ongoing technical in-fighting as reason for the volatility. Should the bitcoin network undergo a hard fork, it could potentially split into two separate blockchains (each with their own distinct tokens), prompting concerns among less tech-savvy investors. Such an event could prove highly bearish for the price of both bitcoin tokens, analysts have warned. Investor and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham, in particular, has emphasized the sharp declines bitcoin could suffer following a hard fork. Concerns about the growing popularity of Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative software implementation and developer group that could push the move helped bring about the plunge, according to Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged digital currency trading platform Whaleclub. He told CoinDesk: Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, took a different approach by looking at market dynamics. He reasons that smart money simply took advantage of this market sentiment, as traders either caught the bounce and sold or shorted the currency pair. Still, the markets continue to be sharply volatile amid such moves, developments that could continue to stoke fears among casual bitcoin holders and users. Such choppy waters, those surveyed suggested, could become the norm should bitcoin's scaling uncertainty continue. Inflatable castle via Shutterstock

                            A Short Guide to Bitcoin Forks                        ",Amy Castor,https://www.coindesk.com/short-guide-bitcoin-forks-explained/,"If you have been paying attention to bitcoin at all lately, you may have noticed a lot of talk going on about 'forks'. Not like the kind you would find on a table, on a blockchain, a fork is a technical event that occurs because diverse participants need to agree on common rules. At its most basic, a fork is what happens when a blockchain diverges into two potential paths forward — either with regard to a network’s transaction history or a new rule in deciding what makes a transaction valid. As a result, those who use the blockchain have to show support for one choice over the other. Yet, there are many different types of forks, and the science of studying them is still new. So far, we know some forks resolve on their own, but others, fueled by deep rifts in a community, can cause a network to permanently split, creating two blockchain histories — and two separate currencies. Along with that, there has also been confusion about the various types of forks, how they get activated and the risks they pose. To clarify, we've assembled quick rundown on how different forks work. Before we get into the classifications, it's worth noting that bitcoin forks already occur quite regularly. A byproduct of distributed consensus, forks happen anytime two miners find a block at nearly the same time. The ambiguity is resolved when subsequent blocks are added to one, making it the longest chain, while the other block gets ""orphaned"" (or abandoned) by the network. But forks also can be willingly introduced to the network. This occurs when developers seek to change the rules the software uses to decide whether a transaction is valid or not. When a block contains invalid transactions, that block is ignored by the network, and the miner who found that block loses out on a block reward. As such, miners generally want to mine only valid blocks and build on the longest chain. Following are some of the more common forks and their traits. What is it? A hard fork is a software upgrade that introduces a new rule to the network that isn't compatible with the older software. You can think of a hard fork as an expansion of the rules. (A new rule that allows block size to be 2MB instead of 1MB would require a hard fork). What happens? Nodes that continue running the old version of the software will see the new transactions as invalid. So, to switch over to the new chain and to continue to mine valid blocks, all of the nodes in the network need to upgrade to the new rules. What can go wrong? The problem comes when some sort of political impasse arises, and a portion of the community decides to stick by the old rules no matter what. The hash rate, or network computing power, behind the old chain is irrelevant. What matters is that its data (and ruleset) is still perceived to have value, meaning miners still want to mine a chain and developers still want to support it. The ethereum DAO hard fork was a perfect case study of how a community can split over rules. Now, we have two blockchains using a variant of the software – ethereum and ethereum classic, both of which boast a different ethos and a different currency. What is it? A soft fork, by contrast, is any change that's backward compatible. Say, instead of 1MB blocks, a new rule might only allow 500K blocks. What happens? Non-upgraded nodes will still see the new transactions as valid (500k is less than 1MB in this example). However, if non-upgraded nodes continue to mine blocks, the blocks they mine will be rejected by the upgraded nodes. This is why soft forks need a majority of hash power in the network. What can go wrong? When a soft fork is supported by only a minority of hash power in the network, it could become the shortest chain and get orphaned by the network. Or, it can act like a hard fork, and one chain can splinter off. Soft forks have been the most commonly used option to upgrade the bitcoin blockchain so far because it's argued they present a lower risk of splitting the network. Past examples of successful soft forks include software upgrades like BIP 66 (which dealt with signature validation) and P2SH (which altered bitcoin's address formatting). What is it? A user-activated soft fork (UASF) is a controversial idea that explores how a blockchain might add an upgrade that is not directly supported by those who provide the network's hashing power. The idea with UASF is that instead of waiting for a threshold of support from mining pools, the power to activate a soft fork goes to the exchanges, wallets and businesses who are running full nodes. (In bitcoin, a full node, even if it is not a mining node, is still responsible for validating blocks.) What happens? The majority of major exchanges would need to publicly support the change before it could be written into a new version of code. After that, the new software (which has an activation point in the future) gets installed on nodes that want to participate in the soft fork. What can go wrong? This method requires a much longer lead time to work than a hash-power-triggered soft fork. In fact, it's believed it may take as long as a year or more to write the code and get everyone ready. Further, if the majority of miners end up not ‘falling in line’ and activating the new rules, they could use their overwhelming hash power to split the network. Currently this idea is theoretical and has not been implemented. Table setting via Shutterstock

                            Why Mizuho Believes Bitcoin Still Has a Future in Banking                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/why-mizuho-believes-bitcoin-still-has-a-future-in-banking/," Japanese banking giant Mizuho Financial Group is nearing completion of a pilot project that utilizes the bitcoin blockchain for securities transfer. First announced last year as a proof of concept (PoC) built with bitcoin's open asset protocol, the project is now approaching a possible launch, CoinDesk has learned. While details remain under close protection, the head of Mizuho's Incubation Project, Ikuma Ueno, explains that the experiment to transfer securities between banks has picked up steam since the company invested in Japan's largest bitcoin exchange, bitFlyer, earlier this year. Ueno positioned the effort to use the permissionless bitcoin blockchain within the bank's larger push to understand how all blockchains and distributed ledger systems, including Corda, Fabric and Ripple, can better serve its customers. Ueno told CoinDesk: Originally announced last March, the bitcoin PoC effort saw Mizuho pair with Japanese IT giant Fujitsu to build a streamlined financial system that could reduce risks related to securities price fluctuations and the solvency of counterparties. Bitcoin's open asset protocol (OAP) is designed for deploying non-currency assets on the public blockchain. The work is notable in that it coincides with a rise in skepticism among some that only permissioned distributed ledgers can be compliant with financial regulations. Japanese financial institutions have recently taken a lead in this push into public blockchains, with foreign exchange players expected to launch cryptocurrency products later this year. Ueno said of the bitFlyer investment: ""Capital gains is one of the objectives. But the other is to get in touch with the public blockchain."" Citing a non-disclosure agreement, BitFlyer CEO Yuzo Cano declined to comment further on the work. Still, Mizuho's bitcoin project is just one of at least three 'underground' projects currently being developed by its Incubation Team. In total, Ueno says there are now 10 projects at various stages of development using Ripple, Hyperledger's open-source Fabric platform and R3's Corda platform. Of the blockchain projects Ueno was allowed to discuss, he said work is being done in custody, syndicated loans, trade finance, KYC and AML and cross-border payments. The most advanced of these projects appears to be Mizuho’s work with Ripple to connect its global branches: 400 of which are in Japan and about 80 of which are elsewhere around the world. The project was initially delayed when Mizuho learned the four branches it selected for the project in Europe, Asia, the US and Europe required additional training on Ripple's tech. (Details about the test are expected in April.) While Ueno confirmed the Ripple system is providing real-time payments, he added there have been legal and regulatory difficulties to leveraging the technology. ""That’s something we have to overcome to implement,"" he said. Another project using Fabric to let customers send one another cash was described more as experimental. ""We haven't executed that to being a product yet,"" he said. In addition to blockchain, Mizuho's Incubation Project Team researches other experimental fintech applications built using AI, cloud storage and more. From its founding in July 2015, when Ueno was the first and only team member, the group has grown to 30 employees managing more than 80 projects, according to the strategist's own count. In the early days of his internal work, Ueno says much of the team’s time was dedicated to educating Mizuho's employees. As the bank’s internal understanding has matured, however, the work has shifted to focus on building relationships between the technicians and the bankers in the various departments to help conceive ways blockchain could make their tasks easier. ""This technology is like the internet,"" said Ueno. ""It can be used in any cases. That was the incentive of me getting deep in this technology."" In addition to being a member of R3, Mizuho was one of 42 local and regional banks in Japan to join the Japan Bank Consortium co-launched by Ripple and SBI Holdings. So far, though, Mizuho has opted not to formally join either of the platform agnostic blockchain consortia aimed specifically at Japan. Instead of working with BCCC or JBA, Ueno says Mizuho participates in more informal 'alliances' with Mitsubishi UFJ, Sumitomo and others.

                            This Bitcoin Botnet is Vying to Be Future of Secure IoT                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/this-bitcoin-botnet-is-vying-to-be-future-of-secure-iot/," Strong claims need strong proof, so when the founders of NeuroMesh described their bitcoin-based product as an ""unhackable botnet"", there were a lot of questions to be asked. Still, the claim has already been backed by such accolades as a second-place prize in the MIT $100k startup challenge and a shortlist position in the ongoing Atos IT Challenge 2017 – both of which lend weight to the credibility of the project. Founded by Greg Falco, a PhD candidate at MIT studying cybersecurity, and Caleb Li, an MBA student at the same institution, NeuroMesh is seeking to find solutions to security issues in the Internet of Things (IoT). The pair saw what they say is a gap in the market for a security product that would specifically work within the confines imposed by low-power, limited-storage devices. NeuroMesh's idea is to mimick the same tactics hackers use when trying to compromise machines in the first place – installing lightweight code that hijacks the kernel and then dials out to a command and control (C&C) server, adding the machine's resources to a botnet directed by the bot 'herder'. ""We wanted to create a vaccine for IoT devices by first installing our own security software on the kernel,"" said Li. ""It's like playing 'King of the Hill', so we become the only ones that can control the device."" One of the main points of vulnerability for a botnet is an attack on the C&C server, something that's often observed when competing hackers try to knock their rivals' botnets offline and commandeer the devices. NeuroMesh's solution is to send commands to devices secured by their technology via OP_RETURN codes in the bitcoin blockchain – code that allows for the transmission of arbitrary data (such as 'Mined by Antpool', 'Happy halving day' or in one case, the text of an encyclical letter by Pope Francis). ""That means we can actually send out a blacklist of IP addresses that these IoT devices shouldn't talk to over the bitcoin blockchain,"" Falco explained, adding: In practical terms, this involves a C&C server connected to a bitcoin wallet address which can sign transactions. In turn, IoT devices in the NeuroMesh net would run an SPV client which reads only transactions signed by NeuroMesh, and execute the commands contained in the OP_RETURN data. Because data is propagated between bitcoin nodes in a decentralized manner, in theory reading these commands does not give any further information about the location of the server which originally issued them. Dr Michael Siegel, Associate Director of MIT’s IC3 cybersecurity consortium and a research advisor for the NeuroMesh project, says that Li and Falco's work comes out of a tradition of research into secure communication between distributed systems. ""It's a clever use of a small piece of code that can run on many types of devices,"" Siegel told CoinDesk. He continued: Falco also confirmed that the uniqueness of the NeuroMesh offering is in finding a new use for existing practices. ""While what we're doing is new from a commercial standpoint, there's been several case studies of white-hat security researchers doing what we're doing to close vulnerabilities in a system,"" he said. Roman Sinayev, a security software engineer who designs anti-malware systems at Juniper Networks, is familiar with the concepts behind the NeuroMesh project (although he's not seen the software in action). Assuming the code is written without any exploitable errors, then the result would be a secure communication channel, Sinayev said. Further, he pointed out that blockchain isn't required to hide communications. ""[A]nother way would be any kind of P2P programme like BitTorrent,"" he said. ""You could also use many different proxy servers and change the IPs, or you could use some intermediate service – embed information in pictures on a public channel, for example."" Without having seen the code, Sinayev stressed that it's impossible to verify that the NeuroMesh product works exactly as described. However, he suggested that (as with all security software) best practice would be to have an independent audit once the product is finalised. On a similarly cautionary note, MIT's Dr Siegel pointed out that technology is not always the weakest point of a system, saying: Even factoring in human error, the bitcoin network has proven to be extremely resistant to malicious activity, and it's this property that Falco and Li are hoping to tap into with their IoT product.

                            Charts: Determining the Ideal Block Size for Bitcoin                        ",Willy Woo,https://www.coindesk.com/charts-determining-ideal-block-size-bitcoin/,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, investor, trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast. In this guest piece, Woo weighs in on the block size, analyzing the charts to offer a novel take on bitcoin's big debate. Ultimately, he finds that there's little evidence to suggest current network congestion is a fatal flaw.  Bitcoin has been operating for eight years, from the early days when we only saw a few transactions in each block, through to today, where blocks are crammed packed and congestion is the norm. One benefit of seeing congestion this early in bitcoin's life is we get a great set of data of the network under load. In this study, we'll take a look at bitcoin's transactional data to see if it points to an ideal block size (if there even is such a thing). The chart above shows the transactions per second on the bitcoin network over time. It's a log graph that shows exponential growth as straight lines, where the bubbles denote the size of bitcoin's mempool (think of it as a kind of storage tank that temporarily holds transactions before they are processed). Despite users complaining that the blocks are now crammed full, and that the network overloading, this graph tells a surprising story. While we see by Q4 of 2016, the mempool swelling to take up peak loads, the network catches up off-peak. The network is keeping up with exponential demand. Yes, we are seeing congestion, but no, we are not yet turning away any significant transaction volume due to this congestion. If this was true, we'd see this as a downwards arc on our log graph instead of our straight line. But that's not to say we aren't very close to the limits soon and our arc away from a straight line will likely happen in the weeks and months ahead. We can use this chart to project future transactional demand. Say, by the next block reward halving in 2020, we can expect around 20 transactions per second on the network. Having predicted 20 transactions per second by 2020, I'll now explain why this probably won’t be true. The bitcoin network is mainly used as a store of value, but by 2020, bitcoin's price volatility should be stable enough for it to be used as a currency. I suspect then we'll see a step change upwards as merchants start using it for general commerce. Something like the Lightning Network (which allows for nearly unlimited transactions for the cost of four normal transactions) would open new use cases such as microtransactions for the IoT. The two takeaways are that we can use this chart for predictions, but they will only be valid as long as bitcoin's use case remains the same. For now it's store of value, in future it could expand greatly. Users of the bitcoin network, and in particular businesses, tell us that fees have increased to the point where paying for coffee and other even smaller use cases (such as ad network payments) are not viable anymore. The argument is that bitcoin is losing utility for general commerce, therefore the bitcoin network is at risk of declining as payments move to cheaper, competing alternative cryptocurrencies. Clearly, we see that the exponential growth of transactions per second hasn't skipped a beat. This tells us the 'paying for your coffee with bitcoin' use case, though much talked about, was essentially a negligible aspect of the network transactions. Otherwise we would see a declining curve. The network is keeping up. It's core use case has always been transmitting and securing high values securely. As mentioned earlier this will change as bitcoin volatility becomes stable enough to be used as an everyday currency. We are currently in the phase of bitcoin as a store of value. Bitcoin used as a currency is a few years away, so we have time to work out how to cater for the orders of magnitude increase that would come. This does not discount the fact businesses are experiencing pain from high fees and slow confirm times, which we’ll look into further. Maybe a year ago, there was debate among miners whether big blocks or small blocks would yield them higher profits. Some were even saying big blocks would allow more transactions to be carried, and therefore more fees would be generated. However by Q4 2016, we saw the impact of momentary peak hour congestion hit the network. It's been clear that a demand driven market has emerged, resulting in much higher revenues. Here's a graph plotting the fees impact of congestion on the network.  As average block size hits 95% of maximum, the mempool starts ballooning, users start leapfrogging one another with their fees in to get into the next block without delay. As a result the fees start to hockey stick… just a pure vertical climb in fees. If you were a miner, solely motivated for short-term profit, you would want the maximum block size to be small enough to always keep those blocks 95% filled. You’d want to limit the supply of transaction space so the fees competition gets rabid. The optimal block size for miners is ""small enough to drive congestion"" Okay, let’s move on to the what users want – fast confirmation times, reasonable fees and good security. We've seen the speed of the network grind to snails pace at peak times. The graph below shows how long we are waiting for a confirmation as the blocks reach their maximum.  The bubble sizes denoting the number of transactions in the mempool just goes crazy whenever blocks are 95% or more filled, and confirm times just go vertical. Even before things get crazy at around 80%, the median confirm times start to deviate upwards significantly. It's important to note that the higher the fees we pay as users on the system, the more security we get as miners can afford to compete with higher hash power with more revenues. This becomes super important in due time as the block reward subsidy drops with each halving event. Currently, fees make an important part of miners revenue – 1.5 BTC fees vs 12.5 BTC in reward subsidy. At the next halving when the subsidy drops to 6.25 BTC the fees component will become critical to the security of the network. Thus, there is a ""goldilocks zone"" for fees, not too cheap for better security and not too expensive. My conclusion here is the ideal block size to keep confirm times from ballooning while keeping fees and security reasonable is around 80% of blocks being filled. So we have three results so far. The optimal network, based solely on the economic game theory, will need to balance security and miners revenue, speed, and low cost of transactions.** Given these constraints, I think the best block size would have to be dynamic, adjusting to network transactional demand to keep it inside the sweet spot as much as possible. The goal would be to keep the blocks at around 80% filled. At this setting, the median confirm times will be unaffected, yet will keep the demand driven fees market high enough to be significant for miners and therefore the security of the network in years to come. But, it would be still 4x cheaper than today's congestion driven price. In this light, monero's approach to dynamic blocksizing where the adjustment is algorithmic according to network load seems ideal. It would constantly be adjusting to keep the best balance between miners revenue, security and reasonable fees for users. ** These considerations completely ignore technical aspects of the network which others have covered at great length such as block propagation times and Great Wall of China impacts.

At press time, the average price of bitcoin was $977, a fall of over 5% for the session. Since the start of trading, markets had peaked at an average of $1,032.34. Bitcoin’s price also dipped below the $1,000 mark over the weekend, hitting a low of roughly $947, before recovering the following day. Prices revived to above $1,115 yesterday, but have again since declined. It’s not immediately clear what’s driving this market dip. One factor could be lingering concerns over the prospects of a bitcoin hard fork, which could result in two wholly separate blockchains. Still, sell orders now outnumber buy orders, data from BFXdata shows, with sells accounting for 53% of trades in the last hour and 55% of trades in the last 24 hours on the Bitfinex platform. The market move stands in contrast with developments from earlier this month. As of mid-March, the bitcoin price had stayed above $1,000 for over a month, its longest ever period above that level.

                            Keep Calm and Bitcoin On? Developers Aren't Worrying About a Fork                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-on-developers-arent-worried-about-fork/,"Amidst one of the more turbulent phases of bitcoin's two-year scaling debate, calm and collected might not seem like adjectives you'd use to describe bitcoin developers. After all, now that a sizeable number of miners are running Bitcoin Unlimited, a popular (and controversial) alternative bitcoin software, there’s been fresh ""discussion"" of a potential fork of the network (which could result in two competing coins). The community is in a bit of a frenzy over the possibility, with some traders liquidating positions and others fretting over a post-fork attack on the old chain. Yet, not everyone thinks that a fork will occur. Bitcoin Core contributor Eric Lombrozo, for instance, has taken a skeptical and calm view, arguing that the bitcoin community has seen this all before. The idea behind this sentiment is that Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, other controversial software alternatives that tried to move bitcoin to a new set of rules, have emerged and declined over the last couple of years. While supporters view Bitcoin Unlimited as the future of bitcoin, trumpeting it as a fork will bring it about as the prevailing software, critics view it as broken – an idea they say is bolstered by two recent bugs that temporarily wiped out some of its nodes. Others, such as Lombrozo, say that it's simply a twist on old alternatives that have yet to have an impact on the rules of the main bitcoin network. ""Nearly two years of hostile fork attempts. Same playbook each time,"" Lombrozo told CoinDesk. He argued that it’s ""not really"" any different than its predecessors, adding: From the other side in the debate, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun's view is the opposite in some ways. He believes bitcoin will see a block size parameter increase, making bitcoin competitive with growing alternative cryptocurrencies again. ""In my opinion, there's a 75% chance we get an upgrade to larger blocks in 2017,"" he said. However, Rizun agrees with Lombrozo that there won't be a split: Other developers took a different stance. ""I think there is a strong chance there will be a Bitcoin Unlimited fork,"" anonymous Bitcoin Core contributor BTCDrak told CoinDesk. Some developers have been taking preparatory measures, writing code that could protect SPV wallets, which aren't as savvy as full nodes at detecting if they're fed false information. To that point, people from both sides have said that they want a fork to happen soon so that the issue is over with, perhaps because anticipation has been high recently. And, indeed, some Bitcoin Unlimited supporters seem to be in a hurry to see a shift. ""Well, I certainly don’t want to be quoted on a date. We are early in 2017, if this does not get done in 2017 then the long-term damage will be irrecoverable,"" Bitcoin Unlimited president Andrew Clifford said. Clifford cited a threat from alternative cryptocurrencies, such as ethereum or monero, which he said will surpass bitcoin in terms of momentum if developers don't increase the block size parameter soon. So, while some argue that only one bitcoin will survive in the event a fork, others have suggested that, as the issue is so contentious, most people won't move to the new chain and Bitcoin Unlimited will spin off into another cryptocurrency. ""A hard fork is by definition an altcoin that the entire community decides to adopt as a replacement,"" Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr said. “Since most of the community rejects Bitcoin Unlimited, it is impossible for it to become a hard fork,” he contends. Still, most in the community want only one bitcoin in the end. It's just hard to get everyone to agree on which one that should be. Not everyone is on board with the idea of a shift to a brand new cryptocurrency with new rules, even if they seem to be minor changes – as evidenced by the past two years of infighting. So, people are worried it could result in some sort of split. That's why a fork has yet to occur, according to Lombrozo, and why he doesn't think one will happen this time around, either. In conclusion, he said: Stress ball image via Shutterstock

If implemented, the proposal would find 'Schnorr signatures' replacing the ECDSA signatures bitcoin uses today to sign transactions. By making the switch, developers argue they can decrease the total data in bitcoin's blockchain by up to 25%. For users, this means nodes that store the network's transaction history would see better bandwidth while using less storage to secure the entire blockchain. The post describes: For the project's open-source development team, the introduction of the signature change into the roadmap follows its prominent featuring at Scaling Bitcoin Milan last October. There, Bitcoin Core developer Pieter Wuille made an impassioned pitch for the change, while appealing to the broader community to help handle identified roadblocks. To implement Schnorr signatures, bitcoin would require a modification of its OP_CHECKSIG and OP_CHECKMULTISIG functions so that they can stack public keys. Today, bitcoin's current blockchain size is around 110 GB. Still, the idea is not without potential difficulties. According to Wuille, Schnorr signatures face a ""cancellation"" problem, an issue that potentially opens the door for an adversarial participant to subtract a key from the multisig transaction and eliminate one of the parties in the wallet. Further, according to Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell, integrating Schnorr does not require SegWit activation, though he said the controversial code makes the process easier. For this reason, the Schnorr feature is unlikely to be implemented until a decision on Segwit activation has been formalized. ""I doubt this would be done without SegWit, though it could be,"" Maxwell said. The comments come at a time when progress on bitcoin's scaling issues has effectively stalled, with developers pulling out of a meeting this May that would have sought to unite industry participants.

Released by ZeroFOX, the report categorizes these new types of scams, collecting data from the point at which bitcoin became worth more than 1 ounce of gold in early March. In total, the company said it identified 3,618 bitcoin scam URLs, which were shared on average 24 times per day during the observation period. The paper goes on to claim that curated bitcoin scam URLs had been shared over 126 million times in total. Excluding two major outliers, each identified URL was shared on average of 5,367 times since its creation. Of the scams identified, the first involves sending malicious URLs, the second centered on the phishing bitcoin private keys, while a third scheme, known as the 'bitcoin flipping scheme', saw investors be sent promises of irregularly high returns on their bitcoin after they paid an initial upfront fee.

The final scheme was classified as a bitcoin pyramid scheme, essentially a high-yield investment Ponzi scams that require a low initial investment.  The report further included a number of recommendations for bitcoin users. ZeroFOX advised bitcoin users refrain from helping anyone mine bitcoin, noting that cloud mining contracts historically underperform the gains seen by simply holding the digital currency in a private wallet. The firm also recommend avoiding transactions that begin via direct messages on social media platforms. Coding computer via Shutterstock

He told CoinDesk that he believes miners are ""profiting from high fees"" on the network, and that they stand to gain by delaying SegWit, Bitcoin Core's proposed scaling option. Blockstream is one of the largest employers of bitcoin developers. ""At root this is an economic question, not a technical discussion,"" Back said. Other industry participants are reportedly aware of the meeting, with former BitInstant CEO Charlie Shrem telling CoinDesk that he is involved in helping to promote the planned event as a way to resolve the debate. ""I messaged Roger [Ver] this morning, saying 'I implore you to go in person because no one speaks for Roger except Roger',"" he said, adding: Ver has been among the more vocal and controversial critics of the Bitcoin Core roadmap, going so far as to back alternative development teams and alternative softwares in order to fix perceived problems in its operation. Rumors of a larger meeting follow weeks of increasing discussion that the bitcoin network could possibly undergo a hard fork, a process by which its blockchain could be at risk of splitting into two separate networks (with two separate tokens). Further, it is the latest in what have been several past attempts to settle the so-called 'scaling debate' via in-person events, though none, to date, have been successful. In recent weeks, developers and miners have shown a willingness to back alternate proposals, a development that has prompted wider discussion.

The issue, the second of its kind this month, was linked to a bug in the alternative bitcoin software that left an opening for the attack, causing over 100 BU nodes to disconnect from the network. The erroneous code, related to the software's Xthin block architecture, was promptly fixed, and after the binary patch was released, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited nodes quickly recovered to pre-attack levels. At press time, there are currently 806 nodes running Bitcoin Unlimited comprising 11.76% of the entire bitcoin network. This figure is up from a low of around 650 during the attack, according to data from Coin.Dance. Yet, much of the debate on social media has since focused on questions relating to the capabilities of the Bitcoin Unlimited team, which is vying to release software that would effectively replace the standard issued by Bitcoin Core, the network's long-time development group. On 13th March, a bug that allowed BU nodes to be remotely shut down was exploited, resulting in nearly 70% of nodes hosting the software to temporarily be sent offline. Further, as part of the latest bug, developers opted to keep the changes private, initially only releasing the code's binary from a private repository. Tempers flared following this revelation, and were further stoked by the fact submitted improvements were not cryptographically signed by those who made them. Additionally, the 'closed-source' code changes appear to have been leaked via Launchpad. Coding image via Shutterstock

                            Fork Fallout? A Bitcoin Split Could Become a Legal Mess                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/fork-fallout-a-bitcoin-split-could-become-a-legal-mess/,"Should the bitcoin network suddenly split into rival networks, those negatively impacted in a shake-up may be unable to turn to courts for recourse. In conversation with CoinDesk, legal experts discussed the more notable claims that have emerged amidst escalating discussions about a potential bitcoin hard fork, a process by which a portion of the network could migrate to new software, possibly creating two separate blockchains – and two bitcoin tokens – in the process. In recent days, bitcoin's miners and developers have shown an increasing determination to back separate visions for the technology's path forward, in the process claiming that certain actions taken by the other party could result in legal consequences. On one side, miners have put forth the idea they could sue developers for changes to bitcoin's consensus algorithm, should it result in their inability to operate profitably. On the other hand, developers have implied miners could face repercussions should they act aggressively, or maliciously, to disrupt one of the two resulting blockchains. First and foremost, lawyers queried by CoinDesk reported that jurisdiction was likely to prove the biggest hurdle in any lawsuit, given the disparate locations of bitcoin's key participants. Stephen Palley, counsel at Washington, DC, law firm Anderson Kill, told CoinDesk: Andrew Hinkes, a lawyer at Florida law firm Berger Singerman offered a similar concern. On either side, he noted that courts are bounded by geographies, something that internet-based economic networks united by blockchains are not. ""There are only certain people that I can sue in a Miami court. The court has to have subject matter jurisdiction, and then you have to have the right person to sue there,"" he said. Hinkes went on to use the example of an anonymous developer named Voldemort, famed for his authorship of bitcoin's MimbleWimble proposal, as an example, noting that jurisdiction would be hard to prove if identity can't first be established. ""I don't know who Voldemort is. That would be a problem. A lot of devs are outside the US. If I want to sue a guy in China, where most of the miners are, I have to sue there,"" he continued. Still, lawyers surveyed reported a much wider host of issues that would suggest such legal claims would likely be byzantine, if not impossible, in practice should a fork result in any claims. In discussions, one trend that emerged was the idea that miners would likely be unable to sue protocol developers given the absence of a defined contract between the parties. According to Marco Santori, fintech lead at Cooley LLP, such claims would be barred, at least in the US. ""Purely economic damages, which are the only damages that I could imagine a miner would suffer, require that there be a contract between the plaintiff and the defendant,"" he told CoinDesk. ""I’m not aware of any such contract between miners and protocol developers."" Hinkes agreed that the lack of a direct contract between the parties would prove problematic, should a mining group (as an example) try to sue. ""This has all been done with the tacit understanding that these things can change. There's never been guarantees the consensus algorithm won't change. In short, they're going to have hard time trying to find a person who promised that,"" he said. Here again, Hinkes brought up the fact that, while developers can release new code to the bitcoin network, they aren't able to force anyone else to run it, meaning that proving such a connection would be problematic. Yet, there could be options. Hinkes perhaps offered the most in-depth assessment of this scenario, suggesting three potential ways that developers might be sued. These included claims of tortious interference (a process by which someone not involved in an existing contract takes a wilful action that disrupts it), equitable estoppel (a form of law where parties rely on statements from other parties) and an injunction (whereby a court would explicitly bar a party from certain actions). Of the three, Hinkes speculated that a tortious interference claim could have the most merit, though he repeated that jurisdiction and identity issues were likely complexities. ""By propagating new code, you can say you directly damaged me. But, you have to say that you had an agreement. If you're a miner, who is that agreement with? What about the investors? Who do they have an agreement with? There's some issues there,"" he said. Equitable estoppel, he reasoned, would break down should the party seeking recourse be unable to prove a defendant had a pre-existing position on an issue, and that the direct change in this position resulted in economic harm. Likewise, injunctions, he said, were likely to be similarly ineffective, as they would require developers to be found and served in a location that may be hard to determine. Of the two groups, lawyers surveyed seemed to suggest that miners were perhaps more likely to be held liable for actions, though they acknowledged this depended on how nefarious any steps taken could be deemed. ""It would depend upon what those malicious actions were. Merely moving hashing power from one fork to another wouldn't be sufficient,"" Santori said. Should the action be sufficiently malicious, however, Hinkes noted there are still roadblocks. Namely, someone from a law enforcement agency would need to take up the case and be willing to venture into its complexities on the basis it could be fruitful for future case law. He also suggested that precedent here is uncertain, given that it's a commonly held notion that a so-called minority blockchain (one that was small enough to be attacked and taken offline) is expected to fall away in the event of a fork. ""Any time you attack the property of another person you still have to prove and qualify damages. Does the minority chain have any value at all?"" he asked. Still, Hinkes and Palley suggested that even if the actions could be construed as criminal, jurisdiction would likely prove another difficult impediment. ""Let’s say you could convince a US court that you’re entitled to relief, aren’t most miners offshore, in China and elsewhere? It's not impossible, but it's highly unlikely,"" Palley said. Yet, some suggested that the right amount of creativity (and the right situation) could combine for an effective legal case. For example, BakerHostetler fintech lead Carol Van Cleef speculated that a criminal prosecution could be possible, depending on the financial stakes involved and the extent to which the parties were aggrieved by any outcome. Van Cleef said simply: Wire tangle image via Shutterstock

Filed on 17th March, the move is the first public attempt by an entity involved in the Winkelvoss Bitcoin Trust effort to push for a review of its 10th March rejection, a decision that followed three years of filings in an attempt to launch the product. If approved, the Winkelvoss Bitcoin Trust would have been the first exchange-traded fund to offer exposure to the digital currency to retail investors. It would have listed on the Bats BZX Exchange, one of the largest US equities markets. At the time, the SEC found that bitcoin's market was perhaps too immature to support such a product, citing a lack of regulation and the potential risk for fraud. Notably, the petition was filed under rule 430(b)(1) of the SEC's Rules of practice. According to the SEC’s website, Rule 430(b)(1) enables parties to file a notice of petition within five days of the ruling (or within 15 days of its publishing in the Federal Registrar), provided clear reasons for the petition are given. The rule goes on to state that the SEC, under this clause, may ""affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand"" the prior contested action as part of the review. As noted in the filing, Bats is now gearing up to file additional documents. The statement reads: At this time, it's unclear of how the objection might be received, or what the path forward may be for the proposed investment product, though the SEC may also decline the request for review.

                            Who's Buying Bitcoin? Demand Persists Amid Fork Fears                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/whos-buying-bitcoin-demand-persists-amid-fork-fears/," In spite of speculation the bitcoin network could split into two separate blockchains, demand for the digital currency continued to remain strong during today's trading session. The digital currency has mostly been trading north of $1,000 today, dipping below but rebounding shortly after, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Further, volumes at two of the world's largest exchanges, Bitfinex and Kraken, were robust, with figures charting higher than the 30-day average. Yet, given the possibility that the network could see significant turbulence in the event of technical schism, some market observers were left openly wondering why bitcoin prices were still high. At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,005.29, 20% below its all-time high, but up 142% year-over-year. So, who's purchasing the digital currency and propping up its price? Some analysts were left stumped. Jacob Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund manager, told CoinDesk: As for what has been fueling bitcoin's sustained demand, other market analysts offered varying explanations, most of which revolved around speculation and uncertainty. Some traders may be trying to buy the dip, as bitcoin prices have fallen, and observers reasoned this means there's the possibility of gain. Charles Hayter, founder and CEO of exchange service CryptoCompare, told CoinDesk that while traders are ""skittish"", there will always be people ""trying to catch the bottom"" when prices decline. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, provided similar sentiment. ""Most of the buying going on is speculative, as far as we can tell, going after short-term profits, opening and closing trades within a day to minimize exposure on this uncertain market environment,"" he said. Harry Yeh, managing partner of investment manager Binary Financial, suggested short sellers may be playing a key role in keeping bitcoin prices at their current level. ""Lots of people were short, and they have been covering their shorts (ie buying),"" he speculated. Others, he said, might simply be caught on the wrong side of what could be an impending correction.

                            Fire the Miners? Radical Ideas Emerge as Bitcoin Fork Talk Escalates                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/fire-the-miners-radical-ideas-emerge-as-bitcoin-fork-talk-escalates/,"Bitcoin is in a state of emergency – or, at least, the community thinks so. Tensions are high as bitcoin's long-standing scaling debate escalated this week, with some miners talking openly about forcing a possible bitcoin fork that could result in two competing coins. If that's not enough of a concern, some miners have even been discussing a possible attack on the old blockchain once they move on to mining the new one – dialogue that has prompted concerning statements from exchanges and other industry startups. It's unclear if either will happen, and others aren't terribly concerned, with some going as far as to describe the recent frenzy as an attempt at price manipulation. But amid all this, developers seem to be at least responding to community pressures, putting forth creative, if controversial, solutions, such as a way of making upgrades to bitcoin that depends on the economy rather than mining pools. Another idea is even starting to take shape that might be best considered an emergency measure should miners be serious about forcing a system upgrade. The thought is that, if such a subsequent attack were to occur, then developers could go so far as to propose a switch to bitcoin's proof-of-work algorithm that would hobble today's miners by rendering their current computer hardware redundant. While Bitcoin Core developers might not agree on much, they do have an aversion to forks without near unanimous support. This algorithm switch, though – recently taking shape into a more formal proposal called Bitcoin Proof-of-Work Initiative (complete with a website and a Twitter account) – requires one. One developer even called it a ""likely"" course of action, at least in the right circumstances. James Hilliard, a developer and technician at Bitcoin mining supply company BitmainWarranty, told CoinDesk: In conversation, Bitcoin Core developers stressed the fact that such discussions are exploratory – and that they remain unconvinced this threat of a fork is any different than similar efforts in the past. Still, it seems like efforts are underway that take strategic planning forward. ""Everything's on the table,"" Core contributor Eric Lombrozo said. The idea that bitcoin could replace its consensus algorithm is an older one, with Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr coding up a prototype for such a change last year. ""It’s nothing new, it's sort of the assumed contingency plan for dealing with miners going against the wishes of the users,"" Hilliard said. Further, the concept is common in other blockchain networks – for example, ethereum plans to switch from proof of work to an alternative further down its roadmap. But, its apparent popularity in bitcoin might be new, with recent events giving the idea new life. Developers seem to think, if miners fork and end up attacking the old network (as rumored), that this would be the right emergency situation to deploy it. A perhaps less popular idea, though, is that the network already needs the change. ""The mere existence of an entity with control of over 50% [of the network] is a problem warranting a change,"" said Dashjr. As further evidence the idea is evolving quickly, BitTorrent inventor Bram Cohen pointed out that switching the algorithm is possible with a soft fork – a backwards-compatible way to make the change. Still, despite support, it remains a contentious idea. Vice-chairman of the board at the blockchain technology company BitFury Group George Kikvadze went as far as to tweet that his company would hire lawyers to sue developers working on such a change. ""[W]e will spare no resources,"" he wrote. Others have called developers promoting such an algorithm swap hypocritical, since they've been opposed to such big bitcoin changes in other circumstances. Still, supporters see it as a necessary last resort. Pseudonymous Bitcoin Core contributor BTCDrak told CoinDesk: One mining pool leader agreed. ""In response to post-split attack with intention to kill original chain, changing PoW would be the best option at that moment,"" SatoshiLabs co-founder and CEO Marek Palatinus, who runs Slush Pool, tweeted. Indeed, right now, the impetus seems to be discussion of a potential post-fork attack, though whether or not the proposal will be put into play remains to be seen. Stepping back a bit, ETH Zürich computer science postdoc researcher Arthur Gervais pointed out that such a fork, if used, would only addresses a symptom of what he called a larger problem. ""[T]his doesn’t really solve the problem of mining pools or the potential to build ASICs. It would be a temporary 'quick fix',"" he said. Gervais pointed to experimental projects that might have longer-term promise in tackling aspects of mining centralization. SmartPool, for example, is a pool in the process of being built using ethereum smart contracts. Another paper outlines a new mining puzzle that could discourage miners from forming mining pools. Still, some bitcoin developers seem to want to send a message to miners in the near term. Hilliard concluded: Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Kikvadze’s title. This has been corrected. Alarm image via Shutterstock

In an email late Monday, Circle – which dropped support for buying and selling bitcoin in December, but still offers wallet services – outlined its contingency plan ahead of a possible network split. According to Circle's missive (which accompanied a lengthy update to the its user agreement), its bitcoin services could be disrupted ""for an extended period of time"" should a fork take place. Services interrupted would include the ability for users to convert holdings from bitcoin to another available currency on the platform. Yet, Circle went on to advise users to move their bitcoins to other platforms – or consider selling them altogether. The startup wrote: According to the language added to the user agreement, Circle indicated that the disruption of its bitcoin services could happen within a short span of time and ""until Circle has determined in its sole discretion that such functionality can be restored"". ""This bitcoin downtime will likely occur immediately upon a 'fork' of bitcoin with little to no warning, and during this period of bitcoin downtime you will not have access to bitcoin that you hold in your Circle account,"" the startup wrote. The comments are the latest the find representatives from the technology's business community weighing in on bitcoin's scaling debate, a years-long dispute over the network's future that has escalated in recent days.

In conversation with CoinDesk, a wide range of traders are reporting they are preparing for a potential split by pulling capital from the market or otherwise placing bets that the digital currency's price will decline in the short term. The development is the latest that stems from the increasing discussion about whether bitcoin could see a ""hard fork"", a process by which new software could be introduced that alters the existing rules of the network. Harry Yeh, managing partner at Binary Financial, a firm that helps high net-worth individuals purchase bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, said the company has exited the market in anticipation of volatility ahead. Yeh told CoinDesk: Tim Enneking, chairman of hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, an industry veteran who formerly served as a partner for a firm that had nearly 100,000 BTC under its management, indicated a similar strategy. ""We've moved almost entirely out of bitcoin. We don't think much is going to [happen] until the fork,"" he said. The comments come amid new attention to alternative software implementations such as Bitcoin Unlimited, the software currently favored by a notable contingent of the industry's largest mining hardware manufacturers and mining software providers. Recent weeks have seen a recasting of the scaling debate, with miners and developers largely backing separate paths forward for the network. As this initiative has gained steam, a group of almost 20 exchanges has issued a contingency plan, which details how they would handle a split in an attempt to allow a free market decision on a dominant software. Other smaller trading firms and individual investors noted a similar sentiment in the wake of recent news. For example, Vinny Lingham, an investor and entrepreneur, emphasized how important the scaling issue has become to investors. He told CoinDesk: This sentiment seemed to cross geographical lines as well, with major over-the-counter (OTC) firms and traders in China reporting that they, too, are taking steps to position ahead of what could be a period of volatility. OTC trader Zhao Dong and Zhou Shouji, operator of OTC trading firm FinTech Blockchain Group, both reported that they intend to short the cryptocurrency ahead of any decision. FinTech Blockchain Group boasts $20m in assets under management, while Zhao trades about $250,000 in the digital currency daily. However, market stakeholders mostly believe a bitcoin network split would be a boon for traders – who can make money ""up or down"" in the market. Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff offered a more optimistic point of view, noting how ethereum's network split offered investors both another asset and new trading capital. In the event of a network split, users would possess an equal amount of cryptocurrency on both networks. This is because their bitcoin private key – a string of code that grants ownership of the coin and allows them to be used – would be compatible with both the original chain as well as the new one. In Eliosoff's view, traders should adopt a wait-and-see approach. ""Most holders don't need to make any rash decisions after a split. By default, you now just own coins on both chains,"" he argued, adding: Image via Shutterstock

A Manhattan jury sided with the prosecution in convicting Coin.mx operator Yuri Lebedev and Pastor Trevon Gross. Both Lebedev and Gross had been charged with bribery and conspiracy charges, while Lebedev was also tried on bank fraud and wire fraud charges. No sentencing date has yet been set, according to a report from Reuters. Lebedev and Coin.mx operator Anthony Murgio were arrested and charged in 2015 after the exchange's closure, which operated in Florida and allegedly served as a conduit for cybercrime funds. The exchange was also connected to a string of cybercrimes, including a 2014 data breach at JPMorgan Chase which exposed the personal data of tens of millions of customers. Pastor Trevon Gross was accused of taking $150k in bribes for his role in using a New Jersey credit union to help the exchange process payments. Regulators later moved to shutter that exchange. Defense attorneys for Gross and Lebedev claimed during the trial that their clients did not know that Coin.mx was running an illegal operation.

                            Bitcoin Unlimited: Mining Power Should Determine Hard Fork                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-unlimited-mining-power-should-determine-hard-fork-outcome/,"Despite escalating fears that bitcoin could soon undergo a long and messy software upgrade, a developer group at the center of the debate took steps today to allay fears that such an event would be disruptive to the market. In statements to CoinDesk, the Bitcoin Unlimited software development team, one of several groups seeking to introduce alternative software to the network, said today that it is encouraging bitcoin exchanges to list whichever blockchain is backed by most proof of work as 'BTC', the common designation for bitcoin. ""We at Bitcoin Unlimited are promoting ... improvements to bitcoin's anti-fragility qualities through further decentralization. One aspect of this is removing central planning from block size economics,"" the statement reads. It continues: The statements follow a decision by nearly 20 bitcoin exchanges last week to clarify how they would handle listings in the event new software was introduced that created two competing bitcoin assets trading on two divergent blockchains (or versions of its transaction history). The exchanges indicated at the time that they could not ""wait for a winner to emerge"" given the pressures of a 24-hour market. In their statement, the companies, which provide buy and sell functionality for bitcoin, indicated they would designate the software versions powered by Bitcoin Core as 'BTC' even if Bitcoin Unlimited had garnered more hashing power from miners (the entities that add transactions to the network and enforce transaction history). While exchanges said the statement was meant to position the industry sector as one that is open to a free-market decision on how to define bitcoin, it is not been seen by all as neutral. At issue in the escalating debate is not only a technical disagreement about how best to increase the software's transaction capacity, but the ideological merits underlying such a decision. As evidenced by the letter and response, this includes disagreement over who has the authority to enforce any consensus on project parameters (including which project would win designation as 'bitcoin', if any). Bitcoin Unlimited is arguing that, since miners provide security to the blockchain, these entities should determine the outcome of the decision. ""Bitcoin is defined by the chain of valid transactions with the most proof-of-work,"" Bitcoin Unlimited developer Peter Rizun said. Still, others associated with the group suggested that they believe such measures are unlikely. Should most major miners migrate to a new blockchain, wallets, exchanges and users would follow suit, argued bitcoin investor and Bitcoin Unlimited backer Roger Ver. ""The first block that is bigger than 1MB is likely to be a non-event,"" Ver said. The comments put Bitcoin Unlimited at odds with statements from members within Bitcoin Core, the software program's long-time developer group. In recent days, some members of this community have stated their position that it is the so-called 'bitcoin economy', made up of users, exchanges and wallets that add value to a blockchain. Miners, they contend, were originally envisioned as mere desktop computers and never meant to be actors that forced decision-making or dictate the technology's direction. As for how miners see the events, that consensus is less clear. In statements, ViaBTC chief executive Haipo Yang told CoinDesk that major miners are still in wait-and-see mode, but that most are now considering alternative softwares. To date, major mining firms, including Bitmain's Antpool, have expressed a desire to run software that would signal for larger blocks. This has, in turn, put pressure on other China-based miners, as Bitmain remains one of the largest providers of hashing power in an industry that has seen rapid consolidation. Adding to the drama is that, since launching their campaign, Bitcoin Unlimited has suffered two notable software bugs, prompting discussion on the ability of the software to meet market needs.

                            Charts: How Bitcoin's Market Dominance is Being Challenged                        ",Garrett Keirns,https://www.coindesk.com/4-charts-that-show-bitcoins-changing-market-role/," Given its status as the original blockchain protocol, it should be no surprise that bitcoin has long dominated the digital currency markets. In terms of market capitalization, it dwarfs other cryptocurrencies. Its first-mover status and widespread adoption has (so far) given bitcoin the dual advantage of network effect and steep barriers to entry, keeping alternatives at bay. But there's evidence that this longstanding narrative could be changing. Recent infighting in bitcoin's development community has provided a rare chance for alternatives to stress their value propositions and even assert new ones (like being a hedge in times where bitcoin's future seems uncertain). This has led to an interesting, observable trend. While the total pie of the cryptocurrency market keeps growing larger, bitcoin's slice is becoming smaller.  The clearest illustration of bitcoin's network effect is the ratio of bitcoin's market compared to the market cap of all other digital currencies. The most authoritative source for this data is CoinMarketCap.com, which publishes its 'Bitcoin Dominance Index'. Its current value of 72% illustrates that bitcoin has its lowest percentage of market share since it started publishing statistics in April 2013. This analysis is by no means concrete, as bitcoin's share has dipped in times of stress before. The question now, however, is what make of the downtrend. As the chart above shows, bitcoin has seen a number of sharp periods of decline followed by reversions to the mean. But the data illustrates that the market may be trending against 'bitcoin maximalism', or the idea bitcoin will be the only dominant blockchain in the future.  Yet, it may not be fair to suggest that bitcoin's declining market share represents competition against its value proposition. The digital currency space is inherently risky, but bitcoin it is still the most liquid and well-known player in the space. As the chart above shows, however, alternative cryptocurrency markets are now providing better returns for investors (at least in the short term) For an investor, bitcoin's ROI is being overshadowed by upstart cryptos who valuations are increasing at rocket pace. The question for traders might now be, 'Why risk capital in the bitcoin market, when other assets are much more rewarding to hold?'  Yet, a major difference between previous declines and now is the relative strength of other alternative protocols. None may be more notable than ethereum, and its blockchain asset, ether, which has been setting new all-time highs in recent trading sessions. This surge followed the news in late February of a 30-firm partnership called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, and nearly two years of open-source development. Unlike many other protocols, ethereum has a clearer value proposition in that it is designed not to be a digital currency, but a platform for decentralized applications based on blockchain. With a market cap nearing $4bn, the ethereum is gaining a more liquid market that is better better suited for trading, and institutional firms are starting to notice. Also notable is the rise of dash. Though analysts have cautioned that they are skeptical about the asset's increase in value, it has nonetheless gained  200% in less than a month, cementing itself as a solid number three in the list of digital currencies by market value. It is unclear whether this recent bull run is a speculative price bubble or a revaluation based on strong fundamentals, but it could signal the market’s favorable view of a strong governance protocol and a payment protocol which features anonymous transactions.  Though the possibility exists of a future not dominated by bitcoin, this shouldn’t be taken as a negative connotation. Due to the fact that new bitcoins are produced daily, the total value of all bitcoin's has never been higher. While certainly some coins have been lost, burned or otherwise removed from the market, this means that more money has never been invested in bitcoin. But if one thing is for certain, the uncertainty in the market is having an effect, and creating opportunities for change. Chart image via Shutterstock

                            After ETF Rejection, What's Next for Bitcoin On Wall Street?                        ",Aaron Stanley,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-etf-rejection-whats-next-wall-street/,"Days after the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) was roundly rejected by regulators, this much is certain: digital currency investors remain in waiting for the asset's proper Wall Street debut. But, how long exactly might this be? And will bitcoin ever see mainstream market acceptance? Those are just some of the lingering questions that the tech's avid supporters, and industry analysts, are now left with. However, a consensus on sentiment is starting to emerge. In the aftermath of the SEC's decision, many in the industry are asserting that the rejection was more than just an indictment of the particular proposal. Rather, they argue it was a clear message that further maturation of bitcoin markets is needed before such a product can be offered to retail investors. Blake Estes, an attorney with Alston & Bird, argued that those seeking to launch similar financial projects aimed at retail investors will likely be destined for the same fate as the Winklevoss proposal. He said: Estes focused on the SEC's emphasis on ""fundamental deficiencies"" in the bitcoin markets, arguing any proposed investment vehicle will likely see a drawn-out approval process and rejection. ""I don’t see what would change in the underlying bitcoin markets so significantly in the next six to 12 months that would allow the SEC to get comfortable,"" he said. As the SEC's mandate is to ensure that investors are protected, observers emphasize that more work must now be put into building investor and consumer protections in the bitcoin ecosystem. Mark T Williams, a professor at Boston University’s business school and former bank examiner at the Federal Reserve, used the rejection to highlight his long-held criticisms of the market surrounding cryptocurrencies generally. ""This detailed SEC ruling makes it clear that more focus has to be placed on needed protections to stabilize and add basic controls over the bitcoin infrastructure before it will be investor-safe and ready for public consumption,"" he said. He went on to add that a premature approval of an investment vehicle without such protections would likely undermine the long-term prospects of such currencies and innovations in blockchain technology. Williams said: Estes agreed, arguing that the reasons for disapproval were due to deficiencies in underlying markets – and the fear of worst-case scenarios. ""The SEC’s nightmare scenario is they approve this, all this retirement money floods in and then there’s another enormous headline-grabbing hack where millions of bitcoins are stolen or something happens in one of the Chinese markets,"" he said. Still, given the swift rebound in bitcoin’s price following Friday’s announcement, another question being weighed is how much Wall Street approval ultimately matters to bitcoin’s legitimacy. ""I think bitcoin [will never get] accepted by financial regulators in any major way, and the reason why is that it's fundamentally against sovereignty,"" said Josh Crumb, co-founder of GoldMoney and a former commodities strategist at Goldman Sachs. Crumb added: Mati Greenspan, senior market analyst at eToro, voiced a similar sentiment, stating his belief that cryptocurrencies don't need SEC approval to gain legitimacy. ""Although bitcoin was volatile around the time of the announcement, the bounce back in price shows increasing confidence in the asset,"" he said. Nonetheless, observers reckon that successful operation of these vehicles could potentially be a bridge toward bitcoin being packaged more broadly for the public. Times Square image via Shutterstock

In total, the price of bitcoin has fallen $100 since 15:00 UTC yesterday, declining steadily to its lowest point since 10th March, data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index reveals. The news comes amid continued discussion about a bitcoin hard fork that, if executed, could result in bitcoin splitting into two separate networks with two distinct 'bitcoin' assets. Today's dialogue was propelled by major exchanges, nearly 20 of which indicated they are taking steps to prepare and safeguard user funds in the event of such a scenario. Despite the decline, however, bitcoin's price is currently in its longest period above $1,000, stability that has come even amid negative news, including continued uncertainty regarding China's regulatory situation and the rejection of a bitcoin investment vehicle last week. Bitcoin's decline also comes amid a string of gains by alternative blockchain-based assets, with ethereum's token, ether, and dash hitting all-time highs in recent trading sessions.

                            Which Majority? Bitcoin Exchange Accord Reveals Hard Fork Dilemma                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/majority-bitcoin-exchange-accord-reveals-hard-fork-dilemma/,"A newly released statement from major exchanges today may have stoked tensions in the ongoing bitcoin scaling debate – but it also revealed more about how the confrontation is becoming increasingly complex. Today, nearly 20 exchanges announced that, should a certain developer group take actions that would split the bitcoin blockchain into two competing networks, the network running software developed by Bitcoin Core would retain the ticker symbol ‘BTC’. Bitcoin Unlimited, the alternative option, would then be advertised as ‘BTU’. Ostensively aimed at preventing customer confusion, the move has already been highly politicized, with some supporters of the Bitcoin Core development team heralding it as the effective end of the Unlimited project and its particular proposal for redrafting bitcoin’s rules. ""Mining pools may signal Bitcoin Unlimited, but this letter makes it crystal clear that the economy won't accept it – the best outcome they can hope for is to have their BTU token listed,"" former BTCC COO Samson Mow alleged in a statement. However, to exchange officials, the move is designed not to provoke, but to be forward-thinking in how it safeguards user funds. (A key component of the messaging is that to list the alternative, the exchanges would require a guarantee that users would be protected from attacks). Further, major exchange representatives are saying that the statement does not mean that they intend to act as decision-makers. Rather, it's that they’re open to having the market naturally settle the issue. Kraken CEO Jesse Powell told CoinDesk: As noted by Powell, there remains an open argument over how to decide which of the two resulting blockchains would be the true “bitcoin”, and the role that exchanges would play in what could be a long decision-making. To observers, the debate has now evolved into one in which two communities, miners and the so-called 'bitcoin economy' (exchanges, wallets and developers), could square off to determine the future of the network. Yet that reality shows that while ethereum and ethereum classic, the most high-profile fork to date, was a divergence of two groups that wanted to go separate ways, bitcoin’s hard fork is predicated on one widely held agreement – that participants only want one bitcoin asset. “It’s my opinion that those two will eventually be the same,” Michael Perklin, chief information security officer at ShapeShift, one of the announcement's signatories, told CoinDesk. He added: Blockstream CEO Adam Back cited historical precedent for this idea, noting that during bitcoin's first halving (in which its rewards declined from 50 BTC to 25 BTC), some miners continued to try to elicit the former level of rewards. ""Unfortunately for them the economic nodes on the network automatically rejected and hid their blocks, so they stopped and rejoined the network,"" he said. This time, the fear is that given the ideological lines involved, the process could be prolonged. Exchange representatives acknowledged that a fork could be a complex process from an operations standpoint, one in which charting and historical data would be disrupted, and costly upgrades would need to be made. But today’s events also mark a major challenge to the idea that miners have a natural role as decision-makers on the bitcoin blockchain, one that was original encouraged by some developers. Digging further into this idea, a notable contingent of developers believe that bitcoin’s software was designed with a smaller role for miners in mind. After all, bitcoin’s white paper envisioned that mining would take place on desktop computers, not complex data centers. This view is perhaps best summarized by support for the so-called UASF, a recent proposal by which the 'economic majority' would drive miners to support opt-in code changes. If the exchanges, payment processors and nodes that participate in the bitcoin economy commit to supporting a certain version of the software, then miners will have to go along, otherwise they won’t be paid – or so the view goes. ""The economic power is much greater than the mining power, and if you have the economic actors pushing a certain action, the miners are working for the economy,"" Lopp said. Mow pointed to a list of companies that support one code change in question, SegWit, as evidence that miners are not supporting what users want. Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr went on to describe the roles of the economy and the miners as not pitted against one another, but presented the current debate as a refinement of this understanding. Miners simply have a specific role to uphold, he contends. ""It's not so much that one follows the other, but that miners are obliged to do what the economic majority decides.’ he said, concluding: Boxing ring via Shutterstock

The procedures are part of a broader effort by the central bank to standardize policies at exchanges and stamp out money laundering and other financial crimes. According to the report, the document details both a standardization of anti-money laundering (AML) policies and the establishment of a customer identification system. First-time users, the report indicates, will need on-site certification in order to deposit funds. Prospective users will then be required present identification at the time of registration. For customers doing ¥50,000 (over $7,200) in volume or more, a remote video certification will be required for identity authentication. The paper also stipulates that there must be senior management personnel responsible for AML procedures, including reporting questionable transactions. The new rumors come in the wake of the PBoC's January decision to intervene in the domestic bitcoin market amid what was then a period of heavy market volatility. Since that time, the interactions have seen bitcoin exchanges implement a number of new policies, ending margin trading and freezing withdrawals for digital currencies. At press time, withdrawals were still frozen across domestic exchanges. China flag image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Exchanges Unveil Hard Fork Contingency Plan                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchanges-unveil-emergency-hard-fork-contingency-plan/," A group of nearly 20 exchanges has released contingency plans in the event that the bitcoin network splits in two, creating two competing currencies. The exchanges are now planning to list Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) as they would an alternative cryptocurrency, according to the statement. BU is an alternate implementation of the bitcoin software that seeks to expand the block size in an effort to scale the network's capacity. According to the statement – backed by Bitfinex, Bitstamp, BTCC, Bitso, Bitsquare, Bitonic, Bitbank, Coinfloor, Coincheck, itBit, QuadrigaCX, Bitt, Bittrex, Kraken, Ripio, ShapeShift, The Rock Trading and Zaif – the exchanges would list the BU asset under the BTU or XBU tickers in the event of a network split, which they collectively say ""may be inevitable"". Other exchanges, though not listed as signatories, are said to be planning similar steps but have not signed on to this particular statement. The strategy’s emergence comes amid escalating tension among those advocating for different scaling directions, and signals that some are taking the prospect of a network split seriously. It also follows statements from some in the exchange sector that preparations for such an outcome are being made. The exchanges have positioned the policy choices as practical rather than political in nature. To the group, the strategy provides a means to organize a steady-handed market transition, one in which two currencies emerge that share twin transaction histories – and in which bitcoin holders are suddenly in possession of twice the amount of coins they had before. The exchanges said: Yet the statement reveals that the signatories aren’t ready to immediately start listing BU as a tradable asset, should it be created. A major concern among the signatories is the risk of transaction replays, or instances in which a transaction broadcast on one blockchain might be included on a second one unintentionally. This situation played out in the wake of the ethereum network split last year. According to the statement, exchanges want to see BU account for this risk ahead of any hard fork. ""However, none of the undersigned can list BTU unless we can run both [blockchains] independently without incident. Consequently, we insist that the Bitcoin Unlimited community (or any other consensus breaking implementation) build in strong two-way replay protection,"" the group said. ""Failure to do so will impede our ability to preserve BTU for customers and will either delay or outright preclude the listing of BTU."" The exchanges also solicited input from stakeholders as they put contingency plans in motion. ""We welcome any and all assistance that the development community may offer in reducing the risk inherent with such a pivotal moment in bitcoin's history,"" according to the statement.

                            Bitcoin Price Support Weakens in Dip Below $1,200                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-support-weakens-dip-1200/," After several days of rangebound trading, bitcoin's price took a tumble today. The digital currency's price fell to as little as $1,132.45 by 21:00 UTC, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data shows. This daily low represented a more than 10% decline from bitcoin's opening price of $1,259.60. This sharp drop – which represents the largest intraday loss since the SEC shot down the proposed Winklevoss bitcoin ETF on 10th March – contrasts sharply with bitcoin's behavior over the last several sessions, when it fluctuated between $1,225 and $1,260. After moving within that reasonably tight range since the start of trading on Monday, bitcoin's price experienced a notable increase in volatility during today's session, falling through the crucial $1,200 level at 19:00 UTC and then dropping through $1,150 at 21:00 UTC. Following this significant, downward movement, the digital currency recovered somewhat, reaching $1,171.47 at the time of report. The day's sharp declines took place amid high trading volume. Market participants traded roughly 48,000, 30,000 and 18,000 through exchanges Bitfinex, Kraken and Coinbase in the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC, compared to daily averages of approximately 33,700, 19,000 and 12,000 over the last seven days, Bitcoinity figures reveal. Both today's sharp drop – and the rangebound trading that was present in recent sessions – have occurred as bitcoin continued to face ongoing technical challenges. The scaling debate, in particular, has been drawing significant attention, as industry insiders have been unable to develop a consensus after two years of ongoing debate. As a result, the perceived need for a hard fork (or the creation of two separate bitcoin blockchains and tokens) has grown. While such an event could create far larger blocks with significantly greater capacity, market experts have warned it could also reduce prices notably. Diver image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's Scaling Debate is Devolving Into an All-Out Twitter War                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-scaling-debate-devolving-twitter-war/," The bitcoin world has been in something of a furore over an attack that, on Tuesday, took down most of the nodes running Bitcoin Unlimited – a controversial alternative version of the cryptocurrency's code. Though the exact details of the attack aren't clear, here's what we know: After a couple of bitcoin users posted the link to details of a bug exploit that could allow anyone to remotely crash Bitcoin Unlimited nodes, an unknown attacker used the method to take down over two-thirds of the devices. A 'hot fix' was released later that day, and by Wednesday, most nodes had popped back up. The news comes a just couple of days after Bitmain's AntPool announced that it would switch its mining pool to the alternative bitcoin software, bringing miner support one step closer to the 75% hashing power threshold needed to activate Bitcoin Unlimited's rules. Unsurprisingly, the event made a strong impression on the community, and both supporters and critics alike have been vocal in expressing their reactions to the event. CoinDesk rounded up some of the more popular responses on Twitter (admittedly a platform that might over- rather than under-state divisions within the space) to see how developers and other bitcoin commentators reacted to the node outage. For a general overview of the ongoing debate, read our easy explainer. Following the bug exploit, Bitcoin Unlimited’s developer team, which introduced at least one other bug earlier this year, was an obvious target for criticism, but other factors and suggestions were raised too. 1. Developers at fault Coinbase director of engineering Charlie Lee’s concern, raised in a tweetstorm, is what would happen if Bitcoin Unlimited were the primary software.    2. Lack of collaboration Others also argued that the code was not well-tested. BitGo engineer Jameson Lopp argued that only one developer reviewed the code change that led to the crash.  Another bitcoin developer argued that even a novice coder could have been the culprit. 3. Poor review process ""Mastering Bitcoin"" author Andreas Antonopoulos argued that, rather than blame the developers, the review process needs to be tightened.  
4. I don't always... Many accounts that are not associated with well-known, or known, people, also participate in the debate. One such unknown Twitter user added to the ""code was untested"" sentiment with a meme.  5. Mining pool confusion Chain product architect Oleg Andreev pointed to a comment from Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell suggesting that mining pools that say they are running Bitcoin Unlimited might not be.  6. Cover-up? Lopp, among others, pointed to one developer trying to cover up the crash.  Bitcoin Unlimited’s supporters generally took the stance that the software is a newer version and that mistakes are inevitable. 7. Core issues Bitcoin investor Roger Ver linked to a piece written by one of Bitcoin Unlimited’s developers about some of the bugs they've allegedly discovered in the Bitcoin Core codebase.  8. Satoshi's bugs Along those lines, Blockchain security and privacy engineer Kristov Atlas pointed out that bitcoin saw a number of bugs in its early days.   Further, the exploit could encourage new programmers to join the Bitcoin Unlimited ranks and help out, he suggested.  9. What about the attacker? To others, it seems like the attacker was getting off too easily. Whoever he or she is, deserves more blame, suggested Bitcoin Unlimited developer Tom Harding.  10. Strength in numbers Many argued that the potential fragility of individual bitcoin implementations is a sign that there is strength in having more than one version of bitcoin.  11. The ethereum approach On a similar note, Ethereum Foundation blockchain consultant Hudson Jameson, a representative from ethereum, a blockchain known for its multiple implementations, even jumped in.  12. Take a balanced view Last, but not least, Abra's John Light urged for less divisive discussion on social media.

House Bill 180, introduced yesterday by state representative Kito Fansler, will potentially bring companies that exchange, store or transmit digital currencies like bitcoin on behalf of a customer under the state’s money transmission laws. If approved, relevant companies would need to apply for licensure with the state’s Banking and Securities Commission. The proposed legislation includes an expanded definition of ""virtual currency"", including both decentralized and centralized varieties, and covering ""open-source, math-based, peer-to-peer- virtual currency"" in particular. Notably, the bill is a follow-up to a previous effort to change state law to account for digital currencies. HB271, which contained much of the same language, failed in committee, months after being introduced in late January 2016. The latest bill highlights the twin directions that lawmakers in different states have taken on the question of regulating digital currencies. One the one side, led by states such as New York, licensure frameworks have emerged that include the technology under existing or updated statutes. In places like New Hampshire, by comparison, state officials have sought to create exemptions for digital currency traders. Alaska State Capitol image via Shutterstock

                            'Super UASF': Could a Clever Idea Break Bitcoin's Scaling Deadlock?                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/could-the-super-uasf-break-bitcoins-scaling-deadlock/,"An experimental idea for pushing through a controversial bitcoin code change took another step forward this week. The situation goes like this: with a scaling proposal favored by bitcoin's core developers stuck in limbo (miners have so far been reluctant to signal support for SegWit), some have sought for more drastic ways to push its changes through to the network. That's where an upgrade process called a 'user-activated soft fork' (UASF) is supposed to come in. First put forth on bitcoin's technical mailing list a couple of weeks ago by the pseudonymous 'shaolinfry', the proposal outlines a new way of making upgrades to bitcoin. The idea is complex, but the gist is that, instead of miners determining whether the change goes through, the economic players (consisting of users, exchanges, wallets and payment processors) do so instead. It quickly sparked a discussion extending to social media about the safety of such a move. Though a new, and controversial, idea, it's grabbed the attention of many bitcoin developers, including JoinMarket developer Chris Belcher and David Vorick, co-founder of decentralized storage platform Sia. Then, this Sunday, shaolinfry, seemingly in a hurry to give his idea a spin, posted a second proposal. This one puts forth a SegWit-specific UASF that fits with the requirements of the current deployment. This means that, if implemented, it could trigger the new type of soft fork as soon as October. Shaolinfry told CoinDesk: Belcher noted that developers are now calling it the ""super-UASF"". Backing up for a second, bitcoin needs a way to upgrade its rules if it wants to add new features like SegWit. But, upgrading is complicated for software that’s worth about $20bn, and worries of how to do it safely – like, without splitting the blockchain in two – abound. A soft fork with support from miners is arguably the safest way to do so, since it's backwards-compatible and not everyone needs to update. However, shaolinfry sees a UASF as a necessary option right now. ""There has been a very dangerous myth circulating in some circles that miners can decide on the consensus rules,"" shaolinfry said, adding that the bitcoin white paper describes miners' role as limited to ordering valid transactions into blocks. Vorick, in turn, argued that SegWit is an optional upgrade, one that no one has to use, and has benefits for the ecosystem. He told CoinDesk: However, not convinced the method needs to be tried right away, Vorick stepped in on the mailing list to argue that a better way to implement the 'super-UASF' would be to first get written agreement from major economic players. When shaolinfry was asked whether it might be too soon to roll it out, the pseudonymous programmer said: On the mailing list, shaolinfry further argued that a majority of nodes are upgraded to bitcoin software that uses SegWit. Many companies have further upgraded their software to support the change, and several Lightning Network implementations, which are dependent on it, have cropped up, offering ""significant social proof"" that the ecosystem supports it, the programmer said. Besides, the developer reasoned, a UASF was previously used to deploy other upgrades without any problems. However, many disagree that a UASF is a good idea, with discussions raising a number of questions: How does one actually measure that economic majority? Is it really safe? What happens if the miners don't follow along? And some think it’s just too risky right now. PhD student Phil Daian, who works on cryptocurrency projects for Cornell’s IC3, called it the “worst of both worlds” in a detailed blog post analyzing different types of forks. His concern, which he pointed out is shared by Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr, is that, ironically, it puts too much trust in miners. ""If a single malicious block is mined, then you essentially have a chain split. And, if a majority of hash power is not enforcing the new fork, then it could be a permanent chain split where you essentially have a hard fork with the bulk hash power that’s not validating the soft fork rule. And then you have the hash power that is,” he told CoinDesk, adding: The counterargument is that miners would have no choice but to support the chain that the economic majority wants, at least if they want to be able to continue to sell the bitcoins that they win from mining. Vorick said more time is needed. ""USAF needs more study and consideration before we can be certain. I think it's likely that we attempt a UASF if the SegWit upgrade fails,” he said. All that said, he’s optimistic, even if SegWit never goes through at all. ""Bitcoin never upgrading again would be a disappointing result,"" Vorick said. ""But I also don't think that its spot as top dog in the cryptocurrency space would be threatened by that setback."" He concluded: Chainlink image via Shutterstock

                            Space & Time: How BitTorrent's Creator is Attacking Bitcoin Waste                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/space-time-how-bittorrents-creator-is-attacking-bitcoins-waste-problem/,"While it provides essential security for the bitcoin network, there is little doubt that using 'proof of work' as a validation mechanism requires an enormous amount of energy. Where once blocks could be mined by amateurs with laptops, the mining process now involves warehouses full of specialized processors that are more or less useless for any purpose other than mining bitcoin. Even ignoring questions of waste, power-intensive mining has inarguably also led to geographic concentrations of the industry. Because miners receive the greatest returns where energy is cheaper, areas like Iceland, western China and Washington State have become the dominant epicenters. The search for a system that would encourage the opposite of these qualities – generic equipment, non-wasteful work and low power consumption – is what led developer Bram Cohen to propose the verification of computer storage ownership as an alternative to proof of work. His so-called 'proof of space' is relatively new in the cryptocurrency world, but Cohen (who's best known for creating the BitTorrent protocol) has a well-earned reputation in the field of distributed systems, and, as a result, the community has already taken interest in the proposal. In conversation, Cohen elaborated on the idea, arguing that the proposal is a natural iteration of the ideas powering bitcoin today. Cohen told CoinDesk: Under the present system, computing vast numbers of hashes leads to a race to find the cheapest power supply and use it as efficiently as possible. According to Cohen, any alternative to this system would need to be based on a proof of something less power-demanding. ""The only other resource to use for that is storage. So, that results in the theoretical possibility of proofs of space, where you allocate storage capacity to do this stuff,"" Cohen said. Under a proof-of-space system, miners allocate a certain amount of their unused disk space to the network, with the probability of successfully mining a block being proportional to the amount of space allocated divided by the total capacity of the network. To be fair, this idea didn't originate with Cohen. In fact, a white paper by another research team explains how a cryptocurrency based on proof of space, dubbed SpaceMint, would work in practice. To briefly summarize, miners add new transactions into a block by combining them with values from a lookup of data stored in a space they have allocated for mining (the location of which is dictated by a random challenge). A large enough sample range is then used to prove the total size of storage. One notable consequence of using storage as a proof, is that it could democratize the mining process. Cohen explained: This means that the network as a whole can be viable, while rewarding miners at well below the market price of their hard drive space. Another upshot of proof of space is that there is no incentive for any actors to try and gain mining share by spending large sums on storage space up front. Additionally, the addition of a time element guards against potential vulnerabilities that occur when, as with the SpaceMint proposal, proof of space is the only requirement for mining. ""There's a problem if you just have proofs of space: you made it so that it doesn't cost anything to do mining,"" Cohen said, adding In order to prevent this, Cohen's idea is to use proof of time in combination with proof of space, specifically, proofs derived from a dedicated time server on which some time will elapse in between each period of mining. While not eliminating the ability to re-mine blocks since genesis, this would mean that there is no way for an attacker to catch up to the current chain – a provision that he believes has been left out of other proof-of-space proposals. At the moment, Cohen is cagey about whether he will put his own proposals into practice, but said that, in principle, alternative cryptocurrencies should be launched only if they bring something new to the table. He said: For now, though, Cohen would not say anything more. While it's tempting to read that as a tacit admission that something is in the works, only time – and space – will tell.

Earlier this year, the platform suddenly went offline, reportedly depriving its users of access to some 2,300 bitcoins. In October 2016, the bitcoin exchange told local media that its IT system was ""damaged by an external interference"" that resulted with the loss of a portion of its total assets. But while platform's operator said that it had notified the authorities of a potential crime, as of earlier this month, the website has no content. The Prosecutor's Office said in a statement that it is investigating the case on suspicion of crimes against the property of third persons. ""Injured persons who have not submitted a notice of offense can submit such notices directly to the Prosecutor’s Office in Łódź,"" the statement said. ""Written notices should, if possible, be accompanied by copies of the available documents or print-outs that confirm the amount of the incurred losses."" The cryptocurrency exchange was set up in July 2012 and operated by a Łódź-based company called Digital Future. In past years, Bitcurex had been victim of various hacking attempts that forced the platform to temporarily halt its activities. In March 2014, following an earlier hacking attack on the exchange, company representatives told CoinDesk that shutting down the site would allow Bitcurex's IT team to ""perform a necessary verification"". Four days after that attack, the platform resumed services. Polish police image via Shutterstock

                            Code Bug Exploit Sends Bitcoin Unlimited Nodes Offline                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/code-bug-exploit-bitcoin-unlimited-nodes/," Nearly 70% of nodes running Bitcoin Unlimited went offline today as word emerged of a bug in the software's code. The bug opened a vulnerability through which a certain kind of message sent to nodes could cause them to be taken offline. Nodes are responsible for validating the transactions on a blockchain, maintaining a copy of the transaction history's entire record and essentially enforcing the rules of the network through the code. The issue was originally flagged on GitHub by BU developer Peter Tschipper. Details then spread on social media, sparking widespread commentary from both supporters and critics of the project. That discussion – and highlighting of the bug – was followed by an apparent exploit that sent the node count plunging. BU developers have since moved to release a patch for the bug. During the attack, the BU node count slipped to as low as 252, according to cryptocurrency data site Coin.Dance, while data site Bitnodes showed roughly 265 nodes online at the time. In total, as many as 780 BU nodes were online prior to the drop, data from Coin.Dance shows, and as of press time, 240 BU nodes are online. To get a sense of the scale, roughly 6,100 nodes make up the bitcoin network's global ecosystem, according to Bitnodes. BU is an alternative implementation of the bitcoin software, which among other changes seeks to put in place a user-configured transaction block size as a means to scale the network. The software project emerged amidst the wider debate over ways to scale the transaction capacity of the network. BU has drawn both strong supporters and sharp critics, with some arguing that it provides a path to scale the network while others have criticized its approach to expanding the block size.

Bitcoin prices first crossed the $1,000 mark roughly halfway through 14th February, and reached one month above this level at approximately mid-day today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). During this month-long period, bitcoin primarily followed a steady, upward trend, making numerous attempts at breaking $1,300, BPI data shows. Shortly after the SEC announced its decision, the currency plunged, falling nearly 30% from roughly $1,290 to $1,022.68, its low on the BPI, though single exchanges may have seen sharper declines. At the time of report, bitcoin is trading at $1,249.64, roughly 25% above the $1,000 mark, BPI figures show. Mountain peaks image via Shutterstock

                            CoinDesk Explainer: The Bitcoin Unlimited Debate                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/coindesk-explainer-bitcoin-unlimited-debate/,"Depending on who you ask, Bitcoin Unlimited is either the future of bitcoin or a broken implementation of the software. One thing's for certain, though, the controversial alternative to Bitcoin Core (the technology's standard software implementation) has drifted to the heart of bitcoin's raging scaling debate over the past year. To summarize an admittedly complex debate, each side wants to increase capacity of the network, but they want to do so by different methods. In today's climate, running or supporting Bitcoin Unlimited is basically synonymous with desiring one such method: a tweak to bitcoin's block size parameter, set at 1MB today. Bitcoin's code is public for anyone to read or copy ('fork') for their own project. As such, it's possible for different versions of bitcoin to run side by side on the network. Bitcoin Unlimited differs from Bitcoin Core in that the block size parameter is not hard-coded – nodes and miners flag support for the size that they want. Then, it relies on an idea called 'emergent consensus'. ""An emergent consensus will thus arise based on free-market economics as the nodes/miners converge on consensus focal points, creating in the process a living, breathing entity that responds to changing real-world conditions in a free and decentralized manner,"" the website reads. In the case of the block size, the idea is that via the free market, miners will come to agreement on a block size. Though, users can 'vote' on other parameters as well. While a larger community has cropped up around Bitcoin Unlimited, there are a few key players. Investor Roger Ver has been one particularly eager supporter, even launching a small mining pool, Bitcoin.com, around the effort. Other bitcoin mining pools, such as ViaBTC and Antpool, operated by mining giant Bitmain, are also now signaling support. As far as the technical community goes, Bitcoin Unlimited chief scientist Peter Rizun is possibly one of the better-known individuals to generate ideas for the Core alternative. From outside the community, others, such as former Bitcoin Core maintainer, Gavin Andresen, have said positive things about it too. There are many in the technical community who feel the Bitcoin Unlimited might not be a safe replacement for Bitcoin Core. Some developers, such as Luke Dashjr and David Vorick, argue that the approach doesn't work at a technical level. One reason they give is that the software hands miners too much control over protocol decisions. (Some even argue that this is a key reason that some big mining pools back the effort.) Another, is that many developers think that 'emergent consensus', in practice, would lead to blockchain forks (the creation of different and competing versions of the network). Meanwhile, there has been at least one problem with the software. A month back, one buggy Bitcoin Unlimited upgrade led Ver's pool Bitcoin.com to lose 13 bitcoins when it created a block that was not accepted by the network. Antpool is the latest of several bitcoin mining pools to signal for Bitcoin Unlimited, but its support (while not new) is all that significant. Bitmain, its operator, has an outsized position in China's bitcoin mining scene (it's one of the only major manufacturers of hardware in the region), meaning its support is likely to carry through its business partners as well. Currently, approximately 2.5% of users are now running a Bitcoin Unlimited node, but some think Bitmain may have the power to influence this figure. Right now, this method of voting isn't active. There isn't a activation date or hashrate threshold put in place yet, but if users and miners begin using the new Bitcoin Unlimited rules, it could split off into another coin and begin living by these new rules. Some in the ecosystem fear that such a fork – if implemented poorly – could create two bitcoin blockchains, and two publicly traded bitcoins operating on blockchains with different rule sets. Correction: An earlier version of this article misstated Bitcoin Unlimited's activation threshold. This has been corrected. Image via Bitcoin Unlimited

New York-based startup SolidX revealed last July that it was filing to list a bitcoin ETF on the New York Stock Exchange, seeking to sell as much as $1m worth of shares. The firm raised $3m in late 2014 in a bid to sell financial products tied to the digital currency. Yet the SEC delayed a decision on that proposed offering in September, punting forward a determination until 30th March. As the agency said at the time: According to the SEC website, its public comment period will last through 16th March. (The proposal hasn't garnered any input since 3rd March.) The deadline is notable given the SEC’s rejection last week of a proposed rule change that would have cleared the way for a bitcoin ETF backed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. That effort, too, faced delays as the SEC sought to collect insight from potential stakeholders. The rejection of the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF – and the agency’s justification for doing so (a lack of market surveillance and broader concerns about regulation in the bitcoin space) – could potentially threaten the chances of a positive decision for SolidX ETF, as suggested by some commentators in the wake of that event. Representatives for SolidX did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Calendar image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Traders Weigh New Risks as Scaling Returns to Spotlight                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-weigh-new-risks-scaling-returns-spotlight/," With the SEC's bitcoin ETF rejection just days behind the market, bitcoin traders saw a familiar topic return today – the technology's long simmering scaling debate. After two years of debating the best way to address the challenges associated with bitcoin's 1 MB block size, the digital currency's community has so far failed to develop the consensus for any particular solution. While Segregated Witness is now available for miners and nodes to vote on, the proposal (one long favored by its development team) has thus far failed to obtain the signaling needed for approval from miners. This has taken place as the number of transactions on the network has surged, leading a vocal contingent of the business community to aggressively seek solutions. Yet, the situation took a decisive turn earlier today when Bitmain, the operator of Antpool, the world’s largest bitcoin mining pool, announced that it would switch its entire mining pool to Bitcoin Unlimited, a bitcoin implementation that would aggressively expand the block size. Following this announcement, analysts have grown increasingly concerned that the bitcoin network could undergo a hard fork – a development that, if handled poorly, could create two separate bitcoin assets. As such, traders voiced concern about the issue, with investor and Civic CEO Vinny Lingham stating simply: Among traders, the prevailing fear is that a situation could arise whereby one side is effectively able to enact a change that would find network nodes and miners split into two versions of the blockchain history, divided by alternative features. Such a situation is not without precedent. Last summer, the ethereum blockchain experienced a controversial hard fork, a development that resulted in a minority of users creating the alternative ethereum classic blockchain. Henry Brade, co-founder of physical bitcoin supplier Denarium, went so far as to advocate that trades liquidate their holdings in the event of such a development. ""If bitcoin splits, I recommend selling everything and buying back later. It's a trust failure much larger than MtGox. Big haircut expected,"" he wrote on Twitter. Lingham later expanded on his statement, espousing his belief the situation will end poorly should a fork occur. Adding to uncertainty is that the long-term impact of a fork is not well understood, though data from ethereum's two blockchains provides some insight. Amid this uncertainty, bitcoin prices have fluctuated within a reasonably tight range today, trading between $1,216.31 and $1,247.26, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,239.83. Bitcoin hedge fund operator Tim Enneking summed up the situation as one where various parties in the technical and business community are beginning to get ""impatient"" for a solution that would boost scalability. He suggested the market is now in wait-and-see mode, but that there could benefits to one technical solution winning out, as long as two bitcoin assets don't emerge. ""A resolution (regardless of who prevails) will almost certainly push the price to new highs,"" he said. This relative calm contrasts with the sharp volatility that bitcoin prices experienced in the last several days, as the digital currency reached an all-time high of more than $1,325 before the SEC's ruling on the proposed bitcoin ETF. Prices then plunged nearly 30% to roughly $1,022 when the government agency rejected the plan, though the digital currency has since recovered. Decision image via Shutterstock

Legislative language published on 9th March details how MEPs plan to empower financial watchdogs in the EU, allowing them to collect more data on digital currency users. What's more, it sets the stage for the creation of databases in which wallet addresses would be linked to particular identities. At one point, the language declares that, in the view of the Parliament, ""virtual currencies should not be anonymous"". The legislation, if finalized and approved, would also create the conditions for national-level financial intelligence gatherers to share that information once obtained. The draft bill – prepared by the EU Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, as well as the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs – states: The release comes more than a year after the EU Commission, the executive arm of the economic bloc, moved to propose measures that would impose anti-money laundering controls on the digital currency space.

After dropping nearly $300 within minutes of the news on Friday, bitcoin has edged up steadily over the weekend, rising to a high of $1,242 today. That figure is notably already $40 higher than the price observed at the start of trading on Friday, when bitcoin traded at $1,202 per bitcoin, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Given the high expectations for the ETF, even avid bitcoin traders are expressing surprise at the digital currency's quick recovery. Joseph Lee, founder of bitcoin derivatives platform Magnr, for example, argued that the development shows ""strong underlying demand"" for bitcoin. ""Even a regulatory announcement from a large geopolitical region now has little influence on a price set by a global market,"" he told CoinDesk. The development goes so far as to buck the assertions of a range of bitcoin trading experts and entrepreneurs, many of whom had anticipated a return to volatility should the ETF have failed in its approval bid. However, it may be too early to predict exactly where the bitcoin price will move from here. As noted by traders, major China-based exchanges continue to operate without the ability for users to withdraw funds, which may be depressing overall activity and elevating prices. Others suggested that, once resumed, bitcoin's price could trend higher, as traders seek to place positions ahead of what could be a prolonged rally. Honeybadger image via Shutterstock

                            Using Google Trends to Estimate Bitcoin's User Growth                        ",Willy Woo,https://www.coindesk.com/using-google-trends-estimate-bitcoins-user-growth/,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast. In this guest piece, Woo discusses bitcoin's overall growth as a technology, arguing that by using common search tools, insights can be gleaned about its adoption rate.  Google Trends is a great tool for reporting search trends over time. As I covered previously, you can use it to detect bitcoin price bubbles, and all sorts of interesting data that can inform trading strategies. With this in mind, I thought I'd use this tool to investigate the growth of active users of bitcoin. For this, we again examine the search term 'BTC USD'. If you're an active bitcoin user, it's likely you'll be checking the price periodically, and a proportion of users type 'BTC USD' into Google to do just that. In this way, I'd argue we can use the search term as an effective proxy for the growth and engagement of active bitcoin users over time. From the chart above, we can see that the bitcoin user base is in a period of exponential growth.  What we have here is a steady exponential growth baseline with periodic peaks. As covered before, these peaks are are inline with price bubbles, periods where more users head online to check the value of their wealth. Taking readings from the baseline shows an order of magnitude of growth every 3.375 years. Or, expressed in terms of time, the user base doubles approximately every 12 months. (In honor of Moore's Law, I propose calling this Woo's Law of bitcoin user growth.) But what to make of our new law? Extrapolating further, it's possible to use this as a proxy for bitcoin's overall adoption as a technology, using other disruptive tech as a basis point. For example, there's expected to be 10 billion people on this planet by 2050. If we assume the active user count of bitcoin today is 10 million, 1,000-times growth is needed to reach 100% coverage. At current pace, that would take 10 years. Yet, in the real world all adoption curves follow an 'S' pattern.  If we were to assume bitcoin’s adoption curve will be a symmetric S-curve, we should reach 50% adoption in nine more years. However, to complete the last half of the 'S' will take 17 more years – 26 years from today, or roughly one human generation. Will today's children transact in a world where everyone uses bitcoin? We shall see, but the charts tell their own story. Pilot baby image via Shutterstock; Charts via Willy Woo

                            Nobody Understands Bitcoin (And That's OK)                        ",Jameson Lopp,https://www.coindesk.com/nobody-understands-bitcoin-thats-ok/,"Jameson Lopp is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of statoshi.info and founder of bitcoinsig.com. In this guest feature, Lopp provides a deep dive into whether bitcoin can truly be understood as a technology, coming up with more questions than answers and delivering an impassioned appeal to open-mindedness and exploration.  When I first became interested in bitcoin, I found myself spending countless hours absorbing as much information about it as possible, trying to put all of the pieces together. After years of learning, I now devote a fair amount of my time trying to help others understand bitcoin better. While many people have referred to me as a ""bitcoin expert,"" I still consider myself a student – I have yet to determine how deep the rabbit hole goes. Andreas Antonopoulos had this to say about explaining (and thus understanding) bitcoin: With enough studying you can teach yourself how bitcoin currently works from a technical standpoint. I maintain a list of educational resources that is sufficient to keep anyone busy for several months in pursuit of this goal. However, this approach of information ingestion will only expose the tip of the bitcoin iceberg. Meltem Demirors posted a chart that’s spot on:  One challenge to understanding bitcoin is that it is a multifaceted cross-disciplinary system that is constantly evolving. Ferdinando Ametrano put it well:  Ferdinando hits a key point that I’ll be delving into – bitcoin is not just a technology; it's a technology that represents something even less tangible. Bitcoin is a living protocol that emerges from a melting pot of ideas, philosophies, cultures and politics after they undergo trial by fire. You can read the ""Rise of the Cypherpunks"" to learn how we came to be where we are today. Even Satoshi didn’t fully understand what he built with regard to bitcoin’s security model. He (or she) ended up fixing a multitude of bugs in the first few years of bitcoin’s existence. After it was 18 months old, the rate of bug fixes had slowed down to the point that new vulnerabilities were categorized and documented. Let's cover a few of the flaws that were fixed before bitcoin gained adopters. In the first versions of bitcoin, anyone could spend anyone else’s coins: Satoshi fixed a major consensus flaw by changing the 'best chain' logic from using the longest chain to using the chain with most proof-of-work. Technically, it could be argued that this was a hard fork, though it didn’t actually cause a chain fork because the longest chain at the time was also the one with the most proof-of-work. Satoshi also set the block-size limit as protection against denial-of-service attacks. The block size was originally only implicitly limited by the network message size of 32MB. There is also a bug in OP_CHECKMULTISIG that exists to this day. It’s mentioned in BIP-011: – Gavin Andresen And who could forget the value overflow bug that allowed someone to create 184 billion bitcoins! In my quest to find more early Satoshi bugs that aren't well-known, Greg Maxwell recalled a juicy one: Researchers have also discovered some flaws in Satoshi's white paper regarding the description of the system's security. For example, there are issues of 'miner luck' and 'selfish mining'. There is even a compilation of known problems with the white paper available here. Bitcoin clearly didn’t follow a 'code is law' view, but rather 'Satoshi’s vision is law' given that he made a number of tweaks in the first few years as it was discovered that the code didn’t fully align with the intent of the code creator. I think this distinction is particularly relevant given that: a) Satoshi stopped contributing to bitcoin many years ago, and b) bitcoin has no formal specification. You can tell how little bitcoin is understood simply by the vast amount of research being done to analyze and improve upon it.  Satoshi once stated that the core design was set in stone and other implementations would be a menace to the network. People often take this quote (and others from Satoshi) and use it to fallaciously argue (via appeal to authority) that the bitcoin protocol must evolve in a specific way. I pose to you that this was just another case where Satoshi was mistaken. As we’ve seen, Satoshi actually had to make a lot of changes to bitcoin as early developers were exploring the code and discovering edge cases. There are also over half a dozen bitcoin client implementations running today that aren't disrupting the network. We have even seen that a single implementation can be a menace to the network when machine-level differences can cause consensus failure, as happened in 2013 with the Berkeley DB chain fork. Recall my earlier description of bitcoin being the result of a melting pot of contributions. This really took hold once Satoshi released his pet project that he had been working on in secret for several years. The very first week that bitcoin launched, it also gained its first collaborator, Hal Finney. Hal was one of the few people who believed early on that bitcoin could actually work, which is clear from Satoshi's original white paper release: Finney released a number of his emails with Satoshi to the Wall Street Journal; they’re an interesting read. You can see Satoshi's surprise as he manages to find several bugs that Satoshi had not anticipated even though he had ""tested heavily"". Unlike some systems (such as ethereum), bitcoin doesn't have a formal specification. Even if bitcoin did have one, it wouldn't be any easier or harder to make changes to the protocol from a technical standpoint, though it might from a social standpoint. As Charlie Lee noted in response to Andresen’s suggested definition, it’s amorphous:  Nor is there an objective process by which changes are enacted:  Paul Stzorc spoke about making objective decisions with bitcoin development, but it’s far from being realized. His presentation was based upon this blog post.  I pose to you that bitcoin’s strength comes not from being the embodiment of some dogmatic beliefs of immutability, decentralization or other buzzwords, but from collaboration. The process of taking collaboration and using it to determine human consensus can be noisy and messy, but it’s the governance model within which we must work. As I see it, this system of governance, rooted in voluntaryism, is the only aspect of bitcoin that is 'set in stone'. Sergej Kotliar penned this piece years ago describing why bitcoin has similarities to religion. As he notes, there is a bit of magic to the fact that the system works as a whole, because it relies upon non-technical components. The well-aligned incentives of the system form an ""invisible hand"" that guides it. Most bitcoin users probably don't realize it, but they are subscribing to a sophisticated subjectivist ontology by participating in this collectively reinforced belief in the system of rules that comprises bitcoin. To put it in simpler terms:  While bitcoin can be described as trustless in the sense that a full node operator needs not trust any other participants on the network, at a meta level there is often some form of trust involved. For example, almost none of bitcoin’s users actually read and understand the software and the protocol itself. They are trusting the developers to be careful not to introduce flaws. It appears to me that the fact that few people have a deep understanding of bitcoin's technical operations results in people with lesser understanding deciding which 'experts' to trust. As such, when experts clash, the crowd divides and takes sides behind the experts whose arguments they find most compelling. Unfortunately, this means that sometimes politics are injected into the decision making process. As Shaolin Fry recently noted, we should strive to avoid politicization of proposed protocol improvements. To be clear, this doesn't mean 'nobody in the ecosystem is motivated by political ideals'. Rather, it means that the direction of the system is not driven by politics in which one group of people forces their beliefs upon another. For example, the concept of 'voting' generally means that a political process is occurring. We should instead strive for a system of permissionless innovation wherein participants can signal that they want to interact in certain ways, regardless of what other participants signal. Some bitcoin users achieve such a sufficient understanding of the protocol that they begin to envision potential improvements, at which point they try to change the system to better fit their perspective. This is a 'command and control' mindset that is human nature; I myself have been guilty of making this same mistake in the past by trying to project my perspective onto bitcoin rather than ingesting the perspectives of the community. There are far more considerations that go into debates about bitcoin's evolution than just the technical aspects of how changes would affect the network. Ryan X Charles covered the high-level philosophies of the two most popular viewpoints in the scaling debates. Much of the contention in these debates comes from: a) different priorities and b) different beliefs in the use cases for bitcoin. Unfortunately, a significant portion of participants in these debates have taken their perspectives and developed them to the point of dogmatic belief, which makes it nearly impossible to engage in intellectual discourse.  One reason I believe that it is easy for people to project their perspective upon bitcoin is due to its lack of specification and thus lack of clear objectives. For example, Satoshi described bitcoin as a 'peer-to-peer electronic cash system'. But even this simple description can easily be interpreted in many ways. 'Peer-to-peer' provides no context around how many peers there should be; 'cash' provides no context around what the speed or cost of transactions should be. Much as you can find a variety of perspectives and interpretations of the US Constitution or the Bible or the Quran, so can the writings of Satoshi be interpreted and debated. The projection of individual perspectives onto bitcoin has led to the same sort of fracturing we can observe in political, philosophical, and religious systems. A group starts out on mostly the same page, but then an issue arises about which the group can not form a consensus. The individuals begin to polarize their perspectives and support actions that foster tribalism. Party lines are drawn, litmus tests are applied to newcomers, dissenting speech is suppressed, propaganda is perpetuated, communications break down, and echo chambers are formed.  As a result, today, bitcoin debates often devolve into fallacious assertions and name calling, where one party considers the other party to be either ignorant or malicious. This is unfortunate because people often end up talking past each other under the assumption that they are right and the other party is wrong. It's troubling to see the ossification of perspectives into dogmatic beliefs that degrade the quality of discourse in the community. I pose to you that there is no single 'correct' approach to viewing bitcoin, but rather a multitude of perspectives. The diversity of perspectives and use cases was the topic of one of the first articles I ever wrote about bitcoin. I’m not saying that you have to agree with rhetoric propagated by people with conflicting perspectives of what bitcoin should be. I will suggest, however, that you should recognize it as such – not as a malicious attack that you must defend against with a direct counterattack. If a debate is becoming too heated and discourse is breaking down, you can always disengage. Keep in mind that all humans fall prey to biases; we can't avoid being affected by them, but we can consciously choose how we respond to other biased people. It may also help to remember that bitcoin doesn't need you to defend it – you defend your own perspective of bitcoin by choosing which software to run and by choosing the system in which you store your money. Andreas once spoke about the ""noisy"" scaling debate. While it can be unpleasant, we should remember that it is the result of a feature rather than of a flaw in bitcoin.  Bitcoin ecosystem participants should be humble when discussing it rather than confident that our understanding of the system is superior to that of others participating in a discussion. I, for one, have found my conversations to be more productive after making this realization. I've also wasted a lot less time by avoiding conversations that were clearly going to be unproductive due to the dogmatic views expressed by the other party. You can achieve the 'Tao of Bitcoin' by accepting that bitcoin is on its own path that is outside of your control. Don’t be frustrated if your vision of bitcoin does not align with that of other users. Bitcoin will naturally converge upon the least common denominator of human consensus – that which is beneficial (or at least not harmful) to the greatest subset of participants. The Tao of Bitcoin is not understanding bitcoin, it is accepting that bitcoin is what it is.   I’ve attempted to present sufficient evidence that bitcoin defies conventional educational approaches and even defies self-professed authorities who claim to understand it. The result can be bewildering, but there is no need for negativity. We should remain hopeful that bitcoin will continue to 'fail to scale' just like the internet has.  Jimmy Song also made a great case for optimism in the face of deadlock and despair. I will continue my quest to consume as much information as possible about this new ecosystem, but have long since given up the goal of understanding bitcoin. The faster I run toward the finish line, the further it moves away from me. While some people in this space are more confident than others about its future direction, the truth is that we're blazing new trails and learning as we move forward. You don’t understand bitcoin, and that’s OK – neither does anyone else.  Author's note: Thanks to the many people with a wide variety of perspectives who provided feedback on this article.

In this guest piece, Woo discusses the recent run-up in bitcoin price, and the methods he uses to determine if and when bitcoin is overvalued.  Simply put, Google Trends is a great way to track the growth of active bitcoin users. The search 'BTC USD' serves as a proxy for the engagement of active bitcoin users as they check the daily price. In the chart above, the baseline denotes the exponential growth of active users, while the height above the line illustrates their engagement levels. When engagement levels run high, bitcoin users are in party mode, checking the price daily of their precious coin. If engagement levels are too high, that's when we are in a price bubble, and it's a good time to sell. Here's that graph again with the 'bubble zone' drawn:  Conversely, when engagement is at a low (marked with green dots), this is a good time to buy. Put together, Google Trends is a pretty reliable buy and sell indicator. So, what does this say about the recent run-up in price? Here, we can see bitcoin is not in a bubble, and that there is likely still plenty of room for our current bull run to continue.

                            Industry Speaks Out in Aftermath of Bitcoin ETF Rejection                        ",Michael del Castillo & Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/industry-speaks-aftermath-secs-bitcoin-etf-rejection/,"The US Securities and Exchange Commission has rejected an effort to list the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF (COIN), prompting comment from many of those who watched and waited for the decision. Reactions to the news were, as can be expected, mixed. Markets, having hit a new all-time high of roughly $1,325 prior to the decision, fell sharply before recovering above $1,100. Some observers deemed it a setback for bitcoin, while others, by comparison, said that it wouldn't have any long-term impact. When reached for comment, Tyler Winklevoss struck an optimistic note, telling CoinDesk that more engagement with the agency would follow. He said in a statement: Also striking a positive note was Spencer Bogart, head of research for Blockchain Capital. Bogart told CoinDesk that he thinks the rejection to the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF will have no impact on bitcoin’s ""compelling fundamental growth story"". However, he argued that the decision dampens the chances that the SEC will approve other bitcoin-tied financial products, deeming their likelihood ""extremely low"". Bogart said: Others took a more critical position in light of the exchange's reasoning behind its decision. In a 38-page document, the agency pointed to a lack of surveillance in the global bitcoin market, as well as an overall lack of regulation that it posited could spur investor fraud. Yet Jerry Brito, executive director of the non-profit Coin Center, argued that the decision ""creates a chicken and egg problem"" in which roadblocks to new financial products hinder the kind of development needed to address those concerns. Brito explained: Charles Hayter, CEO and founder of cryptocurrency data site CryptoCompare, told CoinDesk that the rejected bitcoin ETF application, had ""dashed"" the ""hopes that bitcoin would move towards mainstream finance"". At the same time, Hayter went on to say that the SEC's decision doesn't preclude the launch of other bitcoin exchange-traded products. Sweden, for example, is home to the Bitcoin Tracker One exchange product. “Whether other jurisdictions will allow a Bitcoin ETF remains to be seen,"" said Hayter. ""But for the time being all is not well – and it seems as if the other ETFs in the pipeline for the SEC are facing the same stone wall."" But will the decision slow bitcoin down itself? Adam Back, CEO of bitcoin startup Blockstream, said he thinks today's turn of events has only delayed the inevitable. He told CoinDesk: Others, too, reflect on the decision in light of the digital currency's future. Dave Nadig, CEO of industry news site ETF.com, said he wasn't surprised by the SEC's move. In fact, he posited that bitcoin's unregulated nature is an inherent part of the digital currency. ""The decision isn't that surprising. Ultimately this is less about what bitcoin is or isn't, and is about the underlying market structure for bitcoin itself. If the SEC doesn't know where the buck stops on a security, it's hard for them to get behind it,"" he said, concluding: Image via Shutterstock

The SEC has been weighing a proposed rule change that would pave the way for the ETF to be listed on the Bats BZX Exchange. In that time, the SEC has solicited numerous public comments and punted its decision forward several times. As well, the ETF’s backers have expanded the scope of the offering from an initial $20m to $100m.

While the SEC declined to comment on when it would publish its decision, those who have seen similar announcements from the agency say it could come as early as 4pm ET or as late as 6pm ET – essentially, once US stock markets close their doors. Jeff Bishop, ETF expert and co-founder of investor message board platform RagingBull.com, told CoinDesk: Others echoed of this view, including Eric Balchunas, a senior ETF analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence, who affirmed that he has heard chatter that the SEC will announce its decision between 5pm ET and 6pm ET. Phil Bak, a former New York Stock Exchange managing director and current CEO of ETF issuer ACSI Funds, said he thinks the SEC will wait until US markets close to reveal its decision. ""Usually they come in during the morning, but in this case we can probably expect it after the close … I would expect it between 4:00 and 6:00 or so,"" he said in an email. Image via Shutterstock

The agency is hosting an event today focused on improving awareness among retail investors about market risks. As part of it, the SEC has opened an email line for people to submit questions. Perhaps unsurprisingly, those hungry for information about the bitcoin ETF proposed by Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss have been sending in queries to that email line. The SEC is currently weighing a proposed rule change that would clear the ETF to be listed on the Bats BZX exchange. While it’s not immediately clear how many requests the SEC has received, an agency staffer commented on the queries while highlighting the Q&A line, telling the audience: The years-long process to get the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF approved is expected to come to a conclusion today, a move confirmed by an SEC representative when reached at press time. MarketWatch journalist Ryan Vlastelica reported earlier that an SEC representative had similarly confirmed the planned move.

The Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine, or FIBRE, was unveiled last summer as successor to the earlier Bitcoin Relay Network. Previously described as a kind of ""nervous system"" for the network, the concept at its heart seeks to enable miners to gain access to block data more quickly, helping them avoid creating orphan blocks, for one. As shown on GitHub, FIBRE got some bug fixes along with its first release tied to Core's latest software version. But according to Core contributor Matt Corallo, it was work connected to compact blocks – as well as development related to how efficiently nodes on the network can transmit data – that resulted in a boost to FIBRE’s ability to move block information worldwide. Corallo explained: Corallo went on to say that he has “noticed a remarkable improvement here” since the shift to 0.14.0 began.

Bitso, which raised $2.5m in new funding last September, said it has been working with Paycase to send funds from bank accounts in Canada to others in Mexico. In one instance, the firms said today, a fiat currency micropayment was sent from a Canadian bank to Paycase before it was transmitted to Bitso using bitcoin, before finally settling as fiat in a Mexican bank account. According to the startups, the entire process took roughly three minutes to complete. Pablo Gonzalez, Bitso’s chief executive, said: While they did not provide an indication of when the service might go live, the two companies framed the work in the context of economic turbulence in North America. Paycase CEO Joseph Weinberg said: ""We believe this corridor becomes ever more critical to the stability of the North American market"". Remittances are an application of bitcoin technology that has seen broad interest since the digital currency's launch, with its borderless nature and underlying software driving the exploration of ways to more conveniently send funds from one country or region to another. Bitso and Paycase are said to have been exploring this area for the past year. However, factors such as the cost of compliance and resistance toward the digital currency on the part of banking institutions has, in some instances, stymied momentum for bitcoin-based remittance services. At the same time, some firms in the space have advanced their platforms amidst a difficult regulatory environment.

                            How Bitcoin's P2P Layer Got a Speed Hike in the Latest Core Release                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/how-bitcoins-p2p-layer-got-a-speed-hike-in-the-latest-core-release/," “Satoshi left us with a monolithic blob of a codebase.” That was bitcoin developer Cory Fields’ way of saying that, despite the innovation it’s often credited with, Bitcoin Core's code is kind of a mess behind the scenes. It’s a problem Fields and others have been grappling with since at least 2015, when he presented his plans to move around one piece of the code: the peer-to-peer layer. The problem developers often encounter is that the components are not all neatly separated. So, if developers change something that’s only supposed to impact one portion of bitcoin and how it functions, Fields said, it could unintentionally impact another, say, validation, mempool, the wallet, or p2p. For one, this makes it more difficult for newer bitcoin contributors to learn the ropes. So, in projects such as Fields' and libconsensus (an ongoing project to allow alternative implementations to remain in consensus with the bitcoin network), the goal is to separate the code into more distinct chunks in an attempt to make it easier, and less necessary, for developers to understand how the pieces fit together. Fields, whose work is funded by MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, has been working on breaking out the peer-to-peer codebase in particular. Much of his work is making a first appearance in Bitcoin Core’s latest software release. Fields told CoinDesk: He mentioned, however, that over time many developers, such as Jonas Schnelli and Matt Corallo, have contributed to the layer, and importantly many more have had a hand in reviewing and testing the changes. The peer-to-peer layer deals with the connections between the thousands of bitcoin nodes on the network (maybe more than 50,000, though, exact counts are difficult to come by), which are constantly 'talking' to each other, passing information as users send bitcoins, or miners create new blocks. One tricky part is that the bitcoin network is valued at roughly $19bn, meaning changes to the underlying code have to be undertaken extremely carefully. For that and other reasons, refactoring hasn’t been an easy process. Not even for Fields, who is one of the more active contributors to Bitcoin Core. (""I spend nearly all of my waking hours on bitcoin,"" he said.) First, he tried to a separate layer from scratch. That effort ""failed miserably"". His later approach of working to improve the existing codebase arguably worked better than expected though, leading to a “Satoshi-era” bug discovery. “As I started to break things up, I noticed something odd about Core's bandwidth usage during initial block download,” Fields said. The problem was that, when a node would download blocks from another node, the speed at which blocks were passed along would be sometimes fast, other times slow – and at unexpected levels. Digging further, he and other developers determined that nodes would stubbornly refuse to send data and process data at the same time (though this is an oversimplification). The node would just do one process at a time. The fix the team finally arrived at saw its debut in the recent Bitcoin Core code release, changing how quickly nodes can pass information to one another. “In particular, the p2p layer gets a huge speedup,” Fields said. He ran some tests to compare the last bitcoin version (0.13.2) with the new version with the improvements (0.14.0), looking at nodes that were deployed to the cloud on Amazon EC2 instances with two CPUs and 4GB of RAM. The tests showed a doubling in speed – at least, when comparing the performance of sending data between two v0.13.2 nodes, versus between two v0.14.0 nodes.  The caveat here is that it might result in a bit less than a two-times performance improvement on the real network, according to Fields. Now, the peer-to-peer layer is mostly separate from the rest. It's worth repeating that, the above performance improvements aside, most of the changes aren’t ones that users will notice, but are more of a boon for developers. That said, the hope is that they could have longer-term impact. ""I'm hoping that allows us to improve p2p at a faster pace now,"" Fields said. For example, it would have been more difficult to make the changes included in the latest version of Core if Fields had not already worked to isolate the code.

The Taiwan-based firm plans to use the money to create new implementations of the security in its wallet for use in Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, the medical industry and other blockchain sectors where identity is paramount. The founder and CEO of lead investor Kyber Capital positioned CoolBitX's Coolwallet technology as a more broadly applicable “decentralized security protocol”. In conversation with CoinDesk, Thomas Hu said: CoolBitX secures its wallets with an embedded security device for securing private keys, as well as a complete signature authorization and verification mechanism that can be synchronized with a smartphone and CoolWallet’s own backup facility. Offline pass phrases can also be used to recover lost or stolen hardware devices. As possible evidence of industry interest in non-cryptocurrency related applications of CoolBitX’s security tech, Taiwan-based medical devices firm iMediPlus also participated in the round. In a statement sent exclusively to CoinDesk, iMediPlus’s chief legal officer and intellectual property counsel, Matthew Lee, positioned the technology as a possible means to help prevent insurance fraud, among other broader applications in the healthcare industry. “We are working with CoolBitX to turn CoolWallet into a secure passport for personal healthcare information and medical data backup storage,” Lee said in the statement. Other investors include bitcoin mining firm Bitmain and Asia Pacific venture capital firm Midana Capital. This is the most recent blockchain investment by Kyber Capital, which now boasts a portfolio of eight blockchain companies including Taiwan-based Amis, which is a founding member of the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. With part of the new investment, CoolBitX plans to develop a secure communication system that encrypts files on a smartphone, as well as implementing a decentralized bitcoin exchange. But the investment is also part of a larger push in the blockchain industry by a number of companies looking to secure blockchain systems with hardware. Last month, consultancy giant Accenture partnered with security firm Thales to reveal a hardware security module designed to give enterprises more confidence in securing access to their blockchain solutions. IBM also produces a similar hardware security module. A business development plan for CoolBitX shown to CoinDesk reveals plans to issue co-branded wallets with 10 enterprise clients in Q2 of this year, followed by the development of a ""blockchain medical record"" using Coolwallet. ""CoolWallet in this system encrypts medical data with its private keys,"" said Hu, ""and uses its HD [hierarchical deterministic] wallet architecture to offer different levels of accessibility to different institutions and staff."" In conclusion, he said the expansion was actually part of an even broader play: Medical investment image via Shutterstock. Wallet image via CoolBitX

                            From First Filing to Final Decision: The Journey of the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF                        ",Garrett Keirns,https://www.coindesk.com/the-journey-of-the-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf/,"It’s a looming decision that has sparked global headlines, turned the heads of financial analysts and kept the bitcoin world on the edge of its proverbial seat. This refers, of course, to the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. That ETF – first proposed in mid-2013 and subject to a range of public comments and exchange switches – is effectively waiting in the wings for a decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission, which is weighing a rule change proposal that would clear its passage. While most in the digital currency space likely know the ins-and-outs of the ETF story, those not so familiar with it might not understand all the details. In this feature, CoinDesk explores the journey - from start to near-finish – of the proposed bitcoin ETF. Before getting into the story of the bitcoin ETF’s early days, it might help to understand who Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are exactly. Both graduates from Harvard University, the two took part in the 2008 Beijing Olympics in the men’s rowing competition, where they advanced to the finals and ultimately scored sixth place, according to ESPN. Another major event in their pre-bitcoin days was the now-infamous legal battle with Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, documented in the 2010 film The Social Network. While at Harvard, the Winklevosses conceived a social network, ultimately dubbed ConnectU, for which they began working with Zuckerberg. Yet Zuckerberg soon opened the well-known Facebook platform, sparking the legal fight that resulted in a $65m settlement. Yet it was their bet on bitcoin – which they revealed in early 2013 – that set them on the course toward this week’s SEC decision. Amassing a considerable amount of coins, the two perhaps represented an early voice of confidence in the digital currency among mainstream investors. Several months later, their first S-1 was filed with the SEC, formally registering their intention to launch an ETF tied to bitcoin. It was in that initial filing that the fundamental argument for the ETF’s existence was first put forward. Simply put, the product was pitched as a way for more seasoned investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without having to purchase and hold the digital currency. As explained in the filing: Then, like many other things in the bitcoin space, the collapse of Japan-based bitcoin exchange Mt Gox triggered a small but meaningful change in how the ETF would be constructed. Mt Gox was once the world’s most voluminous bitcoin exchange before it fell apart amid accusations of fraud, leading to the eventual arrest of its CEO last year. In the aftermath of the Gox failure, an amendment was filed to the ETF’s S-1 which changed the price index which the ETF would use to determine the price of a bitcoin. The proprietary Winkdex was adopted, replacing the old model based on weighted average prices of several bitcoin exchanges. The duo confirmed, in a follow-up filing in 2014, their initial intention to list the ETF on the NASDAQ OMX exchange. The ticker symbol “COIN” – a tip of the hat to the digital currency – was first disclosed at this time. That filing also added new risk factors related to the ETF, including the potential for a so-called 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network. That submission would prove to be yet another leg in a long waiting game for the Winklevoss-backed ETF. During that time, the Winklevosses were approved for a bank charter, setting the stage for the launch of Gemini, their digital currency exchange. Last year, in a summer defined by the Bitfinex exchange hack and the collapse of the DAO, the ethereum-based project funding vehicle, the calculus for the Winklevoss ETF shifted significantly. A new filing in June revealed a plan to debut the product on the Bats BZX Exchange. The scope of the offering also expanded, from an initial $20m to $65m. That request led to further delays last fall, triggering a call from the SEC in October for more public comment, seeking more input from both stakeholders and critics of the idea. The SEC went to further delay the decision process in January of this year, setting the stage for this week’s deadline. Since then, however, the scope of the proposed ETF offering has expanded further, growing from $65m to $100m, while also lowering the maximum offering per share price from from $65 to $10. A February filing detailing the changes also included language about the risks of a network hard fork and contingency plans should two blockchains sharing bitcoin’s transaction history emerge. Those developments take us to the present day, during which market observers, stakeholders, bitcoin enthusiasts and potential investors are watching the skies for the SEC’s word. That determination is set to be revealed by tomorrow, according to a source with knowledge of the agency’s work, yet at press time, the SEC has kept mum about its decision. In the meantime, bitcoin traders are gearing up for a possible increase in volume – and volatility – when markets react one way or another, and at least one hedge fund that invests in bitcoin has moved to reduce its exposure to the market. But until the decision is made, all eyes are on the SEC. Image via Shutterstock

The bill, HB 436, was passed in the New Hampshire House of Representatives yesterday by a vote of 185-170. With the passage, the measure now moves to the state Senate for further consideration. Public records currently do not indicate when the New Hampshire Senate will take up the bill. Specifically, HB 436 seeks to exempt virtual currency users from having to register as money service businesses, while also creating a formal definition for ""virtual currency"" under state law. According to a draft text of the bill, the exemption applies to ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"". The bill was sponsored by Rep. Barbara Biggie, a former Western Union employee, and co-sponsored Rep. Keith Ammon, a bitcoin early adopter and libertarian activist in New Hampshire. The bill was first introduced in January, moving out of the House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee on 16th February. HB 436 stands in contrast with New York’s BitLicense, formalized in 2015, which added new compliance layers under the state's financial regulations for businesses dealing in digital currencies. The bill's advancement is the latest sign that state legislatures around the US are moving quickly on new laws related to the tech. Just this week, lawmakers in Maine put forward a proposal to create a commission that would study the veracity of blockchain-based elections. The goal, according to the measure filed, is to see whether the tech can improve transparency while also aiding the accuracy of paper-based votes. Image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Mining Pool Backs Rootstock Smart Contracts Effort                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/rootstocks-merge-mining-advances-bitcoin-smart-contracts-effort/,"As the community of blockchain developers around the world pushes ever deeper into smart contracts, bitcoin is being left behind. Even as the cryptocurrency on the bitcoin blockchain continues to hover around record highs, the diversity of applications being built on top of the distributed ledger of transactions plateaued years ago. But one company is helping lead the charge to give bitcoin developers the ability to write sophisticated self-executing lines of code on top of what is widely considered the most secure blockchain. Announced today, Argentina-based RSK (also known as Rootstock) has completed the first complete transition of a bitcoin exchange to a process called 'merge-mining' of its test network. Since last week, every single miner on the Bitcoin India mining pool as been earning what RSK calls 'smart bitcoins' along with their share of the pool's bitcoin rewards. Similar to how the ethereum network is fueled by the ether cryptocurrency, the smart bitcoins mined through RSK would power the startup's smart contract ecosystem. RSK’s new business development manager, Henry Sraigman says the transition of bitcoin miners to the RSK merge-mining is designed to give the resilient bitcoin ecosystem increased opportunity for creativity. Sraigman said: Bitcoin India began the process of switching over to RSK merge-mining last March, during the exploratory phase of the testnet. By November, its pool, which also mines litecoin and ethereum, had begun the merge-mining process on RSK’s testnet and the bitcoin mainnet concurrently. Instead of a full switch to merge-mining, Bitcoin India started with only 1 petahash of its total hashing power, and ""progressively increased"" to the 11 petashashes currently being deployed, according to the firm's co-founder, Yoshi Goto. ""After the startup phase,"" Goto told CoinDesk, ""the merge-mining process has been working with no downtime for the last months and we can expect the hashing power to keep rising."" Increasingly, the number of developers building on a blockchain is being portrayed as an asset to the wide variety of industries interested in building non-cryptocurrency applications on a blockchain. While the bitcoin developer community is widely regarded as one of the largest, the lack of sophisticated smart contract abilities has limited growth, according to Sraigman. So instead of mining a new coin to compete with the likes of ethereum, or launching a distributed ledger without a currency as have other competitors in the space, Sraigman says RSK wanted to build a tech solution that would allow give bitcoin developers more sophisticated tools. To that end, the firm last year raised a $1m seed round and gathered 25 bitcoin startups included Bitfinex, BitPay, Bitstamp, BTCC and Xapo to commit to helping develop bitcoin smart contracts via its sidechain solution. According to Sraigman, RSK is currently “on-boarding” mining pools around the world and teaching them how to integrate merge-mining. In spite of some concern that the RSK blockchain might compromise anonymity, Sraigman expects the company will have 50% of global bitcoin miners switched over to 100% merge-mining in the coming months. If the testnet switches over to a live network in May, as planned, merge-mining is expected to give miners on the bitcoin network access to a new source of revenue with no added mining power demands.

While BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin yesterday announced that they had completed technical upgrades requested by the People's Bank of China, local legal experts believe a decision is likely to be delayed until the end of the National People's Congress, which unites lawmakers through 15th March. Financial services consultant Zennon Kapron, an author who has written on China's relationship with bitcoin, for example, believes it's ""unlikely"" that any change in the regulator's current positions will be made before then. Bitcoin withdrawals at major exchanges have been suspended since 9th February, when Huobi and OKCoin revealed they would halt operations for one month in order to upgrade their AML systems. BTCC, while originally promising a speedy return to normal, eventually said it would delay services for one month, as well, and smaller exchanges later followed suit. In agreement with Kapron was Roland Sun, legal lead for blockchain consortium effort ChinaLedger, who said exchanges weren't likely to reopen ""this week or next"" due to the congress. Adding to the speculation is that China-based bitcoin exchange Yunbi, which was one of the rare services not to suspend withdrawals, announced yesterday that it would cease allowing bitcoin and litecoin transactions.

                            How Bitcoin Traders Are Preparing for the SEC's ETF Decision                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-preparing-sec-etf-decision/,"The world's bitcoin traders are getting ready for this week's decision by the US Securities and Exchange Commission on an exchange-traded fund (ETF) tied to the digital currency. The agency is expected to make its decision by Friday. Specifically, the SEC is considering a proposed rule change by the Bats Global Exchange that would clear the way for it to list the bitcoin ETF sought by investors Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss. In the meantime, traders are preparing for what's to come – a process that, according to some in the market, means gearing up for the expected volatility that might follow, regardless of the SEC's choice. Joe Lee, co-founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, told CoinDesk: Investor and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham argued that while there's little indication as to which direction the agency go, the potential for volatility is virtually guaranteed. ""Volatility is coming back after the decision is made,"" said Lingham. Lingham certainly wasn't alone in articulating this point of view. CryptoCompare founder Charles Hayter told CoinDesk that, from his perspective, overall volume should climb as well. ""We expect volatility to increase and volumes too across all markets,"" he said. Magnr's Lee similarly speculated that volumes could climb. He said that trading platform employees are doing what they can on their side to prepare for the decision's impact. Specifically, he said that staff will be on-hand to resolve any potential issues that may result in the expected increase in trade activity. ""It's mostly business as usual, but with more hands on deck to ensure all of our trades go through as expected,"" he said. ""We'll be monitoring the situation closely either way to ensure our clients get a smooth trading experience."" Many market analysts have asserted that traders have already priced in the ETF's chance of receiving approval, a development that has coincided with bitcoin's price repeatedly nearing $1,300 in recent sessions. After reaching these lofty levels, some have warned that prices could potentially suffer a pullback if the agency opts to reject this proposed fund. While many traders indicated that they have braced themselves for volatility, some revealed they have specific plans in case bitcoin prices plunge following the SEC's decision. At least one market trader has suggested that they are getting ready for the worst-case scenario: a ""no"" decision, followed by a sharp drop. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, told CoinDesk that his team is planning to react accordingly should the situation play out in that way. ""We're going to position ourselves to go short, perhaps massively so, if the market looks as if it's going to drop significantly based on a negative SEC decision,"" he explained. Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff took a somewhat different point of view, suggesting that he would look for opportunities amidst any possible price decline. ""I'm waiting to do some buying on any major dip – I don't think we've seen the last of $1,000,"" said Eliosoff. Image via Shutterstock

                            Could Smart Contract-Based Bribes Threaten Bitcoin Mining Pools?                        ",Garrett Keirns,https://www.coindesk.com/smart-contract-bribes-bitcoin-mining-pools/,"Could bribery payments issued via smart contract undo the bitcoin mining pool model? A new research paper outlines a kind of attack against pools in which a malicious actor uses smart contracts, or agreements hard-coded onto a blockchain, to pay miners to essentially stymie their own efforts to solve the cryptographic puzzles at the heart of mining. Mining is an energy-intensive – and competitive – process by which parties race to add the next block of transactions to the network. The paper, entitled ""Smart Contracts Make Bitcoin Mining Pools Vulnerable"", was penned by Yaron Velner of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem; Jason Teutsch of the University of Alabama and Birmingham; and Loi Luu of the National University of Singapore's School of Computing. Made available on 7th March, the research posits that, in the right scenario, someone could use smart contracts to guarantee payments to miners who, in that case, would then withhold information from the pools (or large conglomerations of miners) to which they are connected. By doing so, the malicious actor effectively increases their share of any profits relative to the pool's total hash rate. Conversely, this attack could be deployed to break up an opposing pool to the benefit of another. Yet the key is the use of a smart contract, the authors say, who go on to explain: Why take this route? Those who mine on their own without a significant amount of hashing power run the risk of burning all that electricity with no profits to show for it. So, miners congregate around pools, which concentrate that hashing power onto one point, splitting the block rewards received (if any) and distributing those bitcoins to the miners miner based upon the hash rate they contribute. With a block withholding attack, a miner who has a big amount of hashing power divides it between two pools, withholding full proof-of-work solutions from one of them. Yet according to the authors, it wasn’t until the development of smart contracts that this type of coordinated internal mining attack was possible. Still, the attack isn't guaranteed, as some miners – particularly those guided by ethical considerations and those who don't want to rely on a smart contract to get paid (given that those contracts have failed due to flaws in the past) – might not want to participate, according to the researchers.

Now rebranded as Veem, the company that aims to make bank wire transfers extinct, will first use the new funds to usher in two-way transactions in all of the countries it already does business with. Then, later this year, the company plans to spend additional resources leveraging an upcoming hiring spree to accelerate the rate it expands into additional markets. But perhaps the most dramatic change going forward could be the addition of a new blockchain as an additional payments rail on which Veem’s customers can transact. In conversation with CoinDesk, Veem’s co-founder and CEO Marwan Forzley said that, while his company’s main payments rail continues to be the bitcoin blockchain, they are also able to send payments using Swift’s interbank messaging platform, and given sufficient liquidity, are actively exploring additional blockchains. According to Forzley: The Series B investment was led by the recently launched National Australia Bank Ventures, with GV (formerly Google Ventures) and SBI Investment Co, also participating. All three investors already back payments platform Ripple. Existing investors Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers and Silicon Valley Bank also participated in the latest round, which follows a $12.5m Series A in 2015. Founded in 2014, the San Franisco-based Veem has grown to serve 60 countries worldwide. It's service works by holding pools of currencies in accounts around the world and converting payments in fiat currency to bitcoin – which can be sent around the world almost instantly – then converting them to another currency in the receiving country. But, of the countries it serves, only 35 are what Forzley calls “bi-directional,” meaning a transaction can be made in both directions between various national currencies. As a result, over the coming months the founder expects that the remaining 25 or so nations will be converted to a two-way exchange, with additional nations being added by the end of the year. The company is one of the most heavily funded startups using bitcoin to simplify global payments – an industry that is also being disrupted by Swift itself, with the interbank payments messaging service upgrading its own payment services just last month. Though Veem isn’t currently disclosing the countries it will add next, Forzley hinted that the national headquarters of the investing companies could be seen as an indication of future plans.  In addition to the new countries and possible new blockchains, Forzley says Veem is currently hiring engineers and others to create a series of features aimed at ""substantially"" changing the experience customers are used to at a bank. ""Bank wire is just not designed for the modern era and modern users,"" he said. ""So there’s an opportunity to team up here and build that for our user base."" Accompanying the cash infusion, Align Commerce decided to rebrand as Veem for multiple reasons. At the time the company was launched three years ago, the original name was chosen to reflect the mission of “aligning” the payment rails provided by the bitcoin blockchain with existing payments options such as Swift and traditional fiat currency. But as user growth has accelerated ""exponentially"" year over year, according to the CEO, the firm began the process of looking for a brand that not only reflected how customers use a product, but can be used as a verb. ""Just veem it,"" is a phrase Forzley said he’d like to see become commonplace among his users, the exact number of which he didn’t want to share. What does ""veem"" mean? Forzley defined the word in conversation with CoinDesk: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Veem. Funding image via Shutterstock.

The goal of the partnership is to increase capital inflows to new investment funds by providing an alternative funding method in the form of the digital currency. Fund promoters, working with CACEIS as a transfer agent, can start accepting bitcoin for fund subscriptions as soon as Q2 2017, the firms indicated. Bitstamp CEO, Nejc Kodrič, sees the partnership as a foothold for bitcoin to be used for mainstream, legitimate investment opportunities, “Bitstamp’s first partnership with a market-leading, asset-servicing bank like CACEIS means bitcoin investments can now be made within fully licensed and regulated framework,” he said. As bitcoin gains traction, it's easy to see why some investors are picking up interest. In jurisdictions with capital controls, using bitcoin circumnavigates regulatory headaches and streamlines cross-border payments. Joe Saliba, CACEIS deputy chief executive officer, said: Bitstamp has been on forefront of digital currency compliance in Europe. In July of last year, the exchange received the green light from regulators to act as the first fully authorized payment institution in Luxembourg. Bitcoin investment image via Shutterstock

                            Why Bitcoin Remittance Companies Are Still Shrugging Off Swift                        ",Frederick Reese,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-remittance-companies-strug-off-swift-blockchain/,"It could be said that Swift is under attack. In a changing global payments community, Swift – one of the world’s largest financial transaction messaging mediums – has faced new criticisms from those who say it has failed to keep up with the needs of the global financial market. Specifically, some believe Swift is proving to be inefficient in the settlement of cross-border payments, due to its inability to manage real-time settlement for any transaction amount and its lack of transparency in settlement risk and payment status. To address this, Swift has introduced its Global Payments Innovation (GPI) Initiative, which – according to Swift – will allow for same-day availability of funds for business-to-business transfers within the same time zone, payment tracking end-to-end, protected remittance information and improved transparency of fees. The first phase, which went live in January 2017 and is in use with 12 banks – including the Bank of China, Citi, Danske Bank and ING – will focus exclusively on business-to-business payments. Swift has also promised further enhancements to its cross-border payments system, possibly including the incorporation of a distributed ledger technology proof of concept, in future rollouts. This move to reform its global messaging service, however, may be too little, too late, in its attempt to catch up toward resolving the global payment clearance, settlement and payment bottleneck, particularly for non-bank customers. One demographic already working on these issues is the current and former bitcoin remitters, startups that are today using various blockchains to move money internationally. One such firm, Align Commerce, has made an impression in the fintech world due to its $20.25m in funding. The firm's CEO, Marwan Forzley, said he sees blockchain and distributed ledgers as a ""next generation"" opportunity – a car compared to the old banking horse and buggies. Forzley told CoinDesk: Cross-border payments have traditionally been the weak link in the global finance chain. Totalling $26tn in 2014, global payments are equivalent to more than one-third of the global gross domestic product. However, without any consistency or standardization among local infrastructures, most of these funds are locked in the modern-day equivalent of a message-by-bottle system. To send a payment cross-border, a customer must find and hire a transmitter to handle the transfer, which would have contacts with financial institutions in both the transmitting and recipient countries. Further complicating the process, these banks may have their own intermediaries. Each of the institutions handling the transfer charges its own fees for the service. The entire process can take up to a week. While the corporate section of the global market – estimated at $15.7tn in 2014 – can negotiate costs to 1% to 2% of the total amount of the payment, small and middle-sized businesses and person-to-person transactions could see a surcharge of up to 15%. This series of 'hidden fees' can affect those least capable to deal with it the hardest. Should a customer hail from an underserved or underbanked community, he or she may not have access to avenues that would otherwise allow for simplified cross-border payments, such as using a transnational bank to transfer the payment using their infrastructure. This leaves consumers and small businesses prone to international money transmitters, such as Western Union and SwiftPay, whose transaction fees can be both exorbitant and unpredictable. The emergence of bitcoin remittance companies – which allows consumers to make borderless transactions at a low, controlled cost – has helped to mitigate this issue on a small scale. While Swift has promised to help make cross-border payments more transparent with the GPI, it offers no relief regarding cost for customers that have no access to fee negotiation. ""The vast majority of the world's remittances are not done via banks, but by cash money transfer shops,"" George Harrap, CEO of Bitspark, told CoinDesk. ""This will not affect how they manage their business or transactions."" Hong Kong-based Bitspark is one of the largest bitcoin remittance services serving Southeast Asia, and despite the lack of traction, it still feels it has the best long-term hand, if for a separate market. ""Cost will remain the same as remittance companies batch payments anyway, so – potentially – reductions in wire fees do not affect companies who transfer $10m per transfer and draw down on this balance for small remits,"" he said, adding: Because of this division, as it is today, the Swift GPI is unlikely to influence bitcoin remittances in a significant way. Alan Safahi, the CEO of ZipZap, which raised $1.1m in 2014 to fund the expansion of the company’s cash-to-bitcoin service, agrees. ""ZipZap uses a combination of traditional (Swift) bank payment rails and blockchain technologies to find the least expensive and most efficient transfer option. The Swift GPI is primarily for B2B payments, so it will not impact ZipZap's current business flow,"" he said. This, however, may change once phase three of the GPI launches. While Swift intends the product to improve global payment transaction recording for its member institutions, it's feasible that GPI-inspired innovations may show up in other blockchain-enabled fintech applications. For example, Swift is a member of the HyperLedger Project, whose Fabric project may form the underpinning for future cross-border frameworks. However, as Swift GPI does not offer real-time processing, but offers real-time reconciliation of its 'nostro' account balances, GPI doesn’t address the needed changes to cross-border payments – particularly, for non-bank customers. As Ripple stated on its Insight blog, GPI is more of an attempt of a financial giant to stay relevant than a true effort toward modernization. The company states: Happy eggs image via Shutterstock

                            Chinese Exchanges to Resume Bitcoin Withdrawals Pending Regulator Approval                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/huobi-will-resume-bitcoin-withdrawals-pending-regulatory-approval/," UPDATE (8th March 13:28 BST): BTCC, OKCoin and CHBTC have released statements announcing their plans to reinstate cryptocurrency withdrawals pending regulatory approval. One of China's 'Big 3' exchanges has announced its intent to begin allowing customers to withdraw bitcoin from accounts. In a statement sent to CoinDesk today, Huobi indicated that it has updated its exchange service to ensure it meets the standards advised by regulators earlier this year. Huobi, like its counterparts BTCC and OKCoin, have faced increased scrutiny in recent months over alleged regulatory issues. As such, Huobi cited its commitment to following all anti-money laundering and foreign exchange laws, both areas of concern highlighted by the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank. Huobi said it remains committed to making the industry ""healthy"", doubling down on a commitment to compliance and security. The statement reads: The Beijing-based exchange first stopped bitcoin and litecoin withdrawal services on 9th February on request from the central bank, a move that would go on to impact the price of bitcoin in the weeks that followed. The full statement can now be found online here. China flag via CoinDesk

In a Medium post today, the San Francisco-based startup debuted '21 Lists', a new function that enables 21 users to offer bitcoin as a way to incentivize VCs, CEOs and angel investors to answer email messages from unknown senders. In advertisements, the startup has sought to position the offering as ""better than LinkedIn"". ""Each list is a mini-directory organized by profession or skill,"" the post explained. It went on to detail six lists that group participants into categories including 'VCs', 'CEOs', 'angels', 'founders' and 'blockchain'. The update is the latest that finds 21 moving away from a former bitcoin mining hardware product play and toward software solutions it believes will spur consumer use of the digital currency. In statements to CoinDesk earlier this month, 21 CEO Balaji Srinivasan pushed back on claims that the new product marks a pivot, indicating that its main goal is to increase bitcoin adoption. He went on to compare the bitcoin network favorably to other forms of payment. ""[Bitcoin] allows instant receipt of funds without linking a bank account, it works across borders and it can scale up and down to very small and large payments alike,"" he said.

In an email sent today to its mailing list, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), a Jersey-based investment vehicle that buys and sells bitcoin on behalf of investors, said it believes the market is now signaling a potential approval too strongly for its taste. Ultimately, GABI said it believes ""it does not seem likely"" that investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss will receive approval for the vehicle, which they first filed in 2013. GABI wrote in an email today: GABI goes on to write that it projects a 25% chance of approval on the decision. Either way, sources tell CoinDesk a decision is likely to happen this week. ""If it turns out we are wrong, and the ETF does launch, we will certainly miss a spike and will extend this month's underperformance into next,"" the statement continues. However, even if the ETF does not launch, GABI is optimistic bitcoin's price will head higher – even with continued scrutiny on the market from China's central bank. ""We think the ‘bull’ case for bitcoin will be considerably strengthened, and as such, we would expect a very protracted rally in which we will quickly seek to participate,"" the email reads. Elsewhere, the firm discussed the results of trading decisions earlier in the year, highlighting how its performance has been affected by developments in China, and how it has shifted its strategy in response. Launched in 2014, GABI received regulatory approval for its offering from the Jersey Financial Services Commission (JFSC). Principles for the fund include Jean-Marie Mognetti, Daniel Masters and Russell Newton.

                            SEC Expected to Decide Bitcoin ETF's Fate By Friday                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/sec-decide-bitcoin-etf-fate-friday/," The US Securities and Exchange Commission's decision on the much-anticipated bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is expected by Friday, according to a source with knowledge of the agency’s deliberations. The SEC has an 11th March deadline to make a decision regarding the proposed rule change that would clear the way for the ETF, which would be the first of its kind. Yet because the 11th falls on a Saturday, that decision will come before that date – potentially before Friday, the source said. The decision, regardless of the outcome, will cap a more than three-year period since investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss first filed with the SEC in mid-2013. Should the fund receive approval, some analysts have speculated that bitcoin markets could rise as a result. That expected approval appears to be baked into some quarters of the market already, driving the price to new all-time highs in recent days. The digital currency's price continually neared $1,300 in recent sessions, reaching $1,293.47 on 3rd March, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. However, bitcoin prices kept falling back during their climb toward $1,300, eventually experiencing a sharp drop on 7th March, during which markets plunged below $1,200 for a brief period. On the other hand, analysts have argued that, should the SEC reject the rule change that would allow the Bats Global Exchange to list the ETF, bitcoin's price could be negatively affected. Phil Bak, who was previously a New York Stock Exchange managing director and currently serves as CEO for ETF issuer ACSI Funds, told CoinDesk that, generally, the SEC seeks to avoid the appearance of ""publicly rejecting an ETF"". He went on to argue that, if the agency didn't plan on approving one of these funds, it would likely ask for the filing to be pulled ahead of any final decision. Yet according to Bak, the lack of such a pullback so close to the deadline could be driven by other factors specific to the bitcoin ETF. Bak explained: In the absence of a definitive statement from the SEC, it's perhaps easy to see why a common refrain of uncertainty has emerged the week of the decision. As Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of exchange platform BitMEX, explained: Hayes' exchange is home to an ETF-tied prediction market, where traders can essentially bet on the outcome of the decision, and that has seen significant fluctuations over the past month. At times, traders have given the fund estimated chances of between 2% and 70%, depending on the day. At press time, the prediction market shows a roughly 50% estimated chance of approval. Charles Hayter, co-founder and CEO of CryptoCompare, offered similar sentiment, stating that the fund's odds of receiving approval are ""more than likely plucked out of the air on this one"". Those close to the industry aren't the only ones comparing the SEC decision to a coin flip. For example, Bloomberg Intelligence senior analyst Eric Balchunas recently argued that the ETF has about a 50-50 chance of receiving approval. For now, at least, those standing by for the SEC's decision can only watch and wait as the 11th March deadline grows nearer. Yet, as argued by one analyst, those hoping for a conclusion to the years-long process might not get an answer until after that date. Jeff Bishop, ETF expert and co-founder of investor message board platform RagingBull.com, speculated that, in the end, the SEC could punt its decision further past the 11th – particularly in light of recent price gains. ""I have the feeling they will find a way to delay this even more though. With bitcoin at all-time highs and the SEC having a terrible record for allowing new ETFs to come to market at absolute tops, they will likely push back on this until things cool a bit,"" he said. That said, Bishop said he believes the ETF should be approved. ""It should be up to investors to decide the true price of bitcoin. The more liquidity and options [there are] to trade it, the more transparent and accurate the pricing will be,"" Bishop told CoinDesk, concluding: Image Credit: Mark Van Scyoc / Shutterstock.com

                            MIT Expo Spotlights Bitcoin Tech Concerns                        ",Amy Castor,https://www.coindesk.com/save-the-nodes-mit-bitcoin-expo-spotlights-tech-challenges/,"""We don't have a set foundation to build on yet."" That's how Neha Narula, director of research at MIT's Digital Currency Initiative (DCI), characterized her institution's outlook on progress (or lack thereof) in the blockchain industry at the fourth annual MIT Bitcoin Expo this week. Hosted by the student-run MIT Bitcoin Club, the two-day event served to highlight both the scope of the ongoing work at the university, and the difficulties and challenges being faced by the global developer groups seeking to popularize the technology for wider use. Narula told the audience: Some of those changes were visible at the conference, where several discussions focused on the all-too-familiar themes of how to scale the bitcoin blockchain while keeping the protocol secure. So far, the question of how to increase bitcoin's throughput (right now digital currency only handles around seven transactions per second) has divided the community. Some want to scale bitcoin by increasing the block size limit, while others prefer to prioritize off-chain solutions. Then, there is the question of who gets to make those decisions anyway. Some argue consensus is best left to the protocol's nodes and transaction validators (miners). But here, too, the issue quickly becomes complex. While all miners are full nodes by default, developers are concerned too few people are maintaining full copies of the blockchain altruistically. To that end, David Vorick, co-founder of the decentralized cloud storage platform Sia, urged more people to spin up full nodes for the benefit of the network. Full nodes enforce the consensus rules, so the argument is that if not enough enthusiasts run this component of the network, important decision making will fall into the hands of miners, who may be incentivized differently. Vorick warned: Today, most of the nodes on the bitcoin network are lightweight, simplified, payment verification (SPV) nodes that rely on the records kept by other full nodes. But, the problem with running full nodes, developers argue, is they incur costs, such as 125GB of hard-drive space. Some developers feel that growing storage requirement is just one more thing causing node operators to drop out of the network. Consider that a year ago, there were 5,700 reachable bitcoin nodes. That number has now dropped to around 4,900, according to Bitnodes, a website that tracks the size of the bitcoin node network. Vorick wasn't the only one to focus on bitcoin's health in this area. As part of an effort to reduce the size of a full node, bitcoin core developer Peter Todd presented a proposal for TXO commitments. Todd feels bitcoin's UTXO (unspent transaction output) database is becoming too bloated, making it more difficult for bitcoin users to run a full node. Todd told CoinDesk: Elsewhere, Todd was vocal about wanting to keep the bitcoin block size at 1MB. He feels Bitcoin Unlimited (a proposal for raising the block size limit) would make node ownership too onerous, leading to further centralization and creating a security risk for the network. Other speakers at the event kept the focus away from controversial development ideas. Though one could argue, in doing so, they have simply prioritized one set of solutions for the scaling debate. Similar to other recent technical conferences, like Scaling Bitcoin Milan, the MIT event saw discussion of so-called top-level or 'layer 2' bitcoin solutions that many argue will require the much-debated Segregated Witness upgrade. Tadge Dryja, who recently joined the DCI as a researcher, presented a proposal for Lightning Network, which he co-created, in which he made the case for SegWit's benefits to projects like his own. Lightning, which uses off-chain payments for processing transactions, is viewed by many as one of the most promising options for scaling bitcoin without the increase in block size. Dryja indicated he is currently working on a Lightning wallet software. But unless the network adopts Segregated Witness, which solves the transaction malleability problem, he'll have a lot more work ahead, he said. He told the audience: Videos of day 1 and day 2 of the event are available on Youtube. Classroom image via Shutterstock; James D'Angelo image via Paul Goldstein

According to local news sources, Zhou Xuedong, director of the PBoC's Business Administration unit, advocated for the potential use of blacklists against exchanges that violate the central bank's directives. He also suggested that the PBoC should explore regulating exchanges at the national level and require bitcoin exchanges obtain some form of licensure. Xuedong reportedly noted: On the other hand, Xuedong reportedly suggested that the PBoC undertake an ""observation period"" while, at the same time, moving to define so-called ""bottom lines"" to which exchanges need to adhere. He also called for deeper research – something that would likely occur in tandem with the PBoC's experimentation with a central bank-issued digital currency. The comments come just over two months after it was revealed that officials had met with representatives from China’s bitcoin exchange ecosystem. Those meetings ultimately led to the end of no-fee trading in China and the end of margin trading at those markets. Xuedong’s reported advocacy for continued observation seems to confirm stated plans by the PBoC to keep a watchful eye, while at the same time requiring changes to existing AML practices in the industry. In February, statements from the PBoC indicated that the central bank would consider closing non-compliant exchanges. Image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Price Hits Resistance in Bid to Breach $1,300                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-runs-resistance-near-1300/," Bitcoin prices appear to be encountering some resistance near $1,300. Order books on digital currency exchange Bitfinex show a rise in the amount of sell orders closer to that level, according to figures provided by BFX DATA. As of roughly 22:15 UTC, that increase can be seen in sell orders starting slightly below $1,280. Bitfinex sell orders accounted for more than 90% of all orders in the hour leading up to this time. However, buy orders maintained a very slim majority in the 24 hours before 22:15 UTC, making up 51.3% of all orders placed during this time. The exchange constitutes roughly 14% of the total bitcoin exchange market share by trade volume over the past 24 hours, data from Bitcoinity shows. This apparent resistance comes after the digital currency’s price set a fresh all-time high for the first time since late 2013, found parity with gold and repeatedly rose to new record heights. Amid this trend, bitcoin prices have repeatedly neared $1,300 but have thus far failed to reach it. The digital currency’s price has surpassed $1,280 and even $1,290 on more than one occasion, climbing as high as $1,293.47 on 3rd March, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. At press time, the price of bitcoin is averaging $1,279.63. As for what's driving the digital currency’s price in recent days, many market observers have pointed to the bitcoin ETF proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss. Currently, the SEC has a deadline of 11th March to decide on whether to approve or reject the ETF, though the decision could come at any time before that date. While some analysts have given the proposed fund low odds of approval – and at least one prediction market rates it at roughly a 50-50 chance – signs indicate that the broader market is already pricing in a positive decision.

                            What You Need to Know About Bitcoin's Upcoming Code Release                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/need-to-know-bitcoin-upcoming-code-release/,"Bitcoin's best-known proposed code change isn't the only one that matters. While the last few bitcoin code versions saw the gradual release of SegWit (a proposal that would alter transactions to boost scalability), developers are quietly improving bitcoin in other ways. The upcoming release – version 0.14.0 – is composed of performance boosts and long-in-the-making code shuffles that could pave the way for future upgrades. The version will be made available once a trial version successfully withstands testing by developers. As explained by Chaincode engineer Russell Yanofsky: You could argue that running a full node is the best way to take advantage of bitcoin's unique ability to minimize trust in third parties. Using the wallet features baked into the node is the most 'pure' way to send and receive payments, as well as to ensure better security and privacy of transactions. At least, that's compared to more popular, mobile-based SPV wallets, which store a smaller slice of block information and, as a result, require more trust in the network's miners. However, running a node continues to be a pain point for users, since it requires downloading every transaction sent since bitcoin emerged nearly 10 years ago. Perhaps the biggest performance improvement in 0.14.0 is that nodes can initially sync up with the network more quickly. Although the overall storage size is the same, in a trial run, 0.14.0 synched 5.7x faster than 0.13.2, the previous version, according to developers. This is accomplished with 'assumed valid blocks', which separate two processes: verifying historical signatures and checkpoints, where old block hashes are hardcoded into the software to prevent denial-of-service attacks. Further, while users have had the option of 'pruning' the blockchain for a while now, 0.14.0 introduces a 'manual pruning' option, where users can use a command-line option to cut out block information and, as a result, retain a smaller version of the blockchain. After that, there’s bumpfee, for which Yanofsky recently ""inherited"" the role of lead developer, and has been helping to test and complete. The idea is that bitcoin transactions are sometimes slow to be added to the blockchain, as there's limited room in each bitcoin block. And, since miners have some choice over which valid transactions are packaged into each block, they're more likely to include transactions with a higher fee. With a ""conservative"" fee, Yanofsky explained, you're not sure when your transaction will be included in a block. However, you can speed it up by using bumpfee to replace the old transaction with a new one that has a higher fee attached to it. ""Previously you would be kind of stuck because you don’t want to send a new payment. If they both go through then you’d pay twice,"" he told CoinDesk. The functionality is turned off by default, but users can activate it by using the command line, and is a feature that might be particularly useful as blocks are filling up. (This has long been a topic of bitcoin’s scaling debate, which we won’t get into here). Bumpfee uses opt-in replace-by-fee (RBF) under the hood, a feature that was introduced earlier that allows users to swap unconfirmed transactions with those with a higher fee. Developer James Hilliard spoke to the benefits of the underlying technology more generally – some of them longer-term. ""It's something important for things like [the] Lightning network as well, which need reliable transaction confirmations,"" he said. Though bumpfee uses a version wherein users can opt-in to replaceable transactions, it's worth noting that a full version, where every bitcoin transactions uses the feature, was controversial in the past. There are many other changes, some of which aim to optimize the mining process. One change improves block processing speeds by reducing the redundancy of verifying signatures in blocks, while the enhanced ""high-bandwidth mode"" can speed up block propagation across the network in some cases. ""Version 0.14 has plenty of optimizations such as networking-side stuff,"" Hilliard added. Further, Bitcoin developer Cory Fields’ peer-to-peer refactoring finally made it into the 0.14.0 release, after nearly two years of work. The hope is that it will clear the way for future upgrades and help new developers make sense of the codebase faster. Though, like many of the other miscellaneous changes included in the release, it’s not something that average users are likely to notice — at least not yet. Image via Shutterstock

                            Why You Won't See Bitcoin in a Casino Anytime Soon                        ",Aaron Stanley,https://www.coindesk.com/why-you-wont-be-using-bitcoin-in-a-us-casino-anytime-soon/,"As evidenced by a Google search for 'bitcoin casino', bitcoins and gambling go together like two pedals on the same bike. Bitcoin’s appeal as a cheap, efficient and low-key means of transmitting money has made it a hit among both online bettors and operators seeking reduced fees, lower chargeback risk and a way around legacy payment systems. But as of now, these benefits mainly apply to online casinos operating in jurisdictions with little or no regulatory oversight. While there has been some movement in Curacao, the UK and Malta recently, the use of cryptocurrencies in a legal and strongly-regulated gambling environment like the US still remains largely at the conceptual stage. Because of heavy regulation and a desire among the gaming industry and its regulators to protect the industry's slowly improving public image, bitcoin appears to be years away from earning approval for use in either physical or online casinos in the US. ""We have looked at digital currencies and do not find them appropriate for use in casino gaming at this time,"" AG Burnett, chairman of the Nevada Gaming Control Board, told CoinDesk. As Nevada is by far the country's largest gambling market, its regulators have an outsize influence on policymaking nationwide. Burnett continued: Asked why he maintains this position, Burnett stressed that the US dollar remains the backbone of Nevada's regulatory apparatus, and that any rethink of that must meet a high standard of merit. ""Our regulations and statutes are all based on monetary units that are standard, such as the US dollar,"" he said. ""In fact, I think most of our regulatory foundation, from audit to enforcement and accounting standards, are all based upon normal US currency being used in a gaming operation."" Burnett added that too much ambiguity surrounds bitcoin and its contemporaries, while questions of consumer demand still remain. ""There are multiple types of digital currencies, whereas there is only one US dollar,"" he said. But none of this is to say that there isn’t enormous opportunity for the use of bitcoin in a legal and regulated gaming context. ""It's a billion-dollar question,"" said Stu Hoegner, a cryptocurrency attorney with Gaming Counsel in Toronto. ""The potential is huge."" For the land-based industry, bitcoin offers a potential remedy to casinos that are simultaneously seeking new ways of appealing to more tech-savvy young players, while reducing the amount of cash that shuffles around gaming floors. Much like other industries, gaming is bending head-over-foot to attract millennial patrons to replenish its customer base. But younger players who grew up in the world of Xboxes and iPhones have a much higher threshold for being thrilled than do players in their 50s and 60s, many of whom are perfectly fine in front of a slot machine. Slots remain the key revenue drivers for the industry, so figuring out how to replace or augment any declines is a critical task. To this end, Burnett explained that the NGCB allows its licensees to operate bitcoin kiosks on their properties as long as the funds are used for non-gaming purposes. At least two Las Vegas properties have embraced this opportunity. The D Las Vegas Casino and Hotel and the Golden Gate Casino and Hotel made a splash in early 2014 by announcing a move to accept bitcoin payments for hotel rooms, restaurants and other on-site vendors. While this can be construed to some extent as a marketing gimmick, it is worth noting that Las Vegas has significantly diversified away from slot machines and table games towards hospitality and entertainment more broadly. Non-gaming revenues now comprise roughly two-thirds of revenue generated at Las Vegas Strip properties, and this revenue stream is a core component to any property’s business model. The other major issue facing casinos that digital currencies could potentially remedy is that they are heavily dependent on cash compared to other industries. Some experts estimate as much as 95% of casino floor transactions are conducted in cash. This has become problematic in recent years as federal law enforcement agencies, led by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), have begun putting pressure on casinos – which offer banking-type services like lines of credit and are regulated under the Bank Secrecy Act – to tighten up their anti-money laundering efforts. This has spawned a mini-wave of innovation within the space with regards to how payments are accepted, with companies like Sightline, Vantiv and others jostling for pole position in the race to rescue casinos from an overdependence on cash. At the 2016 Global Gaming Expo, the industry’s premier trade show in Las Vegas, one of the prevailing themes of the breakout sessions and vendor exhibits was the amount of work that remains to be done in this realm. But the strict regulatory framework in which US casinos operate again comes into play. The industry claims that it is the most heavily-regulated industry in the world. While casinos sometimes wear this as a badge of honor, the practical implication is that they often need regulatory approval for even the smallest of changes – such as moving a slot machine 10 feet on the gaming floor in some jurisdictions – with the end result being a throttling effect on outside-the-box innovation. Sara Slane, senior vice president of public affairs at the American Gaming Association – the trade body that represents casinos – said that the industry is still probably five years behind where it would like to be with regards to non-cash payments. Putting it all together, industry observers are confident that the US won’t be doing much trailblazing at the intersection of bitcoin and gambling in the coming years. ""It could be another way they'll evolve with moving currency around,” said David G Schwartz, director of the Centre for Gaming Research at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. He added: Others reckon that regulators in the US will likely take a follow-the-leader approach of their own and look for other countries to set the bar before deciding to dive in themselves. ""The leadership of a place like the Isle of Man might be constructive. Maybe an outfit like Malta pushing it forward,"" he said, concluding: Casino image via Shutterstock

Among the highlights was an unscripted, onstage confrontation between investor Roger Ver and researcher-pundit Tone Vays that came to a head in a bet relating to the future of Segregated Witness – a bitcoin upgrade put forward by the Bitcoin Core developer community late last year. The change has since faced heavy resistance from critics, including Ver and former bitcoin lead maintainer Gavin Andresen. Ver's comments came during a roundtable consisting of Vays, the founder of Sweden's Pirate Party Rick Falkvinge, former Bitcoin Foundation executive director Bruce Fenton and entrepreneur Joby Weeks. Ver, while notably absent when the onstage conversation began, later grabbed a microphone to address the audience. Ver told the crowd: Elsewhere in the conversation, Vays took aim at Bitcoin Unlimited, an alternative bitcoin implementation that seeks to increase the size of the network's transaction blocks, and that is favored by Ver. ""I have said this, if Bitcoin Unlimited becomes the dominant fork of bitcoin then I will remove myself from the public eye,"" said Vays. ""I may not sell my bitcoin, but will remove myself as a public speaker."" Later, Fenton, a board member at the Bitcoin Foundation, contended that 95% node consensus – the threshold required for network adoption of SegWit – will be extremely difficult, if not impossible. ""If I promised to give everyone in this conference hall one free bitcoin if they meet me outside after this panel,"" he said. ""I’m certain that less than 95% of you would show up. Ninety-five percent in anything, even among like-minded people, is very difficult."" The statements come amid continued in-fighting in the bitcoin community over how best to increase the network's capacity, a debate that now dates as far back as 2015. Image via Roger Ver

Texas House Joint Resolution 89, sponsored by Representative Matt Schaefer, would alter Article I of the Texas state constitution to enshrine the right to use any ""mutually agreed upon medium of exchange"". The bill was introduced on 2nd March. What’s more, the amendment would impede any government effort to interfere with that use or ownership. As the resolution states: If passed by the legislature, the proposed amendment would then be included on the ballot for approval by Texas voters this November. The proposal is perhaps unsurprising, given the state’s libertarian bent and cultural leanings toward the tech. The bill doesn’t put digital currencies on the same level as legal tender, and state regulators don’t recognize bitcoin as such in light of guidelines published in mid-2014. Image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Lending Concept Debuted At Bank of Japan Event                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-startup-haw-reveals-bitcoin-lending-market-concept/,"HAW Technologies has developed a bitcoin-based lending market concept, recently presented at an event hosted by Japan’s central bank. On 28th February, the Bank of Japan published the presentation outlining the project, developed by HAW and The Tokyo Tanshi, a major inter-dealer broker based in Japan. The goal, the startup said, was to create a kind of loan market that does away with trusted third parties. According to HAW, the market utilizes the Open Assets Protocol – known more commonly as 'colored coins' – in order to signify commodified rights of redemption to a particular loan. As for the market’s structural make up, each participant is a bitcoin node, acting as lenders or creditors in the ecosystem. Go Takahashi, HAW International's director, told CoinDesk: HAW went on to argue that the concept shows how the bitcoin blockchain can be used to create a “borderless” loan market. Yet as currently it exists, the set-up relies on the use of intermediaries and off-chain communication, namely mediators who sit between the creditor and lender. The mediator creates an unsigned transaction that would exchange the aforementioned assets and funds. The other parties provide signatures for the transaction, after which the mediator then broadcasts that transaction to the bitcoin blockchain for confirmation. That said, HAW sees this changing in the long-term – particularly in light of the development of so-called 'layer 2' technologies around bitcoin such as Lightning, which is being built to enable the creation of bitcoin payment channels. ""There is an opinion that distributed ledger is not suitable for pre-trade in terms of processing performance,"" Takahashi said. ""However, it is based on the existence of intermediaries, we believe that the distributed ledger may be compatible in decentralized market. We would like to advance the research with the view of layer 2 technology as well."" Lending money image via Shutterstock

A perfect sign of this bullish sentiment is the recent increase in trading volume, a development that helps illustrate the strength of bitcoin's current, upward trend. Bitcoin's 24-hour trading volume surpassed $365m today, more than 150% higher than the session low of close to $140m attained 1st March and more than 200% above the figure of roughly $110m reached 27th February, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. Bitcoin's price has repeatedly set new record highs over the last several sessions, rising to a fresh record of $1,284.33 today, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The digital currency's price has been following this trend since 23rd February, when they broke through the previous record of $1,156.89 set in November 2013. At the time of report, bitcoin prices had retreated slightly, falling to $1,259.59, BPI figures show. Another strong indicator of the market's bullish nature is long-short data. Bitfinex's market for BTC/USD trading has been heavily long today, BFX Data reveals. When measured in terms of long and short exposure, this currency pair has fluctuated between roughly 66% and 75% long during the session, pointing to the optimism that traders have about bitcoin's future price gains.  These bullish indicators could point to a continued rally in which bitcoin keeps reaching new all-time highs, which contrasts starkly with the period of more than three years when bitcoin prices failed to set a new all-time high.

The decision follows speculation by the legislature's Business and Labor Committee, which was reported earlier this month to be critical of the bill, according to local news sources. First introduced in the state senate in January, the bill eventually passed in a unanimous 46-0 vote, eventually moving on to the House of Representatives on 13th January.

Bitcoin's price, by comparison, is at $1,238.11, having opened the day at $1,230.02, BPI data shows.

Markets have seen dizzying changes in recent weeks, breaking through a three-year-old high on 23rd February. Prices have largely continued to climb since. Driving the price is overall bullish sentiment in the market, as traders have seemingly taken a positive tack toward the prospects of the US SEC approving the first-ever bitcoin ETF. The SEC has a deadline of 11th March to make its decision. Overall, it's been more than three years since the last time gold and bitcoin hit parity, though it's worth noting that this was on Mt Gox, which was the only exchange that had a price to reach parity.

Reuters has today published a new investigative piece exploring the links between Wright and Calvin Ayre, a Canadian entrepreneur with ties to the online gambling industry. The news agency also details alleged plans by the pair to seek as many as 400 patents related to bitcoin and blockchain technology in what it calls a ""land grab for intellectual property"". In late 2015, reporters identified Wright as at least one of the people behind the Nakamoto moniker – a move followed months later by a broad media roll-out backed by interviews with the BBC, The Economist and GQ. Yet observers quickly cast doubt on Wright’s assertions, sparking him to promise the release of more proof. Just days later, Wright said that he would provide no such proof. The latest report appears to confirm past rumors that major news outlets are once again pursuing leads in the story. Wright, the report goes on to detail, is working out of the offices of a firm called The Workshop Technologies, based in the UK. He was reportedly seen there as early as September of last year, where, according to Reuters, he has been providing work leading to the development of bitcoin patent applications. Among the other details to emerge in the report, Wright allegedly planned to pitch the government of Antigua on making bitcoin its official currency. A document obtained by the news outlet suggests Wright planned to argue that bitcoin is “a new backbone and commercial foundation for the internet”. However, according to Reuters, no confirmable information exists that would suggest such a presentation took place. Notably, Antigua is where Ayre set up a multi-million dollar call center, with the entrepreneur citing bitcoin gambling as a major trend moving forward. As the news outlet notes, bitcoin’s early code included support for a built-in poker lobby, using the digital currency as a medium of exchange. Image via the BBC

The market was an average of 90% long during the seven days through 1st March, according to information provided by cryptocurrency platform Whaleclub. In addition, this measure of sentiment averaged 94% during the 28th February session. This bullishness is driven in part by expectations surrounding the US Securities and Exchange Commission's looming decision on the first-ever bitcoin ETF. The SEC has an 11th March deadline to make its decision, one that has been delayed in the past. Image via Shutterstock

                            $1,210: Bitcoin Price Hits New All-Time High Amid Sustained Support                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/1210-bitcoin-price-hits-new-time-high/," Bitcoin is showing no sign of dropping below its all-time highs. After trading above $1,000 for more than two weeks, the bitcoin price has now provided what analysts believe is ample evidence the digital currency's price has established a floor at this level. The cryptocurrency has been enjoying its longest stretch above $1,000 in history, a period it began on 14th February. During this period, bitcoin prices have been pushing steadily higher, reaching a new all-time high of $1,186.33 on 23rd February and then rising to new record levels over the following sessions, according to the USD CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The digital currency most recently hit a fresh all-time high today, when it reached $1,210.16 at 03:00 UTC, BPI figures show. At the time of report, bitcoin prices had pulled back slightly from this level, trading at $1,196.38. Many market observers have emphasized that bitcoin prices could soon enjoy significant upside if the SEC approves the proposed Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, an investment fund which has an approval deadline on 11th March. Traders have already incorporated this event into bitcoin prices, according to several analysts. However, many market observers have projected that the proposed fund has low odds of receiving authorization from the government agency. Investor and serial entrepreneur Vinny Lingham, for example, gave the fund 10-15% odds of being approved in a recent blog post, while Spencer Bogart, former analyst with investment bank Needham & Co LLC, has indicated the ETF's odds of approval are less than 25%. While acceptance could fuel sharp price gains, a rejection could push bitcoin prices lower, analysts say. Still, amid this uncertain situation, bitcoin prices have been experiencing little volatility in the last few days, moving largely between $1,170 and $1,210 even as they have enjoyed a steady, upward climb.

The startup said that it received word last September from the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions that it would be required to hold cash reserves equal to any digital currency-denominated funds held for its customers. Citing the cost burden this requirement creates, Coinbase said that it would require its customers in Hawaii to close their accounts in the next 30 days and remove any funds they may be using the service to store. Further, Coinbase said that it would block new customer registrations from Hawaii, a policy decision it said would be ""indefinite"" in light of the regulatory concerns. However, Coinbase indicated that it could reopen its doors to customers in Hawaii should conditions improve, citing a push to create a blockchain working group in the state’s legislature as a positive development. The startup went on to say: It’s not the first time that Coinbase has closed up shop in a US state following regulatory concerns. In June 2015, Coinbase cited a similar move by the Wyoming Division of Banking to require commensurate cash reserves when it stopped serving customers in the state.

                            Banks Turn to Bitcoin Tracking in Fight Against Human Trafficking                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/big-banks-turn-to-bitcoin-tracking-in-fight-against-human-trafficking/,"A shift occurred in the summer of 2015 that sent modern-day slavers flocking to bitcoin. Following pressure from Illinois law enforcement, Visa and MasterCard ceased doing business with BackPage, an online classified ads service that has been accused of being a thinly veiled front for prostitution and human trafficking. As some positioned the move as the kind of ""moral policing"" for which bitcoin was a perfect workaround, the decision had an unintended side effect that may have actually helped make the job of modern day slave traders even easier. The tried-and-true investigative techniques that had been until that moment employed by law enforcement and banks to help prevent human trafficking were largely rendered null and void as the pedlars of human cargo embraced bitcoin. Then, in December 2015, a victim of human trafficking and sexual slavery, Timea Nagy, addressed a room filled with financial executives from some of the largest banks in Canada and made a plea for help. At the meeting, organised by the founder of social enterprise startup Timea's Cause as part of its process of training law enforcement and others to identify human trafficking victims, Nagy made a call to the room filled with financial executives, asking them to modernize the way they track the financial transactions that power human trafficking. Nagy told CoinDesk: The result of her plea was instant, and continues to bear fruit at some of the largest financial intuitions in Canada. The director of risk intelligence for the Bank of Montreal (BMO), Peter Warrack, stood to accept the challenge, and by the time he left the building, he'd been contacted by Canada regulator FINTRAC and many of his banking peers. ""She basically appealed to the audience, the banks, for help,"" Warrack told CoinDesk. ""Her message was: you're the banks, you see the money, you can help us identify the traffickers."" The response was swift. On 19th January, 2016, Warrack and his colleague at the Association of Certified Anti-money Laundering Specialists (ACAMS), Joseph Mari, formally launched Project Protect to reimagine the way human trafficking is tracked. Representatives from all five largest banks in Canada are participating in Project Protect, he said, including the Bank of Montreal, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the Royal Bank of Canada, Scotiabank and the Toronto-Dominion Bank. Another member of Project Protect, professional advisory firm Grant Thornton has published a detailed account of what to look for to identify human trafficking across industries, including suspicious trends in industries such as hospitality, automotive, property management, travel and the financial services. Initially, the group of banks, advisory firms and tech companies focused on drawing up a list of the high-tech ways slave traders cover their tracks, including 17 types of financial transaction patterns, six types of contextual 'indicators' and 11 types of financial transactions, formally published by FINTRAC in last December. The document has ""been sent out to every reporting institution in Canada"" resulting in a ""many hundreds of percent increase"" in the incidences of financial institutions reporting suspicious activity, according to Mari, who is also a senior manager of major investigations at BMO. Mari told CoinDesk: But over time, one payment method distinguished itself for being categorically different than the others. The official wording of the indicator on the official FINTRAC document describes what this particular type of human trafficking transaction might look like: ""Bitcoins or other virtual currencies: frequent purchases in multiples of small amounts (eg $3, $12, $24), directly by the client or through exchanges."" As part of the process of identifying human trafficking trends Project Protect has partnered with ""major technology companies"" which Mari didn't want to name for this report to ""scrape BackPage and other adult sites on a daily basis."" His team is looking for telephone numbers and emails to ""filter it down to what looks like human trafficking as opposed to normal sex trade workers."" But with a proliferation of guides posted by sex trade workers on how to use bitcoin on BackPage and elsewhere, the amount of data was increasing and proved particularly difficult to parse. ""As we started to flesh it out,"" Mari said. ""What we noticed was that cryptocurrency played a role in this, and it became a sub-stream within Project Protect."" On 7th February, Project Protect hosted an event dedicated exclusively to blockchain and cryptocurrencies at the Toronto chapter of ACAMS. Present was the senior research director of Canada’s central bank, James Chapman, Alan Cohn of the Blockchain Alliance, Joseph Weinberg of Paycase and Jonathan Levin of Chainalysis. Founded in 2015, Chainalysis's mission is to look for patterns on the bitcoin blockchain, in part to help fight cybercrime. Since signing a contract with Barclays following the startup's completion of the British bank’s Rise accelerator, Chainalysis has gone on to raise $1.6m and is now working in a formal capacity with Europol to help fight online criminals. At the Toronto event, Mari said he showed Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin the indicator criteria his team had determined based on crawling sites known to host human trafficking. ""He was able to pull up transactions that mirrored that,"" said Mari. Even if the identities were obscured, it was a potentially important step, he said. Levin confirmed with CoinDesk that he ""compared notes"" with event participants, going on to describe that since bitcoin is frequently exchanged for local currencies, identifying the ""typology"" of human trafficking using cryptocurrency required cooperation between companies like his, banks and the government. ""We can identify the difference between single sex workers and what looks more like human trafficking,"" Levin said, adding:  Since inspiring the creation of Project Protect, Timea Nagy has continued her work alongside law enforcement to shine a light on human trafficking. After an earlier non-profit she founded was unable to generate the funds it needed to be sustainable, Nagy launched Timea’s Cause as a for-profit social enterprise in 2014. She now works ""shoulder to shoulder"" with members of law enforcement to teach them how to identify human trafficking victims based on her own personal experience. Nagy told CoinDesk she first moved from her home in Hungary to Canada at the age of 19 in pursuit of a job as a nanny. After being told the nanny job was no longer available, she says she was ""broken in"" to the sex industry lifestyle and forced to perform various sexual acts earning her ""owners"" as much as $50k over the time she was kept. She said: Since that time, the industry has changed. Though she declined to share details of how frequently she’s seen bitcoin used by sex traffickers, she says she has witnessed the impact firsthand as a result of traveling across North America working with various law enforcement officials. Similar to Nagy’s own work, which has been conducted in tandem with both Canadian and US government officials, current anti-money laundering (AML) work to fight human trafficking using bitcoin is also international. Still, it is difficult to track the problem of human trafficking in Canada due to low incidences of reporting credited to the fear experienced by victims. But, between 2005 and 2012, there were 25 human trafficking convictions in the country, with the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimating a total of 20.9 million victims of human trafficking around the world. Globally, total profits generated from the industry are estimated by ILO to be $150bn. Helping track those profits is Joe Ciccolo, the second half of the so-called 'Bitcoin Joes' as they're known in the AML industry, along with Joseph Mari. On 9th March, Ciccolo’s BitAML is speaking at a sister-event to the Toronto gathering hosted by the Chicago chapter of ACAMS. Also scheduled to attend is the state’s Illinois Blockchain Initiative, first reported by CoinDesk, the president of Chicago-based Burling Bank, the CEO of bitcoin ATM company Digital Mint and more. Beyond that, a British think tank called the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) has commissioned Mari to review a paper analyzing the challenges of AML regulation around cryptocurrecies. The paper is expected to be be released in March as part of the European Union Parliament's plans to implement new regulations. It turns out Timea Nagy's plea for help has helped reveal just how much assistance is truly needed, even by the banks she herself reached out to. In spite of the international support, Mari emphasizes the efforts to use cryptocurrency to track human trafficking are still in their earliest phases. He describes Project Protect’s goal as two-fold. The first target is to increase the reporting of suspicious transactions that fit the criteria his team of banks and more has created. The second is more educational. But it’s not so much that they’re out to teach – which they are – but, rather, to learn, so they can better teach others how cryptocurrency is being used to continue modern-day slave trading.

                            What Bitcoin Traders Should Know About Technical Analysis                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-know-technical-analysis/,"While bitcoin traders have many tools they can use to evaluate the cryptocurrency market, one of the most tried-and-true methodologies is what's called technical analysis. Using this approach, traders can get a better sense of market sentiment and identify key trends, and, with this information, make better-informed predictions. Technicians (sometimes called 'chartists') take a practical approach, looking at a security’s history (using price charts) and applying various analytical tools to get a better sense of how the market feels about that particular security. While 'fundamental analysis' – the counterpart to technical analysis – is more interested in determining what a security 'should' be worth, technicians are only concerned with a security’s actual price movements. By looking at bitcoin’s price history, technicians attempt to identify well-known patterns such as 'support' and 'resistance'. To get a better understanding of technical analysis, it is important to grasp the basic concepts of Dow theory, which has provided the foundation for this practical method for evaluating securities. Dow Theory provides a few basic assumptions: 1. The market discounts everything. All past, current and even future information is already factored into existing asset prices. In the case of bitcoin, this would include variables such as past, current and future demand, as well as any regulations affecting the digital currency. The current price reflects all existing information, including the knowledge and expectations of all market participants. As a result, technicians seek to interpret what the price is saying about market sentiment to make educated predictions about what prices will do going forward. 2. Prices movements are not completely random. Instead, they frequently follow trends, which can be either short-term or long-term. Once a security forms a trend, it is more likely to follow that trend than go against it. Through technical analysis, technicians seek to identify trends and profit from them. 3. 'What' matters more than 'why'. Technicians focus more on a security's price history than the specific variables that have created this price movement. While any number of factors could have caused a security's price to move in a certain way, technicians take a more direct approach by looking at supply and demand. 4. History has a tendency to repeat itself. Market psychology is predictable, and traders often respond the same way when provided with similar stimuli. Digital currency markets, for example, have frequently provided bullish responses to key events such as news evidencing rising adoption or greater visibility. Identifying trends, or the general direction in which a security is moving, can be very helpful for bitcoin traders. However, singling these trends out can be a challenge. Digital currencies can be highly volatile, and looking at a chart of bitcoin's price movements will likely show a series of highs and lows. However, technicians know that they can look past the volatility and identify an uptrend when they see a sequence of higher highs and higher lows. In contrast, they can single out a downtrend when they identify a string of lower lows and lower highs. There are also sideways trends, in which a security experiences little in the way of upward or downward movement. Traders should know that trends come in many lengths, including short-term, intermediate, and long-term. One technique bitcoin traders can use to more easily identify trends is to use 'moving averages', which help smooth out a digital currency's price fluctuations so market participants can get a better sense of where the price has been going. The most basic kind of moving average is the 'simple moving average', which is determined by calculating a security’s average price over a specific time period. Traders might look at what bitcoin has done over a five-day or 20-day period, for example. A similar tool that bitcoin traders can use is the 'exponential moving average', which gives greater emphasis to more recent price values when calculating an average. By analyzing moving averages, traders can get a better sense of when momentum shifts. For example, if a five-day moving average falls below a 20-day moving average, this development could point to a bull market turning bearish. Should the opposite take place, with the shorter average rising above the longer average, the converse is true. Chart 1: A five-day moving average (SMA 5) repeatedly surpassing a 20-day moving average (SMA 20):  Another crucial tool is the analysis of support and resistance levels. By identifying these levels, bitcoin traders can help get a better sense of the supply and demand surrounding the digital currency. The support level is effectively the price at which a large number of traders are willing to buy a security, since they believe it is 'oversold' (ie sold at a price below its perceived true value). As the security approaches this price, market participants step in and purchase it, creating a 'floor'. For example, if bitcoin prices trade above $1,000 for several days, any retreat to this price level might prompt market participants to believe the currency is oversold and therefore start buying. Chart 2: Support level (in green):  The counterpart to support is resistance, which is a price level where a large number of traders are motivated to sell a security because they think it is 'overbought' (ie overvalued due to many traders buying at excessively high prices). For example, if bitcoin prices trade below $1,000 for several sessions, moving toward $1,000 might prompt a significant number of traders to enter sell orders for the security, thereby creating resistance. Chart 3: Resistance (in green):  Bitcoin sometimes fluctuates between levels of support and resistance, which work together to create a range. This is called 'rangebound trading', and creates opportunities for traders to buy bitcoin when it is near the bottom of the range and sell when it is close to the top. Chart 4: Ranges of support and resistance:  However, should bitcoin prices exit a trading range, this can result in robust trading activity, significant volatility and a new trend. For example, if bitcoin prices break through a price level that previously served as resistance, this price frequently ends up serving as a support level. Alternatively, the opposite could happen, with the digital currency’s price falling below support, resulting in this level becoming a new resistance level. Bitcoin traders should keep in mind that volume plays an important role in evaluating price trends. High volume points to strong price trends, while low volume indicates weaker trends. If bitcoin prices experience a large gain or loss, traders should be sure to examine volume. For example, if bitcoin enjoys a long uptrend and then declines sharply one day, it is worth checking out volume to get a better sense of whether this downward movement represents a new trend or simply a temporary pullback. Generally, rising prices coincide with increasing volume. If bitcoin prices enjoy an uptrend, but the currency’s upward movements take place amid weak volume, this could mean that the trend is running out of gas and could soon be over. Chart 5: Volume rising as the price climbs:  While technical analysis can be a valuable tool in a bitcoin trader's arsenal, those considering using it can benefit from being aware of the criticism brought against this particular approach. Much of this criticism comes from the 'efficient market' hypothesis, which is the idea that market prices reflect all available information. If this assertion is valid, then there is no value to be had from conducting analysis in an effort to determine when securities are undervalued or overvalued. Efficient market hypothesis has both its critics and advocates, and arguments can be made either for or against the idea. At the end of the day, it is up to each individual bitcoin trader to consider both sides and determine what they believe. By leveraging technical analysis, bitcoin traders can gauge market sentiment, identify trends and potentially make better-informed investment decisions. However, there are a few key variables they should keep in mind. For starters, technical analysis is a very practical approach, looking only at a security’s price and volume. As a result, relying on technical analysis could potentially cause a trader to either miss out on opportunities to buy bitcoin when it is undervalued or, alternatively, purchase the digital currency when the price may be inflated, at least according to the fundamentals. To manage this risk, bitcoin traders can potentially combine fundamental analysis with technical analysis. For example, if a bitcoin trader concludes that technical indicators and patterns are telling him to buy, he can help affirm this by evaluating some fundamental data, such as the approaching SEC ruling on the Winklevoss ETF. Alternatively, a bitcoin trader could leverage fundamental analysis to determine whether bitcoin is undervalued or overvalued and then harness technical analysis to calculate the best point to either buy or sell the digital currency.

                            Who Broke the SHA1 Algorithm (And What Does It Mean for Bitcoin)?                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/who-broke-the-sha1-algorithm-and-what-does-it-mean-for-bitcoin/,"The cryptography world has been buzzing with the news that researchers at Google and CWI Amsterdam have succeeded in successfully generating a 'hash collision' for two different documents using the SHA1 encryption algorithm, rendering the algorithm 'broken' according to cryptographic standards. But what does this mean in plain language, and what are the implications for the bitcoin network? As laid out in a recent CoinDesk explainer, a hash function (of which SHA1 is an example) is used to take a piece of data of any length, process it, and return another piece of data – the 'hash digest' – with a fixed length. One way that hash functions are used in computing is to check whether the contents of files are identical: as long as a hash function is secure, then two files which hash to the same value will always have the same contents. However, a hash collision occurs when two different files hash to the same value. Given the mathematical laws that govern hash functions, it is inevitable that hash collisions will occur for some values of input data (because the range of data you could put into the hash function is potentially infinite, but the output length is fixed). For a secure hash function, the probability of this should be so small that, in practice, it is not possible to make a sufficient number of calculations to find it. The significance of the Google/CWI team's results is in the fact that they were able to create a hash collision by finding a much more efficient method – 100,000 times more efficient in fact – than simply guessing every possible value of data. It's the efficiency of this method that means SHA1 is now officially broken. (These results are outlined in more depth on SHAttered.io, with an explanation of systems affected.) On 23rd February, a sharp-eyed Redditor on the /r/bitcoin page made a post pointing out that a long-standing bounty for discovering just such a SHA1 collision has now been claimed. The bounty – aimed to discover vulnerabilities in the algorithm – was originally announced by cryptography researcher Peter Todd in a post on the Bitcoin Talk forum in September 2013, but remained unclaimed until this week. The challenge consisted of a script, written by Todd, which would allow anyone to move the bitcoins from the bounty address to an address of their choice if they could submit two messages which were not equal in value, but resulted in the same digest when hashed. In addition to Todd, other contributors also donated to the bounty fund, raising a total of 2.5 bitcoins. According to the researcher, the timing of the claim – slightly after publication of the collision attack – suggests that it was a third party who had read the Google team's research and made use of the results, rather than one of the original researchers, that took the reward. Todd said: It's important to stress that the cryptography underpinning the bitcoin network, which makes use of the more secure SHA256 algorithm, is not directly affected by the discovery. But, besides enriching the mystery bounty recipient, the SHA1 collision vulnerability does pose a concern for the bitcoin development community, since its Git version control system uses SHA1 to generate the hash digest for commits. ""The consequences aren't that we have to stop using Git immediately,"" Todd said, ""but it will make it more important to review other people's work, because a third party could try to push a malicious commit in."" The vulnerability here is that an attacker could theoretically create two different versions of a code commit that would appear to be the same when hash values were compared – though for now, given the vast number of computations still needed to find a collision, it's highly unlikely that could happen. As well as SHA1, Todd has placed similar bounties on the RIPE MD160 and SHA256 hash functions – both of which are necessary for the integrity of the bitcoin standard, and would therefore be calamitous for the network if compromised.

                            After New Highs, Bitcoin Price Faces Uncertain Path Ahead                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/new-highs-bitcoin-price-faces-uncertain-path-ahead/," Where to, bitcoin? Just a day after reaching its highest value since its inception, there were many familiar markings of new bitcoin price activity. The milestone set off the typical slew of mainstream media articles, though it seems that every outlet offered a different take on the factors driving market activity. Quartz stuck closest to the prevailing sentiment, crediting the pending decision on the Winklevoss ETF, while TechCrunch cited strong stock markets and Bloomberg pointed to the Donald Trump presidency. Still, all combined, the reports perhaps show the lack of narrative at play in the currency market. This may be accurate, as it's still unclear to many how the price is likely to move going forward. So far, the price of bitcoin has encountered notable volatility since setting a new high, suffering a sharp drop in which its price again tested $1,100. At press time, the price of bitcoin was $1,157.47, $10 below its previous all-time high set in 2013, and suggesting market reticence at testing figures above this mark. That's not to say there's no direction. As reported by CoinDesk, there is a strong sentiment that the uptick in activity is the market 'pricing in' the SEC's upcoming decision on whether to approve the Winklevoss bitcoin ETF filing. The rationale goes something like this: should the SEC approve the investment vehicle, bitcoin could rise even further. Should it be denied, it's another case of 'buy the hype, sell the news'. Yet, there are other X-factors at play, not the least of which is China. In interview, China's traders were less certain about bitcoin's stability, suggesting that they believe that more actions could still be forthcoming. (China's central bank has so far spent much of 2017 issuing new edicts to exchanges, who have rushed to enact policy updates). Kong Gao, marketing manager of OTC trading firm Richfund, conceded that ""nobody knows"" what will happen next with the People's Bank of China, and suggested that fears are high that more actions could be forthcoming. ""It is generally thought that the recent PBoC's actions toward exchanges are attempts to lower the bitcoin price,"" he told CoinDesk. Others said that any delay in the restoration of bitcoin withdrawals at major exchanges – set for around 10th March as well – could impact price. At the same time, the price increase is also coloring bitcoin's long-simmering technical narrative – that it needs to scale in order to appeal to more users. As noted by investment firms, bitcoin hasn't yet emerged as a safe haven asset like gold, in part because of its unique (and volatile) relationship to its technical community. In this light, any correlation between bitcoin's price and technical challenges could emerge as a strong trend in 2017. Already, this week's price rise is quickly becoming politicized by those on both sides of the scaling debate. The prevailing argument – one over whether price is a success metric held by the whole community, or if other factors like user growth are more important – is likely to now intensify. All the while, the digital currency is enjoying a stretch above $1,000 that recently became the longest in history. How long this lasts may yet be influenced by perception on this issue. However, barring any changes, all eyes seem set for 11th March. Charles Bovaird contributed reporting. Lost confusion image via Shutterstock

Cloudflare, which provides denial-of-service protection, detailed the issue in a blog post published today. The company was first contacted about the bug last week by Google cybersecurity researcher Tavis Ormandy. The so-called ""Cloudbleed"" bug – a reference to 2014's Heartbleed vulnerability –  is believed to have begun affecting services as early as September 2016, enabling the leak of memory that included sensitive information such as passwords and authentication tokens. The firm said the bug has since been patched. News of the bug has triggered warnings from exchanges like Poloniex and Kraken, which suggested that users change their passwords, two-factor authentication and API keys. More broadly, cybersecurity advocates have strongly encouraged users of any site that utilizes Cloudflare to change their passwords as a precaution. According to Cloudflare’s blog post, the real threat to users came as a result of some of that information being captured by search engines. The firm explained: A user on GitHub has curated a list of sites potentially affected by the bug, which includes industry services like Coinbase, BitPay, Blockchain and LocalBitcoins. Other major websites, including Reddit, Uber and OKCupid, are said to be affected as well. CoinDesk will continue monitoring this developing story. Image via Shutterstock

There, members of Accenture, Deloitte, EY, KPMG and PWC joined blockchain startup ConsenSys to discuss the future of the industry and to provide career advice to students on the cusp of beginning their professional careers. While no companies provided new insight into their public strategies, their off-the-cuff remarks shed light on how traditional financial institutions are becoming more comfortable with the increasingly nuanced technology. When given an opportunity to address the crowd, Subhankar Sinha, a PwC fintech director, told students that the best way to get involved in the industry is to buy and hold bitcoin and ethereum. Sinha told the crowd: Elsewhere, there was discussion about how the industry might evolve. An introduction from Fordham professor Dr Frank Hsu outlined the history of blockchain, drawing analogies to the TCP/IP protocol – an internet technology developed in 1983, but that did not gain mainstream adoption until 1995. ""Using that framework, blockchain, started in 2008, should gain mainstream status by 2020,"" he said. Panelist Chris Broderson, Capital Markets researcher at Accenture, focused on healthcare, stating that cryptographic technology will allow medical records to be easily stored and transferred via blockchain applications while also reducing fraud. Finally, panelist Vanessa Grellet, an ethereum executive and chair of Nexus Impact Investing Group, predicted that blockchain will disrupt the legal, financial services and remittance industries. She ended with an appeal to students: ""Follow your passion, doing something you love, stick with something for two to three years to build expertise and knowledge in your field."" And stressing the passion that those in the industry have for the technology, panelist and EY financial services manager Mike Maloney said: Image by Michael del Castillo for CoinDesk

                            Bitcoin Price Sets New All-Time High                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-sets-new-time-high/," The price of bitcoin has reached a new all-time high. Bitcoin prices hit a high of $1,172.09, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) – surpassing a level first set more than three years ago in November 2013, when the BPI reported an average price high of $1,165.89. The move followed a morning of price gains, coming amid the longest period ever in which bitcoin's value has stayed above $1,000. Prices first began to inch upward today at 9:00 UTC on Wednesday, with bitcoin prices reaching a high of $1,100, staying above that level since. Today's price high represents an increase of more than 4% since the start of the day's trading. At press time, the average price of bitcoin is $1,170.72, BPI data shows. A number of factors have buoyed prices – and positive trader sentiment – in recent weeks. Perhaps most notably, traders have taken a largely bullish tack on the prospects that the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will approve the first-ever bitcoin ETF. The SEC has a deadline of 11th March to make their final decision, which has already been subject to delays. The surge past the all-time high also follows a period of uncertainty and change within the global bitcoin market. January's defining markets storyline was the growing involvement of the People's Bank of China, China's central bank, in the domestic bitcoin exchange space. A warning issued to exchanges led to the imposition of trading fees and, later, withdrawal delays at China's leading bourses. That month opened with a push above the $1,000 line, though the days to follow would see a dramatic fall back below that figure. Image via Shutterstock

The code was made publicly available on GitHub on 22nd February. The project, which has been around since 2015, is somewhat akin to Bitnodes, the node data tool operated by startup 21 Inc that seeks to map the bitcoin network by measuring the amount of nodes connected at any given time. As detailed in a 2015 presentation by developer Andrew Miller at the Scaling Bitcoin workshop in Montreal, the tool's aim isn't to reduce the anonymity of nodes on the network. Rather, according to Miller, CoinScope's purpose is to provide a vehicle to assess the health of the network itself. The white paper drafted in connection with CoinScope describes how one using the tool can see the bitcoin network in a new way by uncovering relationships between nodes and mining pools – a process that yields intriguing data points about the network's composition. The paper notes: The main technological aspect that makes the decloaking possible through the CoinScope tool is an element dubbed AddressNode. It works by discovering peer-to-peer links in bitcoin, then applying those links to the live topology of the whole network. Image via Shutterstock

                            Faster Than Lightning? 'Sprite' Paper Envisions New Bitcoin Payments                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/faster-than-lightning-sprite-proposes-new-design-for-bitcoin-payments/," Announced in early 2015, the Lightning Network, has been heralded as a promising solution to bitcoin's scaling challenges – one that, over the past year, has been inching closer to launch. However, a new paper has laid out the framework for another payment system that researchers claim would be even faster. Payment channels such as those proposed by the Lightning Network are one strand of the debate over scaling bitcoin which, although it often takes the form of arguments over block size, is ultimately about the volume of transactions the network can handle in a given length of time. Larger block size is one way to improve transaction volume, but another strategy is to conduct payments 'off-chain', that is, in private payment channels between two or more parties where only the final balance is broadcast back to the main blockchain. The authors of the new paper, titled ""Sprites: Payment Channels that Go Faster than Lightning"", claim that the Lightning Network's design is ""more complicated than necessary"" and assert that Sprite channels can reduce the maximum transaction time taken when each link in the transaction path suffers from a worst-case delay. The idea of designing for worst-case scenarios is key to the Sprite proposal, which comes into its own in conditions such as disputes between parties in a payment channel. Andrew Miller, assistant professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and co-author of the paper, said: Since the Lightning Network explicitly aims to facilitate cross-channel payments between parties who don't have a direct channel set up between them, a strategy to mitigate these kind of delays could be a significant advantage. However, for the time being, the mechanism needed to implement the Sprite micropayment channels makes use of functions that cannot currently be executed in bitcoin script (but could be run on the ethereum blockchain). That means that implementing the system on the bitcoin network would require a soft fork to add new codes to the script, just as other proposals such as SegWit would do. ""It's straightforward to imagine how a soft fork to support this behavior would go, but at the moment that's not a soft fork that's been proposed yet,"" Miller said. Still, with the paper now released, he did point out the possibility of other researchers finding a way to implement the Sprites system without requiring an extension to the bitcoin script. Meanwhile, Miller confirmed that the authors of the paper are already in contact with the Lightning team, who have been providing feedback and analysis of the proposal. At the same time, they have hopes that the Raiden network (the ethereum equivalent of Lightning) will be able to incorporate the Sprite technique in the near future. Patrick McCorry, co-author of the Sprites paper and cryptocurrency researcher at Newcastle University, said: In a final comment, Miller voiced the opinion that developing solutions for bitcoin first and then porting out to other crytocurrencies could hinder progress, since researchers have to contend with the quirks of bitcoin code. ""Our recommendation is that people try to express new ideas in either simple abstractions like pseudo code, or in ethereum because it's an easier example of what's possible, and then do the backward compatibility to fit with bitcoin today,"" he said, adding: Correction: An early version of this article misstated when the Lightning project was announced.

Immediately prior to reporting, global average prices had reached a high for the session of around $1,137, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Notably, that figure is less than $30 below the maximum ever value of $1,165.89 set on 30th November, 2013. The latest increase comes soon after bitcoin's longest ever period at over $1,000, and a notable period of volatility in recent months. The highs also reflect confidence by traders and investors in an industry that has been somewhat rocked by moves by the Chinese central bank to restrict the actions of the country's bitcoin exchanges, causing a number of them to temporarily freeze withdrawals of the cryptocurrency in recent weeks. Also lurking in the background, and possibly having an influence on price, is the imminent SEC decision on the Winklevoss brothers' bitcoin ETF – an event some experts have told CoinDesk that traders are already 'pricing in' a potential approval. The 11th March ruling could see the approval of the first bitcoin ETF in the US market, opening the digital currency to a wider audience of investors. However, many in the industry do not see a high likelihood of approval by the financial regulator. For more historical data and charts, visit the CoinDesk BPI here. Trading chart via Shutterstock

As reported by Berlingske, a new toolkit has reportedly enabled law enforcement officials in Denmark to press forward in cases involving the digital currency. The Danish National Police Cyber Crime Center (NC3) is said to be the department responsible for developing the tracking software. According to the report, NC3's new breakthrough has attracted interested from the FBI and Interpol. The cases involved Danish individuals buying large amounts of methamphetamine, ketamine and cocaine via darknet markets and shipping narcotics through the mail. Authorities intercepted the packages prior to the defendants receiving them. The mailing addresses were then reportedly used to trace the bitcoin transactions. Kim Aarenstrup, head of NC3, told the publication: The digital currency – and its use among criminal elements – has been on the Danish police's radar as a strategic threat since as early as 2015, public records show. According to a loose translation, officials expressed concern in an assessment from that year that the tech could enable money launderers to both obscure the source of funds as well as operate outside of a more strictly hierarchical criminal structure. Outside of that, there is evidence to suggest a possible merit to the claims. Experts have long sought to make known that bitcoin is pseudonymous, meaning that identities on the network itself as tied to addresses rather than names or other kinds of personal information. Concerns about transaction tracking have spurred interest in privacy centric currencies like monero (XMR) among the world's dark markets. Image via Shutterstock

West Virginia House Bill 2585, introduced yesterday, updates the state's money laundering statutes in several ways, including the addition of a definition for ""cryptocurrency"", which it then includes in the state's definition of a ""monetary instrument"". While stopping short of deeming it money, the inclusion is a notable one given the recent push among state legislatures to draft new laws around the technology. As the bill states: Those convicted of money laundering in West Virginia face as many as 15 years in prison depending on the charge, as well as thousands of dollars in fines. Public records indicate that the measure has strong support among members of the legislature, with a total of 11 sponsors and co-sponsors signed on, according to data from LegiScan. The bill has been sent to the West Virginia House Judiciary Committee for further deliberation. Representatives in Arizona, North Dakota and other US states have pursued a raft of proposals since the start of the year, though the West Virginia bill is the first recent one to focus directly on money laundering.

The official, Aleksandra Wiktorow,Â told local radio broadcaster Polskie RadioÂ that her office has filed an official letter to the ministry in which it said that Polandâs cryptocurrency market is experiencing rapid growth and should be subject to regulations that would protect customers of cryptocurrency exchanges. Wiktorow pointed out that, currently, the sector is not subject to any regulations in Poland. The finance ministry should evaluate and compare the best practices from those countries that have regulated cryptocurrencies, and implement the best instruments, she said. However, she added the caveat that the regulations âshould not be excessiveâ. The Financial Ombudsmanâs office is planning to publish a report in Q2 of 2017Â on the impact of new technologies on financial services, including cryptocurrencies. The report mayÂ include the institutionâs recommendations forÂ potential regulations that could be appliedÂ to the sector. Wiktorowâs statementÂ is the latest in a number ofÂ recent efforts to bring regulation to the Polish cryptocurrency industry. Last October, the lower chamber of Polandâs Parliament hosted the country's first public consultationÂ that was devoted solely to cryptocurrencies and blockchain tech. The conference was accompanied by the launch of a working paper that called for the Ministry of Finance to release a tax interpretation coveringÂ cryptocurrenciesÂ and to issue relevant regulation for startups.

The web platform, which connects lenders and borrowers to facilitate the distribution of loans denominated in bitcoin, received the new funding largely from a group of angel investors, some of whom already have stakes in the startup. The round was led by Şekip Can Gökalp, founder of Mobilike, a Turkey-based mobile ad network formed in 2009, and that was acquired last year. Other investors include Janis Zech and Andreas Bodczek, who founded ad tech startup Fyber, and Alexander Graubner-Müller, co-founder and CEO of Germany-based online lender Kreditech.

BitLendingClub announced in early December that it would, over the months ahead, begin closing down parts of its business, citing an unfriendly regulatory environment. When reached for comment at the time, CEO Kiril Gantchev cited contacts with the Bulgarian government – and pending regulatory requirements – as the major impetus behind the site’s decision to to close. BitLendingClub is expected to completely halt services sometime in August. Fellow P2P bitcoin market BTCJam, also citing regulatory concerns, moved to exit the US market last year.

                            Bitcoin Price Tops $1,000 For Longest Stretch in History                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-tops-1000-longest-stretch-history/," Bitcoin has now been trading above $1,000 for more than seven days, enjoying its longest-ever stretch above this key psychological level and providing traders with new evidence of support at this price, CoinDesk data reveals. Overall, the price of bitcoin has been trading north of $1,000 since mid-day on 14th February, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), though it tested this level at times over the seven-day, 15-hour stretch. Bitcoin prices have even rallied in the last few sessions, surpassing $1,100 earlier today and reaching a six-week high. At the time of the report, bitcoin was trading at $1,115.70, up 3% for the day. Looking back, the current run compares favorably to other positive periods of bitcoin trading, dating back to 2013, when it first tested highs above $1,000. Bitcoin prices remained above $1,000 for roughly two days from 29th November to 30th November that year, and again from 3rd December to 4th December, periods that saw huge volatility in the bitcoin price. Bitcoin prices 1st November, 2013 to 1st January, 2014  Prior to this run, bitcoin's longest period above $1,000 was from 2nd February to 9th February of this year, when it may have spent as much as six days, 23 hours above the mark. Data from the BPI suggests that during this period, the price may have fallen below $1,000 on single exchanges, though averages were higher. Data from 3rd February, for instance, indicates a low of $995.87. Bitcoin prices 2nd February to 9th February, 2017  In the meantime, it remains to be seen how strong the support for bitcoin above $1,000 will be. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, spoke to this strong performance, noting that traders have so far strongly resisted any movements back below this mark. ""The only pullback we've seen on the rise above $1,000 is from $1,070 to $1,040, which is a healthy sign of bullishness,"" he said. Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff said that he believes the price is more stable than it was both in January of this year and in 2013. ""That's not saying much though. I remain very worried about the state of bitcoin's development and culture, and I won't be at all surprised if we drop back to $900 or $800 in the next few months,"" he said. Eliosoff emphasized the ongoing developments surrounding Chinese exchange withdrawals and the upcoming SEC decision about the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF were two big points of uncertainty. ""After the dust settles on those, one way or another, price stability should come a little easier,"" he said. Space satellite image via Shutterstock

California Senate Bill 741, submitted late last week by Senator Tony Mendoza, creates the regulatory framework for ""private, nonprofit organizations"" that would govern how these entities are able to hold raffles at sporting events, county fairs and other public venues. Notably, the measure would ban bitcoin from use as payment in those sanctioned raffles. The bill states: The measure goes on to prohibit the use of the internet to either conduct or sell tickets for a raffle, indicating that California lawmakers want to limit such events to physical locations. While not outlined in the bill, it's possible that cybersecurity and identity issues are behind the push. The language mirrors a bill that amended the rules for sports organizations wishing to hold a raffle. That measure, too, prohibited the use of bitcoin for this purpose. The bill cleared the state legislature and was approved by the governor's office in late 2015. SB 741 represents the latest legislative move related to bitcoin and blockchain in recent weeks, with lawmakers in states like North Dakota, Arizona and Hawaii, all weighing in on different bills related to the tech.

                            Bitcoin Prices Hit Six-Week High as Traders Await ETF Decision                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-prices-edge-1100-etf-decision-approaches/," The price of bitcoin continued to inch closer to annual highs set in January today, as prices for the asset passed $1,100 across global exchanges. At press time, bitcoin was trading at $1,105.18, its highest total since 5th January – the day its most recent price rally collapsed, falling $200 in one hour. The drop, credited by some to the over-influence of leverage in the market, later sparked an investigation into the market by the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank.  However, traders are looking elsewhere in an effort to understand this latest price rise.  Sources told CoinDesk today that they believe the price increase is the result of traders ""pricing in"" an 11th March ruling that could see the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF become the first bitcoin ETF in the US market, opening the digital currency to a wider audience of investors. OTC trader Zhao Dong credited the increase to ""optimism about the ETF approval"", as did exchange operators and market analysts. Not everyone is optimistic about the path ahead, however.  Blockchain consultant and advisor George Samman, for example, expects the price to edge downward prior to the approval, as traders look to sell ahead of a possible rejection. Research from investment analyst Needham & Co has found that the bitcoin ETF has a less than 25% chance of being approved.  Still, the research firm projects that bitcoin prices could rise dramatically on the off-chance a positive decision is made, perhaps prompting demand for bitcoin in advance of this date.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered exclusively to our subscribers.  A relatively quiet and traditionally isolated market is about to set a precedent that could change the blockchain sector. Last week, CoinDesk met with a group of representatives from some of Japan’s blockchain startups and enterprise players. Conversation revolved around the upcoming regulation of cryptocurrencies, and the impact it would have on industry business models. The consensus seemed to be that the new rules (a requirement to get a license from the Financial Services Agency, register with the anti-money laundering authorities and submit to periodic audits and inspections) would be good for the sector. Bestowing legitimacy will get both people and businesses more comfortable with alternative currencies, increasing volume, investment and network effects. But that's not to say there isn't a cost. One of the main risks is that the legislation ends up having the same effect as New York’s 'BitLicense', driving out businesses and stagnating the local ecosystem. And while you could argue that the additional stability and security is worth the loss of innovation and choice, the resulting consolidation is a step towards centralization in a sector based on decentralization. On the other hand, a likely consequence is that large financial firms will take an interest in the cryptocurrency business, looking to diversify their offerings and broaden their client base. Already, finance giant SBI has invested in exchanges BitFlyer and Kraken, and announced plans to set up its own. FX broker Money Partners Group invested in TechBureau. GMO Internet set up a cryptocurrency wallet. And, this week, three of Japan’s largest financial institutions participated in BitFlyer’s latest funding round. The inflow of institutional funds will not only add liquidity and respectability to the sector. It will also give startups the impetus to both strengthen their business at home and grow internationally. While that impact will be significant, a potentially more far-reaching one will be the change in banking practices that could result. We see frequent reports of bitcoin startups in other high-tech, allegedly innovative, financial centers having to shut down because banks won’t work with them. Here, we have banks actually investing in or creating bitcoin businesses. The example set by Japanese banks could encourage a new tone in the global cryptocurrency sector. We have become used to seeing banks dedicate resources and attention to blockchain projects. Although some have started experimenting on private versions of public blockchains, on the whole, banks have stayed away from bitcoin and its peers. An increased interest in a different store of value, combined with a focus on improved processes, could lead to new innovations and use cases. To put this into perspective, we are looking at the potential symbiosis of two sectors that are both global leaders. Tokyo is one of the top five financial centers worldwide. Furthermore, Japan recently overtook China as the largest bitcoin market. Could this lead to a 'co-opting' of alternatives to fiat by the gatekeepers of the fiat system? Possibly, but the question misses the point. An eventual mingling of the two was always inevitable, either as a stepping stone or as an end goal. If the example set by Japan spreads, we could be at the threshold of that phase. This will imply a cultural shift on both sides. However, the fundamentals of bitcoin are unlikely to change. The fundamentals of traditional banking could. Red and blue paint splash via Shutterstock

To set things straight from the beginning, I don’t have a bust of the former British Prime Minister in my office. For one thing, he was rather off on his views of Mahatma Gandhi, the most influential British subject of the 20th Century. The reason that this remark endures is obvious. We as a global community find ourselves in an accelerating centrifuge of crises that are economic, political and ultimately moral all at once. The way out can seem to be more elusive at each turn. ""Stop the world: I want to get off"" isn’t an option yet, although Elon Musk is working on that one. Disruptions abound. Disruption of the ecosystem, disruption of the political order, disruption of institutions and disruption of societies. (There are many ways to skin this cat, including this one from McKinsey Global Institute.) These disruptions have created another crisis of a fundamental and corrosive kind: the loss of trust. Why put faith in political classes who are raised, schooled and nakedly represent vested interests engaged in 'socially useless' activity? Why be surprised when public institutions that are mandated to protect and promote human rights go on to intrude into personal privacy and lawful behaviour? Why trust large private businesses, that cultivate prospects through sophisticated psychographic and behavioral marketing, in order to sell goods and services that poison you and your children? We stare at a world at war where the theatre of conflict isn’t just far away Abyssinia or Czechoslovakia or Manchuria or Spain. Or Iraq or Syria. Today the theatre of war is everywhere. Refugees might justifiably argue that “we are here because you were there,” but it’s become even more invidious than this. The theatre is you and me, and it is being fought on an increasingly intimate terrain. If you’re reading this on your personal device, the war is happening in the palm of your hand through the likely encroachment of your privacy. Right now. It isn’t easy for good people to turn their back on struggling or compromised institutions, or to be wary of something as close to us as our personal device. We grow up with them as part of our lives. We invest in them with the expectation that they will invest in us, or deliver benefits to us. They are part of who we are. At least this is the working assumption in relatively developed societies. The story has been rather different in the majority of the world where countries and communities struggle daily to hold things together. For the governments and peoples living in least-development countries, landlocked least-developed countries, and small-island developing states, crisis was the new normal decades ago. Now spare a thought for women, men and children in territories wracked by conflict, with no government or business sector or rule of law. Institutional crisis in specific jurisdictions has become a crisis of institutions everywhere. Trust, a commodity that requires careful handling, is in peril. And it is not surprising that this prompts over-reaction towards extremes. For some, public institutions are to blame, therefore we need to turn our back on them and go full-libertarian. To others, private interests can be just as malevolent, or incompetent, or both, therefore we need the state to restore order. We can have sympathy for both outlooks, but the solutions arising from each side can descend quickly into dogma. Neither help. What we need is a negotiated middle ground that makes sense for present and future generations. This middle ground belongs to a shared agenda powered by innovation. Two developments since the 2007–2008 economic crisis can, in my view, help and help enormously. They both have some things in common: they both emerged from a hot mess and they are both still in their infancy. At first glance, they both seem implausible. They both face a challenge to pass the giggle test in an age where fear, uncertainty and doubt prevail. They also share qualities that are altogether more positive. They promise a better world. They are the products of long experience and ingenuity. They are both brilliant in their design. Chronologically, the first was bitcoin, which emerged in 2009. The second is the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Sustainable Development Goals. Here are the goals in brief: Is there a single one of these 17 goals, or any of their 169 targets, where bitcoin cannot improve prospects? The answer may not be immediately obvious. I expect that entrepreneurs, researchers, policy makers and institutions will be asking and acting on this question over the coming years. The space is ripe for investment. The origins of bitcoin lie in code and cryptography. In its early adoption, it has attracted the attention of bona fide entrepreneurs operating in a gray regulatory area prone to over-reaction, plus speculators and criminals. In the space of eight years, bitcoin (and its underlying protocol) has grown to the extent that central banks around the world and large financial institutions have begun to take serious notice. This is good. Still, while its ecosystem is growing, many of its use cases are still hypothetical or untested, and some advocates are prone to wishful thinking. A few betray a whiff of technological fundamentalism. Meanwhile, the Sustainable Development Goals arose in 2015 after sustained political debate and empirical evidence on what has and has not worked to improve the lot of people and planet. Their number and complexity is an admission that the world we live in is interdependent. Long-term fixes in one location can have positive effects elsewhere. For those skeptical of the ability of public and private institutions to come together to agree on an agenda this bold, the Sustainable Development Goals are a major source of inspiration and hope. They enjoy traction in an otherwise distracted world. Bringing bitcoin and the Sustainable Development Goals together will take an act of loving midwifery. It will require patience, cultivation and evidence. On this, we have precedence. It took more than 20 years for the development and environment communities to come together and agree on terms of engagement. Why so long? There are many reasons, of course. Development as a profession privileges planners and economists who occasionally stumble into history, sociology and anthropology to understand lived realities. Environmental proponents tend to be natural scientists and activists. These represent different, sometimes parallel cultures. It can take mega-trends or external shocks to force convergence. In the meantime, conservatism holds sway. Received wisdom, self-interest and a lack of lateral awareness dictate priorities and behaviour. It can be a bemusing spectacle and we must expect more of the same. Any effort to bring bitcoin into the Sustainable Development Goals will require an appreciation of how to achieve successful convergence between communities of interest. It will take communication, experimentation and demonstration of value. Bitcoin is beginning to hint at intrinsic value, to the extent that its protocol has the potential to deliver material value to state, society, economy and individual. Some argue that the ‘S-curve of technology adoption’, characterized by fractals repeating, exponentially increasing Gartner Hype Cycles, might in time force convergence. Perhaps. At the same time, we should not underestimate the political economy of technology adoption. It does not yet have the social capital that say, gold, enjoys. Its extrinsic value is still moot. This makes it vulnerable and a risky bet. For now, it isn’t so much the old imperialist Churchill from whom we can draw inspiration. Instead, it’s the wily Gandhi and his vision of the autonomous human being, free from encumbrance and able to pursue life to its full potential. Born in the wake of crisis, the Sustainable Development Goals shape that course, and I believe bitcoin can drive it.

                            Bitcoin Hash Functions Explained                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hash-functions-explained/,"Anyone with an interest in bitcoin will have heard the phrase 'cryptographic hash function' at some time or other. But what exactly does it mean, and how is it connected to cryptocurrency? Hash functions are an essential part of, not only of the bitcoin protocol, but of information security as a whole. In the following article we'll take a look at some simple examples of how they work, with a simple demonstration, too. In the abstract, a hash function is a mathematical process that takes input data of any size, performs an operation on it, and returns output data of a fixed size. In a more concrete example, this can be used to take a sequence of letters of any length as input – what we call a string – and return a sequence of letters of a fixed length. Whether the input string is a single letter, a word, a sentence, or an entire novel, the output – called the digest – will always be the same length. A common use of this kind of hash function is to store passwords. When you create a user account with any web service which requires a password, the password is run through a hash function, and the hash digest of the message is stored. When you type in your password to log in, the same hash function is run on the word you've entered, and the server checks whether the result matches the stored digest. This means that if a hacker is able to access the database containing the stored hashes, they will not be able to immediately compromise all user accounts because there is no easy way to find the password which produced any given hash. You can experiment with hash values using Python, a programming language installed on Mac and Linux operating systems by default. (This tutorial will assume you're using some version of either OS X or Linux, as using Python on Windows is more complicated.) First, open a terminal, type python and hit ENTER. This will put you into the Python REPL, an environment where you can try out Python commands directly as opposed to writing a programme in a separate file. Then, type the following, pressing ENTER after each line, and TAB where marked: You have now created a function, hash(), which will calculate and print out the hash value for a given string using the MD5 hashing algorithm. To run it, put a string in between the parentheses in quotation marks, eg: And press ENTER to see the hash digest of that string. You will see that calling the hash function on the same string will always generate the same hash, but adding or changing one character will generate a completely different hash value:   In the bitcoin protocol, hash functions are part of the block hashing algorithm which is used to write new transactions into the blockchain through the mining process. In bitcoin mining, the inputs for the function are all of the most recent, not-yet-confirmed transactions (along with some additional inputs relating to the timestamp and a reference to the previous block). In the code example above, we've already seen that changing a small part of the input for a hash function results in a completely different output. This property is crucial to the 'proof of work' algorithm involved in mining: to successfully 'solve' a block, miners try to combine all of the inputs with their own arbitrary piece of input data in such a way that the resulting hash starts with a certain number of zeroes. As a basic demonstration, we could try 'mining' with our Python hash function by manually adding exclamation points after ""CoinDesk rocks!"" until we find a hash that starts with a single zero.   Of course, solving the hash for a bitcoin block – which at the time of writing must start with 18 zeros – requires an extremely large amount of computation (and so the combined processing power of all the computers in the network still takes  approximately 10 minutes to solve a block). It's the need for this large amount of processing power that means new bitcoins get mined over a long period of time, not all at once. In order to earn bitcoins through mining, you need to put in the huge amount of work necessary to solve a block – and by earning that reward, you're locking in all of the new transactions into a block, which is added to the permanent record of all previous transactions: the blockchain. Any crypto basics you'd like explained next?

                            Altcoin Uptick Ends as Bitcoin Prices Pass $1,050                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/altcoin-bitcoin-prices-1050-uptick-over/," While so-called altcoins enjoyed a notable rally early this week, this run appears to be over. The market for alternative cryptocurrencies, a collection of digital tokens with different blockchain networks and value propositions than the bitcoin protocol, received significant tailwinds earlier this week as bitcoin traders sat on the sidelines waiting to hear the latest news from China. As bitcoin trading volumes fell at many exchanges, many of the top cryptocurrencies listed on CoinMarketCap (ranked by market capitalization) enjoyed notable price gains, forming what could be referred to as a smaller altcoin rally. Today, however, we saw a sharp reversal of this trend. The ether markets provided a perfect example. Ether, the digital currency that powers the smart contract-based blockchain platform ethereum, surged nearly 20% to $13.33 on CoinMarketCap on 14th February, reaching their highest value so far this year. Analysts pointed to robust trading volume, a highly leveraged market and signs of rising adoption as helping fuel this price rise. However, the digital currency has fallen back, dropping to $12.64 today. At the time of report, ether was trading at $12.71. Monero, a privacy-oriented digital currency that leverages ring signatures to conceal user identities, also provided strong evidence that the rally enjoyed by altcoins earlier this week is now over. The privacy oriented digital currency rose roughly 12% from $12.20 on 14th February to $13.74 on 15th February, its highest price in more than a month, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. However, monero lost much of its recent gains when it dropped to $13.26 later in the 15th February session, and failed to mount any notable recoveries since that time. Instead, the digital currency has moved largely within a reasonably tight range between $13.30 and $13.60. Elsewhere, dash, a digital currency that offers users privacy and instant transactions, rose 8.6% to $19.66 on 15th February, but fell back to $18.75 later that session, CoinMarketCap figures show. As for what caused the altcoin rally to end, one simple explanation is that cryptocurrency traders have once again become interested in bitcoin. Far and away the market's largest asset, bitcoin has seen its price climb more than 5% since falling to $1,001 early in the 15th February session, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data shows. At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,056.92, 2.2% higher for the data, BPI figures reveal.  This recent uptick in price has coincided with a notable increase in volume, as market participants traded 16,000 bitcoins worth of transactions through Bitfinex in the 24 hours through 21:30 UTC. This compares to an average of 9,700 bitcoins per session over the last seven days, Bitcoinity data shows.

Sponsored by state rep Barbara Biggie – with Representative Keith Ammon as a co-sponsor – the bill was passed along to the NH House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee.

                            Bitcoin Investor Roger Ver to Push for OKCoin Liquidation in Court                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-investor-roger-ver-to-push-for-okcoin-liquidation-in-court/,"Roger Ver’s fight against Chinese bitcoin exchange OKCoin is intensifying as the noted bitcoin investor attempts to have the business liquidated in a Hong Kong court. The move comes after months of legal wranglings that have already seen the exchange lose one court case. OKCoin's alleged lack of response to the judgement has now prompted Ver to take further action that could ultimately see the company closed. Ver first sued OKCoin in September, seeking $570,000 plus unspecified damages in a breach-of-contract suit tied to a dispute over the Bitcoin.com domain. That conflict deepened amid accusations of forgery, as well as impropriety on the part of OKCoin – allegations that exchange representatives swiftly denied. In the end, Ver went to court, suing OKCoin's Hong Kong entity. At the same time, Ver and attorney Daniel Kelman prepared a suit against the exchange, as well as its chief executive, Star Xu, over the alleged forgery of Ver’s signature. That suit is pending trial. According to court documents obtained by CoinDesk, OKCoin never responded in court to the breach-of-contract suit. On 17th November, the court handed down a final and interlocutory judgment awarding the $570,000 to Ver. Yet, according to Ver and Kelman, OKCoin has yet to respond to both the court's decision, as well as further entreaties. As such, the two say they intend to go ahead with a request for the Hong Kong court to liquidate OKCoin's local entity in a bid to obtain the funds. According to Kelman, a liquidation petition is currently being drawn up. He went on to explain: Documents provided to CoinDesk indicate that, after the November judgment, OKCoin’s legal representation in Hong Kong responded by letter on 23rd December, asking that they set aside the original court decision. According to Kelman, they sent a response in turn, requesting an offer – which they never received. A statutory demand letter was later served to OKCoin’s Hong Kong office on 24th January, reiterating the $570,000 judgment handed down by the court along with $13,867 in accrued interest. According to Ver, the exchange never responded to that letter, which was also sent to its legal representatives in Hong Kong. The delivery of that letter triggered a 21-day notice period, which ended this week on 13th February. When reached for comment, OKCoin said in a statement: The development marks the latest chapter in a dispute that, after exploding across social media last year, has largely faded from public view. Disclosed emails at the time portrayed an increasingly contentious back-and-forth between Ver and OKCoin representatives – a situation that worsened following the allegation of contract signature forgery, which Ver has since stressed is fact. Former OKCoin exec Changpeng Zhao later backed up Ver, going on to allege that the exchange inflated its trade volumes with bots and had manipulated the outcome of an audit conducted in August 2014. At the time, Xu provided several refutations of Zhao's claims. Amidst that environment, Ver pledged that he would take his case to court, formally filing suit in September. Things went quiet, while Ver turned Bitcoin.com into a bitcoin-focused content platform and mining pool and OKCoin continued with its exchange business. However, the latest developments could lever the situation into the public eye once again, depending on the court’s decision. If the request is successful, the court in Hong Kong will push the exchange into liquidation – and from there, the situation could become potentially messy. “[Then] their company in Hong Kong, that all their customers have an agreement [with], that all the customers trust with their money – regardless of who holds that money – the court is going to put them into liquidation and order all that money back and make everyone a creditor unless OKCoin actually shows up in court to settle this thing,” Kelman told CoinDesk. As for what will happen after that, the path is less certain. OKCoin owns business entities in China and Singapore, which could be impacted by the outcome in Hong Kong should the judge approve the liquidation. OKCoin may request that the suit be moved to China, where it keeps its headquarters. The timing of these latest developments arguably couldn't be worse for the firm. OKCoin has recently come under pressure – along with the rest of China’s cryptocurrency exchange sector – from regulators in the country, including the People’s Bank of China. Since then, OKCoin has ceased margin trading, added exchange fees and halted withdrawals pending upgrades to its internal systems. Image via Shutterstock

",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-forming-new-price-floor-1000/," Bitcoin appears to be stabilizing at a new price point. The value of tokens on the public blockchain protocol reached a high of $1,039 today, continuing their recent run of stability. At press time, bitcoin has been trading above $1,000 since mid-day on 14th February, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Yet, while promising, the digital currency may need to spend more time above this level before it becomes a new support, analysts told CoinDesk. Tim Enneking, chairman of digital asset hedge fund Crypto Asset Management, projected that if the market stays above $1,000 for the next few days, support at this level could be more plausible. Still, he indicated he expects momentum will build around this point. ""I'd be astonished if we fell below $1,000 barring any external event,"" he said. Vinny Lingham, former Bitcoin Foundation board member and CEO of identity startup Civic, however, voiced doubts about whether bitcoin could build support above the $1,000 mark. ""It certainly could, but I think it's unlikely,"" he told CoinDesk. Lingham has previously predicted that the digital currency will consolidate around $1,000 for the next month or two, clarifying today that he believes bitcoin prices will ""for the most part"" fluctuate within $50 of this level. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub, also emphasized that this price does not represent a ""huge support level"", but he was optimistic about the general trajectory. ""The more time price spends above $1,000, the stronger that support level becomes,"" he said.
 One upcoming test, he said, will be if the price declines to retest the $1,000 level, and bounces back above it, providing evidence of support, and potentially, a sign the market could further strengthen. Price charts image via Shutterstock

Reuters reports that representatives for Yuri Lebedev, one of the operators of the failed exchange, and Trevon Gross, a pastor who once ran a credit union allegedly involved in the scheme, portrayed their clients as unwitting accomplices, pointing the finger largely at Anthony Murgio, who plead guilty to several charges in January. Coin.mx was a bitcoin exchange based in Florida which operated as a so-called “Collectible’s Club”. The government has alleged that Coin.mx used this structure to obscure its exchange activities, asserting that the service was leveraged as part of a broader cybercrime ring tied to a series of 2014 hackings, including one attack on Wall Street giant JPMorgan. The trial was delayed briefly during jury selection after the prosecution pushed for a new witness. That request was ultimately denied by Judge Alison Nathan. During opening remarks, attorneys for the federal government highlighted the bribe allegedly given to Gross, who was charged last month. ""The bribes and lies had a simple, shared purpose: For the defendants Lebedev and Gross and their co-conspirators to make money,"" Assistant U.S. Attorney Won Shin was quoted as saying. By contrast, attorneys for Gross and Lebedev argued that their clients largely didn’t know what they were getting into. “Yuri was in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people,” Eric Creizman, who is representing Lebedev in the case, told the jury.

Specifically, Dashjr’s proposal suggested a temporary block size reduction to 300KB (dependent on the date that the BIP was activated), slowly rising in yearly increases to a limit of 31MB in 2045. The timing of the proposal, released on 27th January, came just days after a huge increase in transaction backlog saw unconfirmed transactions spike to over 60,000 before returning to lower levels. In a more detailed proposal, Dashjr cites the amount of disk space demanded by the blockchain – currently around 100GB – as a significant disincentive for anyone wanting to run a node, hardware that stores the full ledger history. Dashjr writes: The remarks are not surprising as the viability of bitcoin's node network has emerged as one of the more prominent political footballs in the debate. Without a vibrant node network, developers fear that the operation of bitcoin's ledgers will fall into the hands of a few big operators, thus defeating the purpose of a decentralized payment network. Although the proposed reduction is what has garnered most attention, the proposal actually calls for an annual block size increase of 17% per year, intended to keep pace with the growth rate in bandwidth seen in recent years. But critics of the ensuing discussion have suggested that this figure is overly conservative, and that it does not account for the non-linear pace of technological change – especially when projected into the future. In general, the proposal has seen little support from the wider community, with most responses on the mailing list expressing skepticism toward the proposal. The block size decrease might not have been the sole point of contention, however. Dashjr's proposal requires what's called a hard fork, a way to upgrade a blockchain that can split the network if not all participants agree. (Even this definition, it seems, remains contentious). Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau responded to argue that neither a block size increase nor a decrease is desirable. ""For me, both approaches just show the lack of creativity, and lack of responsibility,"" he said. He further expressed the common view that a hard fork would be too dangerous right now, adding: This might explain why even a modified version of the proposal, which removed the block size decrease, released on 5th February by developer Andrew Chow, failed to generate enthusiasm from list members. Discussing his proposal and the response with CoinDesk, Dashjr cited a Twitter poll that showed 20% support for a block size decrease – far from a majority, but a large enough number to merit serious consideration. However, he also pointed out the difficulty of moving forward with modifications to the network when a supermajority of hashing power is required to accept them. He said: In light of the community's response, Dashjr said that he did not intend to develop the BIP draft any further at the present time, and would not be pursuing it to the point of receiving an official proposal number. If there really is 20% support for a reduction in block size, though, some of Dashjr's ideas may still reemerge through other channels in future. Tiny food image via Shutterstock

                            China's BTCC Becomes Latest Bitcoin Exchange to Freeze Withdrawals                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/china-btcc-exchange-halt-withdrawals/,"Shanghai-based bitcoin exchange BTCC has announced that it will halt bitcoin and other cryptocurrency withdrawals for one month.  The news, posted to its website today, comes one week after Huobi and OKCoin, two of the country's 'Big Three' exchanges alongside BTCC, revealed they would prohibit cryptocurrency withdrawals as part of an effort to combat money laundering at the request of China's central bank. At the time, BTCC said it would undertake a similar upgrade, but that it would only take 72 hours to complete. According to the update, however, BTCC plans to continue the audit of its system, with the goal of ending the process on 15th March.  The statement reads: The announcement comes on the heels of a decline in volume across China-based exchanges, and an apparent exodus of domestic traders to alternative platforms.  Data from Bitcoinity shows the sharp reduction in volume over the last 30 days, spurred by exchange policy changes requested by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) beginning in January.

Likewise, data from Bitcoin Charts indicates volume at BTCC has declined in recent weeks. At the time of reporting, the market seemed apathetic about the news, with bitcoin prices trending higher for the day across US dollar and Chinese yuan markets. CNY prices were up 8%, though as reported by CoinDesk, local traders are no longer confident that domestic exchange prices reflect the true cost of the asset. Overall, most are suggesting that announcements will continue as China grapples with its rule-making for bitcoin more broadly. Zennon Kapron, author of ""Chomping at the Bitcoin: The Past, Present and Future of Bitcoin in China"", suggested the domestic industry will likely be in for a long road of changes. ""In the end, these exchanges need to be connected to and sharing data with PBoC's SAFE,"" he said. ""That would give them the surveillance to ensure that people aren't moving more than their yearly $50,000 limit of money out and cover any AML concerns."" He suggested that this could be one possible long-term solution, and potentially, a way to illustrate that bitcoin is not as widely used for capital flight as feared.

                            Crypto Traders Flock to Altcoins Amid Bitcoin Price Malaise                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/crypto-traders-flock-altcoins-amid-bitcoin-market-malaise/," With many crypto traders sitting on the sidelines and awaiting news from China, volumes for bitcoin, the market's most highly traded asset, have seen a decline. Market participants traded 6,670 bitcoins through Bitfinex, one of the world's largest exchanges by volume, in the 24 hours through roughly 21:30 UTC today, more than 50% less than the daily average of 17,900 bitcoins over the last week. Likewise, volume has declined at major Chinese exchanges Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC, all exchanges whose policies have been affected by directives from that country's central bank. Against this backdrop, bitcoin's price has stabilized, fluctuating between a daily high of $1,011 reached at 01:15 UTC and a session low of $1,001.00 hit at 07:00 UTC, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The 14th February session provided a similar story, as bitcoin prices moved within a slightly larger range between $987.33 and $1,106.44, additional BPI figures reveal. The rangebound trading that bitcoin has experienced may form part of a broader trend, according to Vinny Lingham, market analyst and CEO of identity startup Civic. Lingham told CoinDesk: While some might embrace such a period of lower volatility, this reduction in price movement also results in fewer opportunities for traders to profit from the cryptocurrency's price swings. But while bitcoin's market has settled, many other cryptographic assets have received tailwinds from the development. At the time of report, eight out of the top 10 cryptocurrencies on CoinMarketCap (listed in terms of market capitalization) were higher for the day, with monero and dash having experienced the most notable gains. Monero, a token that powers a blockchain that leverages digital signatures to help preserve the privacy of its users, rose to $13.74 during the session, more than 5.6% higher than the currency's price of $13.01 at 12:04 UTC, CoinMarketCap figures reveal. At the time of report, monero's token, XMR, was trading at $13.61, 4.6% higher for the session.  Data provided by cryptocurrency trading platform Whaleclub shows the benefit that this particular altcoin has derived as a result of traders' lack of interest in bitcoin. ""We've seen lower volume (both shorts and longs) in the past few days on BTC/USD, with traders moving on to other markets which offer greater volatility,"" Petar Zivkovski, COO for Whaleclub, told CoinDesk. He singled out monero's XMR token in particular, indicating that ""we see some volume flocking"" to this privacy-oriented digital currency. Dash, a digital currency that offers users privacy and instant transactions, also pushed higher in 15th February. The cryptocurrency climbed to $19.66 during the session, 8.6% higher than the currency’s price of $18.10 at 12:04 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of report, dash had fallen to $19.23, representing a 6.2% increase for the day.  Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, offered similar sentiment. ""We are also moving a bit of money into altcoins,"" he told CoinDesk. His take is that this is just the latest example of traders investing in smaller digital currencies when bitcoin prices remain rangebound. Penguin image via Shutterstock

As reported last week by CoinDesk, North Dakotaâs legislature has taken up a measure that, if passed, would mandate a study into how the state could approach putting together a legislative framework for the tech. Bill 2100 was submitted at the request of financial regulators at the end of last year, passing unanimously in the State Senate on 12th February. From there, it advanced to the North Dakota House of Representatives, the state legislatureâs lower chamber, being taken up by the Industry, Business and Labor Committee. Lawmakers convened a hearing on the bill yesterday, and while a video of the hearing was not immediately available at press time, local reports indicate that regulators want to see action on the legislative level due to interest from companies looking to open for business in the state. Aaron Webb, assistant commissioner for the stateâs Department of Financial Institutions, was quoted as saying by local news outlet KFYR: Yet according to the outlet, the committee currently considering the measure isnât on board with it. That body reportedly gave it a unanimous Do Not Pass recommendation â a determination that could either result in changes to the bill or a decision to abandon it entirely.

                            Will New Regulations Help or Hurt Bitcoin Startups in the Philippines?                        ",Luis Buenaventura,https://www.coindesk.com/will-new-regulations-help-hurt-bitcoin-startups-philippines/,"Luis Buenaventura is CTO of BloomSolutions, a Philippines-based remittance firm, and the author of the e-book ""Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin"". In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Buenaventura gives his take on new regulations aimed at bitcoin businesses in the Philippines. Cost burden aside, he argues, there's reason for entrepreneurs to be optimistic about the changes.  With everyone from Abra to ZipZap using it as either a launch market or a base of regional operations, the Philippines has long been the hub of innovation for bitcoin remittance companies. Local founders have said it was only a matter of time before the central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), would come around to regulating the industry, and that process finally began in early February of this year. That's when when BSP deputy governor Nestor Espenilla announced the central bank would issue a circular that intended to clear up the government's position on bitcoin and other cryptocurrency exchanges.  At the time, Espenilla noted that monthly domestic bitcoin volumes in the Philippines had jumped from $1m in 2015, to $5m–$6m the following year, and it was time for guidelines. That circular is now available (BSP Circular No 944), and will take effect by the end of the month.  On the surface, the circular appears to take some of its cues from the Japanese Financial Services Agency, which published its own set of regulations for bitcoin exchanges last year, and that take effect this April. But, there are differences as well. Overall, the preamble emphasizes the BSP's position around encouraging innovation and financial inclusion – a welcome, if somewhat perfunctory, statement in light of what else the circular contains. The release reads: That's not to say the circular is without its weak spots. Because of the way Philippine startups have been using bitcoin over the past three years, it appears that the BSP has latched on to this single use case more than any other.  The BSP does not appear to have a regulatory position on virtual currencies as an investment, a payment rail, a gambling platform or as a mechanism for offshoring personal assets – all of which are more common use cases for the technology than remittances. And what exactly is a virtual currency, in the eyes of the central bank? Here, the BSP is casting an extremely broad net. Perhaps it’s in the interest of efficiency – these guidelines cover both centralized and decentralized currencies, blockchain-based or not.  It potentially also covers technology that doesn’t even exist yet, as it’s not entirely clear what it even means to 'manufacture' a virtual currency. But, the BSP does take care to distinguish 'virtual currencies' from 'mobile money' – Warcraft gold, Starbucks points and frequent-flier miles. (In the Philippines, mobile money is covered by a different, arguably more stringent, set of regulations.) Elsewhere, the definition of 'virtual currency exchange' proves tricky. For one, it does not just cover 'VC exchanges' in the way one would expect. It's been written to include bitcoin wallets and bitcoin payment processors – indeed, any service that facilitates currency conversion. (A wallet provider would be exempt if they did not exchange bitcoin for fiat, but those types of services would have little use in the Philippines.) Virtual currency exchanges will further have to obtain a certificate of registration (CoR) with the Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat, and also pay annual service fees. The document it refers to is a previous circular (No 942), which breaks down the various fees that need to be paid. In most cases, the registration fees come out to a little over $2,000, with annual service fees amounting to the same. Essentially, all VC exchanges are now to be treated as remittance companies. On the face of it, a first-year fee of $2,000 is no higher than any traditional money services business in the Philippines would be expected to pay, so it’s not altogether unfair.  The bigger challenge will be figuring out how to incorporate the mandatory compliance and reporting workflow without affecting costs. In most cases, this would involve hiring additional personnel and retaining legal advice. So what does this mean for the bitcoin industry in the Philippines? Overall, it’s good news that the government is finally recognizing startups that have been laboring in a legal gray area since 2013. It’s also encouraging that they’ve spent enough time to learn about bitcoin to understand what it’s good at. It certainly appears like the intention is to treat any business dealing with bitcoin as a remittance agent, even if remittances aren’t the primary purpose of that company. But perhaps most importantly, they do not offer a temporary sandbox status to startups with more experimental models. It will take a while to fully understand the impact of all these new regulations. For now, the hope is that it won’t decelerate the innovative momentum that has built up over the past few years in one of the most important regions in the world’s most populous continent.

As reported by CoinDesk last week, two of China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges abruptly suspended bitcoin withdrawals in response to new pressures from the People's Bank of China, a move that was followed by similar, though less restrictive, policy updates from exchanges across the country. But while the price was not significantly impacted, traders are reporting that they have had to shift strategies, as they believe exchanges no longer act as a reliable price indicator. In conversation with CoinDesk, representatives from major OTC firms indicated that they are now largely using the US dollar price (as listed on British Virgin Islands-based Bitfinex) to determine the price of bitcoin. Zhou Shouji, operator of OTC trading firm FinTech Blockchain Group, for example, said his firm now uses the USD rate, as did OTC trader Zhao Dong, who went so far as to described China's exchanges as ""totally disabled"". ""Since you can't withdraw, the price is meaningless if you want to trade bitcoin,"" Zhao said, telling CoinDesk: Traders further indicated that activity is increasingly taking place on peer-to-peer (P2P) exchange platforms including Bitcoinworld and Bitpie, a wallet and P2P service set up by startup Bither. Those interviewed indicated that they believe such services could become more widely used, especially if further actions are announced by the central bank. Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager at OTC firm Richfund, described the prevailing sentiment as one of continued uncertainty. ""I'm just waiting to see what will happen next,"" he told CoinDesk. ""I don't think anyone can predict what the PBOC will impose next."" Shredded yuan image via Shutterstock

Yesterday, the court was set to begin jury selection for the trial of Yuri Lebedev – one of the co-operators of Coin.mx alongside Anthony Murgio, who plead guilty to three charges early last month – and Trevon Gross, a pastor who was accused of helping Coin.mx and its backers to take control of a New Jersey credit union in exchange for bribes. Gross was originally charged last March. Now, according to reports, Judge Alison Nathan has delayed jury selection by a day after the prosecution introduced a new witness, who was said to have information related to Gross’s activities. Judge Nathan ultimately opted not to allow the witness, punting jury selection to 14th February. Lebedev, along with Murgio, was initially arrested in mid-2015, accused of running an unlicensed money transmission business in Florida. While related court filings don’t explicitly draw the connection, prosecutors have tied Coin.mx’s actions to a broader cybercriminal scheme involving a series of high-profile hacks in the last several years. The most notable of these was a breach of Wall Street giant JPMorgan Chase, resulting in a data compromise for tens of millions of customer accounts. Prosecutors have also alleged that that Coin.mx functioned as a money conduit for the cybercrime scheme, using the New Jersey credit union – since shuttered by regulators – as a means to discreetly move funds. It’s not immediately clear when the trial itself will begin. Murgio is expected to face sentencing in June. Image via Shutterstock

In a press release today, Tokyo-based Bitflyer revealed it had raised new capital from financial firms including Sumitomo Mitsui, Mizuho Financial Group and Dai-ichi Life Insurance Company. A report by Japan-based news source Nikkei indicated that the funding equalled roughly ¥200m ($1.76m). According to statements from the startup, the fundraising follows BitFlyer's work with Sumitomo and Mizuho on private blockchain solutions aimed at providing the core infrastructure for enterprise use cases.  Notably, the funding also comes during what could be a period of increasing competition for the startup. As acknowledged in its release, legislation is slated to become law in June that would enable regulated firms to enter Japan's bitcoin and cryptocurrency markets.  As reported by CoinDesk, the move is expected by many in the blockchain industry to open the doors for existing financial firms to begin offering such services. Still, BitFlyer is expected to be competitive in the market, boasting more than $35m in funding, the most recent of which was a $27m Series C.

According to analysts, traders remain reluctant about placing bets in the market, as concerns linger about further actions from the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the nation's central bank. The digital currency has experienced significant volatility in the last several weeks, as the PBOC's decision to crack down on domestic exchanges has caused these marketplaces to announce a slew of sudden policy changes. Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC (previously called the 'Big Three' exchanges) all announced they would impose consistent fees, cut margin trading and halt or slow deposits and withdrawals denominated in digital currency in recent days. These continued developments have made some market participants reluctant to trade bitcoin, according to BTC VIX, community moderator for trading group Whale Club. He told CoinDesk: ""I wouldn't hold any position for more than a few hours because the PBOC will continue to be active and exchanges certainly have more announcements over the next 30 days,"" he said. So far, there's evidence backing this theory, as traders put in a large number sell orders around the $1,000 price point. This resistance was confirmed by both order book data and the input of market analysts. Exchanges Bitfinex and Kraken showed the number of sell orders exceeding the number of buy orders close to the $1,000 mark. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, weighed in on this development: Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, offered similar input. ""The $1,000 level is indeed a strong psychological resistance. Bitcoin will need to cleanly break above $1,000 (high-volume rise and sustained price action above 1000) to transform that level into price support,"" he continued. Still, he added that there are potential bullish catalysts, citing the March approval of a Bitcoin ETF or positive regulatory news from China as two possible boons.

                            Forex Giants Trading Bitcoin? In Japan That Might Be Months Away                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/forex-bitcoin-japan-blockchain-startups-months-away/," ""It's going to be a big game changer. It's made way for all these big institutions."" Makoto Takemiya doesn't have to go far to find someone who agrees that Japan's financial giants will soon start to push startups out of the country’s cryptocurrency market. In fact, the CEO of blockchain identity startup Soramitsu is sitting across from Mike Kayamori, the CEO of bitcoin exchange Quoine, who is already shifting his company from the consumer market for this reason. Go Takahashi, HAW International's director, and Hitoshi Kakizawa, head of blockchain at Deloitte's Japan subsidiary, Tohmatsu Venture Support, agree, asserting that when new legislation becomes law later this year, Japan's blockchain market will see a radical change. In spite of their varied business models and approaches to the technology, the four delegates, in New York as part of a government-sponsored innovation exchange program, find rare agreement on the issue. Takemiya, himself a member of the Hyperledger blockchain consortium, believes that ""big financial institutions"" are lining up to add a new asset class to their existing product offers. He told CoinDesk: Kayamori, whose exchange raised $16m in a funding round last year, doesn’t agree with the choice of words, but he's just as certain this transition will begin to take place in April. That's when a law passed in Japan last May – which will require exchanges to register with the country’s Financial Services Agency (FSA) – will go into force, and digital currencies will become regulated. When that happens, according to Kayamori, major foreign exchange (FX) players including GMO Internet, SBI Holdings, Monex and Hirose Financial will all seek to launch services that help boost customer activity via new product offerings. Some, like GMO and SBI, are already positioning publicly for the move. ""They're going to put bitcoin, ethereum and ripple, they just haven’t decided who they are going to outsource to, or who their liquidity partners will be,"" he said. Others at the table all agree that, despite the increasing focus on enterprise blockchain and distributed ledger applications, movement on cryptocurrency will be a beachhead in Japan. ""They want to get the new business,"" Kakizawa said. ""They want more currency."" Yet despite this agreement (and the common ground of being notable players in a small industry), the startups selected for the exchange program have varied approaches to blockchain tech. Kayamori, for instance, was there to meet exchanges including Paxos’s itBit and the Winklevoss-backed Gemini exchange, along with market makers and hedge funds. Yet others had newer business models. On the other end of the spectrum, Takahashi noted that HAW International (itself an 18-year-old IT services firm) is looking to conduct proofs-of-concept projects with financial institutions, encouraging them to explore how traditional assets could trade on public blockchains. ""These take three days of settlement, but on the blockchain this kind of program takes 10 minutes,"" he said. Interestingly, Takahashi favors the bitcoin blockchain for his work with institutions, praising its simple scripting language as an asset, even as interest migrates to platforms like ethereum. (A concept that was greeted with skepticism by other attendees, some meeting for the first time). By contrast, Tohmatsu, Kakizawa said, was there to observe and learn, so that it can keep tabs on the growing market as a value-add for its service offerings. The delegation itself is part of a 55-strong startup group, of which 13 were sent to New York. All are there to meet business contacts and better understand how their products might fit into the world market. Yet, while the changes ahead are expected to create new pressures, all agreed that they will improve Japan’s cryptocurrency market. Kakizawa, for instance, excitedly draws his cellphone at one point to show how his news feed has been bombarded with 'sagicoin'-related content – that's Japanese slang for ‘shitcoins’, or cryptocurrencies that don’t have a unique or valuable market proposition. Takemiya agrees with the sentiment, throwing in a personal example of why he believes the local market needs to be reined in order to protect consumers. ""Near my house there’s a shared cafe where we can go and work, and a person next to me was trying to sell this old women on something called 'securecoin'. And he’s talking about how the Japanese yen is doomed and has all this government debt,"" he said. ""Which makes sense,"" Kayamori added in jest, though he said the enterprise market isn’t likely to be the Wild West consumers see currently. ""That’s going to change, after these financial companies come in,"" he continued. Yet, there are signs this transition may be plagued by familiar roadblocks. Toward the end of the meeting, Kayamori encourages Takemiya to apply his blockchain-based know-your-customer platform to the market, but he's not sure it’s the right move. ""We don’t want to be so associated with cryptocurrency,"" Takemiya said. Kayamori isn’t easily swayed, concluding: Image by Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk

                            Are Bitcoin Traders Planning for an ETF Approval?                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-planning-etf-approval/," Traders seem to be already pricing in the US Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) upcoming ruling on the Winklevoss bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), according to most analysts polled by CoinDesk. Should the fund – sought by Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss – receive approval, the creation of an easily accessible investment vehicle could trigger a massive influx of capital and robust price increases, market observers have stated. As a result, the SEC decision, which has a deadline of 11th March, has drawn significant attention from traders. Several analysts spoke with CoinDesk about how an SEC decision to approve a bitcoin ETF could have a significant impact on the market for the digital currency. ""If the Winklevoss ETF, or any other bitcoin ETF for that matter, is approved by the SEC, bitcoin prices are almost certainly likely to jump in the following months and years,"" said Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. He pointed to the sharp gains that gold and silver prices enjoyed after ETFs backed by these commodities hit the market. ""A bitcoin ETF could also open the door"" to retirement accounts and pension funds, which represent a market worth trillions. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, also offered some bullish commentary, stating that SEC approval would likely motivate foreign regulators to approve similar listings in their jurisdictions. He added that this could have a huge effect on the digital currency, saying: Jacob Eliosoff, an algorithmic trader, weighed in on how approving the SEC could spur both significant investor interest and higher prices. ""I'd expect approval of the ETF to trigger a deluge of mainstream and institutional investor money pouring in. So, even if the chance of approval is small, it's a small chance of a big gain, which could certainly be pushing up the price."" While several market observers have emphasized how much of a difference approving a bitcoin ETF would make, traders have offered a wide range of views on what the SEC may decide. Many are optimistic that the Winklevoss fund will receive approval, according to Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy. ""Most traders are bullish that something will get done,"" he told CoinDesk. Bobby Lee, CEO of Chinese exchange BTCC, provided a similar assessment, stating: However, not everyone is so certain. Zivkovski described the markets as cautiously optimistic about the fund's chances of receiving approval, pointing to market dynamics to support his point of view. He recently told CoinDesk that most of the orders coming in to his platform are long, and Whaleclub data shows that in the seven days through 10th February, speculative wagers were 84% long. 'Confidence', which measures the extent by which a particular session's position sizes were larger than average, averaged 83% during this period. While these figures seemingly point to bullish sentiment, some analysts have painted a less optimistic picture of the situation, forecasting that the fund has low chances of obtaining approval. Kevin Zhou, a cryptocurrency trader for exchange Kraken, estimated that the markets are giving the ETF a 10% chance of receiving authorization from the SEC – a figure with which he agrees. Spencer Bogart, an analyst for Needham & Company, has also provided a less-than-optimistic forecast. ""In contrast to most of the people that we speak to in the industry, we think the probability that a bitcoin ETF will be approved in 2017 is very low – it's difficult to quantify but we think the probability is sub-25%."" The Winklevoss ETF might still run into some hurdles that could prevent its approval. The SEC has already provided the Winklevoss twins with many potential risks they must consider, including whether the fund could be the victim of a hack or whether the bitcoin network could split into more than one faction, as happened with ethereum. The Winklevoss twins originally filed for the ETF in July 2013, so the fund has been awaiting approval for more than three years. Even after this time, unanswered questions still remain, said Zivkovski. For example, he asked how a bitcoin ETF would fulfill demand on the notoriously illiquid bitcoin markets. And would the Winklevoss fund provide insurance in the event of a hack? There are also concerns that approving a bitcoin ETF could intensify volatility, according to Hayes. The ""copycat effect"" – where foreign regulators follow the SEC’s lead – could end up being one of the reasons the government agency refuses to give the fund the nod. Hayes pointed to the sharp price fluctuations bitcoin has experienced over the last several weeks, as the digital currency surged to more than $1,150 and then fell below $750. ""No doubt the SEC has been watching,"" he said. In addition, the government agency might reject the proposed fund simply to cover its back, according to Bogart. Pointing to the SEC's generally conservative nature, he asserted that, if the organization's staff approve the ETF, they have little to gain and much to lose. Bogart suggested that if the fund does well, the staff who approved it will likely not receive any recognition, but if it does poorly, they could face serious consequences. In spite of the ETF's aforementioned obstacles, the current situation is on the whole a good one for bitcoin prices, said Hayes. While Bogart has given the Winklevoss fund low odds of approval, a refusal would cause only a ""slight drop"" in price. he said. Past that, he described the approval of a bitcoin ETF as inevitable, saying: Because of these factors, Bogart described the risk-reward ratio for this event as positive. Willy Woo, a derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast, painted a similar picture, emphasizing that while a 'no' from the SEC would produce a minor correction in price, a 'yes' would produce sharp gains.

                            Whatâs in a Name? From Bitcoin to Blockchain to Distributed Ledgers                        ",Nelson M Rosario,https://www.coindesk.com/whats-in-a-name-from-bitcoin-to-blockchain-to-distributed-ledgers/,"Nelson M Rosario is an intellectual property attorney working as an associate at Marshall, Gerstein & Borun in Chicago. He has years of experience working on patent prosecution matters in bitcoin/blockchain and fintech, as well as other areas. In this CoinDesk opinion piece, RosarioÂ ponders why we have developed so many terms for what is effectively the same technology â bitcoin.  âWhatâs in a name? That which we call an electronic payment system based on cryptographic proof instead of trust by any other name would smell as sweet.â âÂ William 'Satoshi' Shakespeare (probably) In the beginning, there was 'bitcoin', and it was good. But, bitcoin would end up bearing a nomenclature fruit salad that tests mortal comprehension. Perhaps, that is the natural way of things. As a new technology develops, the number of people exposed to that new technology increases, and the language used to describe the new technology evolves. Initially, the language was limited to bitcoin. Now a person is liable to see any of the following words or phrases that theoretically all mean different things: bitcoin, Bitcoin, block chain, blockchain, Blockchain, private blockchain, public blockchain, distributed ledger technology, distributed asset ledgers, decentralized ledger technology, shared ledgers, et al. Further confusing the matter, the term bitcoin may not always mean the same thing to different people. What happened? Why the change in language? First, bitcoin has the word 'coin' right in it. This naturally makes people think of currency. Not surprisingly, bitcoin use as a currency is far and away the most successful iteration of bitcoin. The applications for bitcoin are not, however, limited to currency. This is where much of the confusion arises. Intuitively, the currency implementation for bitcoin (with the word coin in it) makes sense. Trying to convince someone that bitcoin can also be used for purposes as diverse as asset transfers, escrow services, or logistics management is not so straightforward. Bitcoin also suffers from an image problem. The early publicity surrounding bitcoin included scandals, thefts, a euphoria akin to the Tulip bubble, and in general, bad press. 'Fake internet money',Â as some people called bitcoin, did not inspire confidence amongst the masses. Additionally, the main advocates for the new technology were unpolished and unproven. Often if someone had heard of bitcoin they had heard of the failed Mt Gox exchange, or they assumed bitcoin was something a person used to buy illicit drugs or hire a hitman. The reality was not that far off. How do you get people to forget about the failed exchanges, drugs, and hitmen? Get them to focus on 'the technology underlying bitcoin', and get them to think about the other potential implementations. Once the conversation moved beyond currency, people started searching for a new word. That search led them to the blockchain. Negative publicity and conceptual confusion laid the groundwork for people to begin to refer to the blockchain as the real innovation to come out of the bitcoin phenomenon. The blockchain is a chain of transactions that makes bitcoin possible. The term refers to a collection of bitcoin transactions grouped together into blocks and linked through cryptography. This linkage is part of what makes it virtually impossible to fake bitcoin transactions. In a sense, the blockchain provides true decentralized trust and distributed consensus, but the rebranding, or reorienting of peopleâs attention, to the blockchain and away from bitcoin may be just a clever marketing trick. Many people argue that you cannot separate the blockchain from bitcoin. The thinking is that you cannot break up bitcoin into its component parts because the parts by themselves will not work the same way independent of each other. In other words, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Regardless of whether this is correct, that is precisely what people have done. Once the power of bitcoin became apparent, we started to see article after article touting the 'real innovation' behind bitcoin. Respectable and well-established firms began developing blockchain solutions to their problems. People consistently discredited bitcoin as boring, while extolling the virtues of the multifaceted blockchain. Large banks, financial exchanges, and the 'Big Four' consultancies all rushed to publish reports on blockchain technology. The hype train that left the station heading to Bitcoinland was diverted to Blockchainville. There are now hundreds of blockchain startups. Problems related to back end services for large institutions, digital identity, asset transfer, escrow, and logistics, are all being tackled by blockchain solutions. Even tracking pork along a blockchain has been proposed. These companies are doing truly innovative work. However, to many observers the term 'blockchain' is still conceptually associated with bitcoin. So, if a company describes an innovation that leverages a type of blockchain they have to distinguish it from bitcoin and the bitcoin blockchain. How do blockchain companies talk about what they are doing without referencing bitcoin, or other blockchains? The solution is to talk about ledgers. A ledger can record transactions between multiple parties. The ledger concept is a main building block of bitcoin and any blockchain. Ledgers also benefit from the fact that they are commonly thought of as boring, safe, and dependable tools in an accountantâs toolbox, as opposed to the technological innovation that makes bitcoin possible. What better way to put thoughts of bitcoin and blockchain out of peopleâs minds than insisting that you are only talking about ledger technology? Thus, the conceptual chain to bitcoin was broken. However, there remains considerable debate over whether this is feasible or even desirable. To early adopters, bitcoin is a monolith that cannot exist without distributed trust, consensus, and immutability, but many new industry entrants view the technology as an a la carte buffet. They are free to decide between many concepts including: permissioned vs permissionless, public vs private, tokenized vs no token, etc. Today any institution or organization that refers to ledgers is free to discuss bitcoin or blockchain related concepts, without the supposed taint of bitcoin. Even the Federal Reserve Board (of Federal Reserve Bank fame), has touted ledgers in their recent report on âDistributed Ledger Technology.â Over the past two years, hundreds of new blockchains and ledgers have been created. They all draw on the root concepts of bitcoin, but their purposes and the lingo used to describe them have diverged widely. This conceptual repackaging, and public relations approved language replacement, is likely to continue for some time. This story has gone from bitcoin to blockchain to distributed ledger technology. There are companies that operate in all of these spaces, or only one of them. Outside observers are forgiven if they struggle to keep up with all the different terms. Yet, through all of this evolution and upheaval, bitcoin has remained central to the discussion. Whether bitcoin, the blockchain, and distributed ledgers will be adopted and thrive or consigned to the ash heap of history remains to be seen. The fact that bitcoin has undergone repeated repackaging is a testament to the strength of the technology. Other blockchains or related technologies may rise and fall, but bitcoinâs inertia and first-mover advantage will continue to make it the most relevant cryptocurrency, blockchain, and ledger.

                            Charts: How an ETF Approval Could Impact Bitcoin's Price                        ",Willy Woo,https://www.coindesk.com/charts-etf-approval-impact-bitcoins-price/,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast. In this guest feature, Woo explores how the bitcoin market might react if a long-awaited ETF was approved and millions in new capital were injected into the market overnight.  This infographic of bitcoin's price is something I've been pondering today. It tells bitcoin's often dramatic price story in fundamental trend lines that abstract away some serious doses of speculative activity. There's a lot in this chart, so lets break it down: If this story is fundamentally correct, the picture it paints is quite useful.  Using this data, we can deduce the impact of a controlled reduction in bitcoin supply on price, and because of this, we can use it to extrapolate changes as a result of new capital inflow. The diagram above traces two price trajectories, and they etch out the price impact of two monetary dilution policies. Every 10 minutes, blue supplies 12.5 BTC onto the markets, while green supplies 25 BTC. The difference between the two trend lines at any point in time will give you the price impact from their differences in supply. The difference between the two trend lines at any point in time will give you the “fair value” price impact from their differences in supply. I say “fair value” as in reality bubble mania would take hold and we’d see a party session above the new baseline and probably another very long three cats and a moon consolidation. First, a note about the accuracy of this method. As any chartist and trader can attest, placement of the trend lines is an art, so bear in mind the actual results are subject to significant errors. Nevertheless, let's see if the results make any sense…   * The short-term price would be driven by speculators, as an actual ETF fund would source the majority of bitcoins from over-the-counter markets. This means it would take some time before the impacts of reduced supply reached the bitcoin exchange markets. ** At 25% chance price should calculate as $900+$190*4 whereas at 33% probability the calculation would be $900+$190*3 Needham and Company At 25% chance and a speculative pricing of $1100 pre-decision, my model would predict $1bn of longer-term capital injection and a fundamental valuation target of $1700. This is within ballpark. Seeking Alpha If probability adjusted price is in fact $1,645, my model would predict a fair value price target of $3,125 (and $2.2bn of ETF capital). Given their target likely accounts for speculative overshoots that always plague price mania, the two are moderately in agreement. In this case the speculative overshoot would need to be 18%. Seeking Alpha comment the markets are undervaluing bitcoin by a wild margin (67% at the time of the report). This piece is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, investment advice.

                            A Bitcoin Hard Fork? The Science of Contentious Code is Advancing                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-hard-fork-exploring-science-contentious-code-change/,"Bitcoin developers are probing deeper into how best to execute a so-called hard fork, a contentious upgrading tool that's been at the heart of the nearly $16bn network's most divisive debate for years now. The issue is that to be used cleanly and without unintentional consequences, a hard fork requires all the digital currency's miners to move to a new blockchain, or version of its transaction history. One case study of what can otherwise happen came last summer, when ethereum inadvertently split into two networks after executing a hard fork some users disagreed with. That's not to say that all hard forks have the same outcome. Interestingly, the following two ethereum hard forks went according to plan, as they were non-contentious changes to fix attacks on the network, perhaps demonstrating that they can go well if all participants agree. Meanwhile, against this backdrop, some in the bitcoin community have long been calling for a hard fork to increase transaction capacity by raising the blocksize parameter to 2MB or more, with Bitcoin Unlimited being the latest software to take up the call for action. One impediment is that, since increasing the block size is a contentious change, a similar ethereum-like split could occur in bitcoin if a hard fork were executed. For that reason and others, the engineering consensus seems to be that more research needs to be done before giving it a try in bitcoin. BitmainWarranty's James Hilliard, who has tested code for Bitcoin Core, said that, though he's generally “conservative” on the issue of a hard fork (as are the most active contributors), there might be a potential need for one in the future, especially since it's the only way to make certain types of changes. Hilliard told CoinDesk: Of late, there's been an uptake in research in this direction, with some bitcoin code contributors continuing long-standing studies into how a hard fork might be used. Lengthy analysis has been posted to the bitcoin developer mailing list over the last couple of months, and there's now even an open-source website filled with links to notable public hard fork research. Bitcoin developers appear to be approaching the option carefully, looking into a range of considerations, such as how to safely execute such a change. Along those lines, a batch of new hard fork proposals have been released in the last few months. None have received much support in terms of near-term execution, but they have generated discussion and show an uptake in attention. Perhaps most notably, Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau, who has been perhaps the most prolific in terms of posting hard fork write-ups to the mailing list, just this week coded up a second experimental hard fork, called 'Spoonnet', with new features that bitcoin currently doesn't have. He hinted that trying to activate it right now, without unanimous consensus, would not lead to positive results. ""Trying to activate it on testnet will get you banned. Trying to activate it on mainnet before consensus is reached will make you lose money,"" he wrote. Despite the long write-up and code accompanying it, he mentioned that there are plenty of details to iron out before Spoonnet is ready to use, such as ensuring that wallets in the post-hard fork world would support transactions on the new network. Lau’s other hard fork proposal, called Forcenet, codes up a type of hard fork known as a 'soft-hard fork', that makes old nodes follow the new rules, based on an earlier proposal by Bitcoin Core contributor Luke Dashjr. It puts into practice a new block header format that adds room for more data, among other things. Then, there are some hard fork proposals that relate more specifically to the block size debate. Dashjr posted two hard fork proposals last month, one of which proposes an initial optional decrease to the block size that would switch to a steady increase to 31 MB. Hilliard pointed out that hard fork research pertaining to the block size in particular has been going on for a while. He drew up with his own hard fork proposal last February, though perhaps owing to the speed of R&D, he said he wouldn’t vouch for it because it’s ""overly complicated"". Notably, few of the newer proposals are related to making hard forks safer. For instance, addressing the issue that stakeholders could lose money (or see the value of their investment decline) if the blockchain splits. One such proposal is for a 'hard fork warning system', with which wallets and miners can warn others in the case of a hard fork. ""With a hard fork warning system, users and merchants may stop trading when there is abnormality on the network until they are able to make an informed decision,"" Lau explained, mentioning that this might have been useful in former unintentional bitcoin splits, as well as that of ethereum. Further, replay attacks featured heavily in the aftermath of ethereum’s fork and resulting blockchain split. In a nutshell, because the transaction histories were the same on each resulting network, users could send transactions on both networks, which caused confusion – at least up until the issue was fixed. Proposals from Dashjr and Lau grapple with this issue using different techniques. Interestingly, even the details of this protective action were cause for disagreement, with Bitcoin Core contributor Matt Corallo arguing in response to Lau’s bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) that replay attack protection should be mandatory rather than opt-in. Hilliard noted that another safety measure would be to have a ""reasonably long"" activation timeline of a year or so. As far as for what reason to carry out a hard fork, the block size debate continues to be the elephant in the room. In Hilliard’s opinion, the block size is not a good enough reason to hard fork, at least right now, where the split in opinion could manifest in two networks, and increasing the block size could increase the burden of running a volunteer node. He added: Still, figuring out a way to carry out hard forks safely might be beneficial, as there’s no other way to make certain technical changes to bitcoin. ""Fixing tech issues would be a good reason, in my opinion,"" Hilliard said. He pointed to a long list of bug fixes and other potential changes on the so-called 'hard-fork wish list', including header format changes that would ""make it so that miners mining on pools can't withhold blocks"". One other such change could bundle in what Lau called a ""secondary block header"", which could store new data that, for one, could potentially boost the security of SPV nodes (which store less data than regular nodes). ""None of the core devs are really against hard forks, they are just conservative,"" Hilliard said. Lau similarly indicated that it could happen as long as most one day agree with a change. ""When the vast majority of bitcoin users believe the system is too inefficient (in many aspects, not just transaction throughput) and they believe the benefits outweigh the risks, a hard fork will happen,"" he said. Hilliard, though, doesn't seem to be in a hurry, noting that it might take a while to find a solution that everyone agrees with. He concluded: Research image via Shutterstock

                            More Chinese Exchanges Impose Bitcoin Withdrawal Delays                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/chinese-exchanges-will-delay-bitcoin-withdrawals/,"Following the lead of two of the market's more prominent exchanges, at least six other China-based bitcoin exchanges have announced updates to withdrawal policies as part of a bid to tighten AML oversight. Announced today, BitBays, BTC100, BTCTrade, CHBTC, HaoBTC and Yunbi have all enacted changes to their withdrawal capabilities, a move that comes days after the exchanges were called to meet with the Beijing office of the People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank.  Notably, the policies issued differ from the more stringent halt of bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals imposed by Huobi and OKCoin, which will stop these services for one month. Only CHBTC indicated it would suspend bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals for this duration. In statements issued by BTCTrade, BTC100 and HaoBTC, the exchanges said that bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals would now be delayed, though they did not indicate they would halt any services.  All indicated yuan deposits and withdrawals would be unaffected, and that anti-money laundering (AML) upgrades were the impetus for the decision. HaoBTC noted that its new policy was implemented to restrict the ability of its wallet users to deposit yuan, buy bitcoin and then send the digital currency within 48 hours. It also said it would now charge a 5% fee on all deposits.  Others gave more clarity, as BitBays estimated its withdrawals would now take one hour and 10 minutes. ""We are very sorry about that,"" the exchange said. Of all the firms, Yunbi, one of the region's more prominent exchanges for the alternative digital asset ether, perhaps provided the most straightforward explanation of how the new process would work, indicating it would report suspicious activity to regulators.

                            Bitcoin, Blockchain and Trump: Where Do We Go From Here?                        ",David Brill,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-blockchain-trump-go/,"Former counsel to bitcoin exchange Gemini, David Brill, is a fintech lawyer with more than 20 years of experience.  In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Brill shares his insights from the American Bar Association (ABA) Conference on Derivatives and Futures Law, at which he spoke in January.   The regulatory environment for blockchain and bitcoin (as well as the overall securities environment) is in flux as US President Donald Trump's administration begins to gather momentum. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) have already been working for several years on various digital currency-related policies, and now it appears the organizations' to-do lists are about to grow. Trump has an ambitious agenda when it comes to financial regulations, including repealing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act and Volcker Rule, while implementing the Federal CHOICE Act. But the regulatory bodies will likely need to figure out ways to implement a wide variety of changes, with a static or smaller budget than previous years. Recently, I spoke at The American Bar Association Business Law Section, Derivatives and Futures Conference where the impact of Trump was top of many of the attendees' minds. Hosted in Naples, Florida, by the ABA, the goal of the conference was to have an open dialogue between business lawyers in private practice, senior in-house counsel and various federal agencies. Attendees of the event included the acting chairman of the CFTC, J Christopher Giancarlo (via teleconference), who has embraced Trump’s 'Make America Great Again' slogan as part of his own agency agenda. Also there were a number of lawyers from the SEC, the National Futures Association and representatives from large law firms and investment banks. Fresh off the inauguration of President Trump, the sentiment of the attendees generally speaking was hopeful that the new administration would be favorable to the business community. Pointing to a number of statements made by President Trump, there was optimism that some of the more burdensome financial laws passed in the prior administration would be scaled back or repealed, enabling banks to more efficiently conduct their operations. However, over the course of the event, it also became very clear to me that funding constraints will potentially play a major role in what regulation we will see in the blockchain and bitcoin space. Given President Trump's ambitious agenda (which includes rolling back major pieces of Dodd-Frank, eliminating two regulations for every new regulation enacted and keeping a potentially static budget for the SEC and the CFTC), the agencies seemingly will need to be judicious in how they use their resources. What does this mean for blockchain and bitcoin? Since the CFTC is currently working with only three of five commissioners, and acting chairman Christopher Giancarlo is awaiting confirmation, it will take time to assess and implement any changes. Giancarlo has a background in markets, and has publicly embraced a more collaborative approach to blockchain. He has spoken about his willingness to leverage technology and supports having ""savvy teams"" work with fintech companies. With resources at a premium, the CFTC may need to employ a cost benefit analysis on any additional regulation. With this pragmatic view in mind, it seems likely in the short term that the CFTC won't have the bandwidth to focus much on blockchain and bitcoin. In this scenario, I see blockchain being supported by the CFTC in various forms, including dedicated support, collaboration and perhaps the creation of a regulatory sandbox, akin to what is in place in the UK. For bitcoin, any scarce resources will likely be for enforcement actions and to ensure certain types of impermissible options and futures trading are prevented. The populist movement that led to the 'Brexit' and President Trump will also have an effect on how blockchain is regulated overseas. The result could be a realignment of regulatory strategy in other regions. In Europe, amid the uncertainty over the exit of the UK from the EU, fintech companies, including those focused on blockchain and bitcoin, will have to recalibrate their approach to doing business in Europe. A number of companies that were planing to passport their business into the EU through Luxembourg or other fintech-friendly jurisdictions will also now need to work directly with the UK. The UK, with its fintech-friendly regulatory sandbox, and Ireland, seem to have the most to gain in this regulatory realignment. We may see a number of blockchain companies move their headquarters or significant operations to London and pursue opening offices in Ireland as a passport into the EU. Major changes in the political landscape are likely to affect how blockchain and bitcoin companies do business going forward. In the US, we have witnessed a number of cross-currents on what financial regulation will look like going forward. With President Trump’s ambitious agenda and focus on deregulation and federal hiring freezes, will the regulatory environment keep up with rapid changes to blockchain and bitcoin? Will we see companies apply for and receive fintech charters? Is a regulatory sandbox for blockchain companies in the US on the horizon? Will a bitcoin ETF be approved? Only time will tell – but 2017 is shaping up to be a very interesting year. Donald Trump image via Shutterstock

                            China Fears Spread Beyond Bitcoin As Crypto Markets Slide                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/china-fears-spread-beyond-bitcoin-crypto-markets-slide/," The digital currency markets experienced widespread price declines today, as concerns surrounding the latest developments in China motivated many traders to sell off not only bitcoin, but alternative digital assets. The development follows the PBoC's announcement today that it warned several domestic exchange operators that they must comply with regulations or risk being shut down. Traders also received startling news from major operations Huobi and OKCoin that, effective immediately, they would suspend bitcoin withdrawals for one month. Markets reacted strongly to these developments, with bitcoin prices falling to as little as $942 at 14:30 UTC, a more than 10% decline from the opening price, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The digital currency then recovered, rising to $975.21 at the time of report. Yet, even after this increase, bitcoin prices were still roughly 7.5% lower for the session, BPI figures show. Even in alternative digital asset markets, the impact of the development in bitcoin was widely felt. Ether, which powers the smart contract-based platform ethereum and is the second-largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, fell to as little as $10.67 on CoinMarketCap, down close to 7% since the start of the day. The digital token then recovered lost ground, reaching $10.92 at the time of report. Yet, even after making these gains, ether was roughly 4.8% lower for the session at time of writing.  Ether classic, which was created roughly six months ago as a result of an ethereum hard fork, provided the most striking example of a price decline, dropping upwards of 20% for the day to $1.20 on CoinMarketCap, after trading at $1.47 at 12:04 UTC. The digital currency, which helps power the smart contract-based platform ethereum classic, later rose to $1.28 at the time of report. At this price, ether was roughly 12% lower for the day.
 Monero, a digital currency that leverages ring signatures to help provide market participants with a high level of privacy, fell to as little as $11.83 during the day, close to 8% below the price of $12.83 at 12:04 UTC, according to CoinMarketCap. At the time of report, the digital currency had recovered slightly, trading at $11.91, still more than 7% lower for the session.  The fact that digital currency prices suffered widespread declines today, and then proceeded to recover, is merely part of a broader trend, Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk. He emphasized that in some cases, news that bodes poorly for bitcoin ""may actually help (or at least be neutral for) other major coins."" He pointed to a bug in bitcoin's blockchain or a major disagreement between bitcoin developers as potential examples. However, news that causes bitcoin prices to push lower usually has the same effect on the price of altcoins, he said. The high correlation that exists between the price of digital currencies may simply be a sign of the market’s immaturity. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency to scale, and has grabbed the lion's share of the total market capitalization owned by these digital assets. (In most cases, you have to buy bitcoin before purchasing other altcoins). However, several altcoins have risen to prominence by offering some compelling value not provided by bitcoin. Ethereum, whose currency ether had a market capitalization of roughly $970m at the time of report, has drawn interest by offering developers a platform where they can create applications that rely on smart contracts. Likewise, Monero, the fifth-largest digital currency by market capitalization according to CoinMarketCap, has carved out its own niche by offering a level of privacy far higher than that of bitcoin. In this way, Eliosoff and others are hoping that the ""extreme correlation"" that exists between the prices of digital currencies today will diminish over time as more establish singular use cases and establish unique infrastructure. As evidenced by today's moves, however, this development remains in the distance. Dominoes image via Shutterstock

According to court documents filed on 1st February and unsealed yesterday, Jeffrey Wertkin sought to sell a criminal complaint related to a whistleblower case for $310,000, asking that he be paid in bitcoin for the offer. Wertkin, who was arrested on 31st January, was previously a partner for Akin Gump Strauss Hauer & Feld, a major Washington, DC-based law practice and lobbying firm. According to OpenSecrets.org, the firm's clients include AT&T, Volkswagen and Mobil Oil, among others. Wertkin also served six years as a trial lawyer for the US Justice Department, The New York Times reported yesterday. Court documents show that Wertkin reached out to an unnamed employee of a California cybersecurity firm, ultimately moving to sell that individual sealed information related to a complaint that had been filed against the company. Using the moniker ""Dan"", Wertkin sent a partial copy of the complaint to the company, offering a full copy in exchange for $310,000 in bitcoin. The filing states: Wertkin and the employee, after a series of additional conversations, were scheduled to meet at the Hilton Garden Inn in Cupertino, California. FBI agent William Scanlon, who submitted the affidavit, was waiting nearby in the place of the tech company employee. Once the copy of the complaint was handed to Scanlon, other FBI agents quickly moved in to arrest Wertkin, who, according to the affidavit, ""was wearing a wig which I believed was to conceal his identity"". ""My life is over,"" Wertkin reportedly said as he was arrested. A full copy of the FBI affidavit can be found below: FBI Affidavit by CoinDesk on Scribd  Image via Shutterstock

The years-long effort – delayed more than once by the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) – is aimed at providing a means for investors to gain exposure to bitcoin without actually having to buy the digital currency. The SEC is expected to make a decision on the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF later this year, with its self-imposed deadline of 11th March inching closer. Speculation around the approval is such that at least one exchange has moved to offer a prediction market, letting traders bet on the possible outcome. Documents submitted to the SEC on 8th February show that the planned offering has changed somewhat in scope. For example, the size of the offering has increased, from $65m to $100m, as well as a boost in the number of shares being offered, from 1m shares to 10m shares. The filing goes on to indicate that the maximum offering price per share has been lowered, from $65 down to just $10. Notably, the filing also features new language about the prospect of a network split following a software hard fork, or a backwards-incompatible change to bitcoin’s underlying code. In that circumstance, the filing states, the ETF’s custodian will support the blockchain that has “the greatest cumulative computational difficulty for the forty-eight (48) hour period following a given hard fork”. During that 48-hour period, the creation or redemption of new ETF baskets will be suspended. The filing goes on to state: The new filing also includes other minor updates such as the companies that will act as authorized participants. These firms are Convergex Execution Solutions LLC, KCG Americas LLC and Virtu Financial BD LLC. Image Credit: Sky Cinema / Shutterstock.com

Following in the footsteps of China's 'Big Three' exchanges, smaller competitors BTC Trade, BTC100, CHBTC, Dahonghuo, Yuanbao and BitBays all moved to impose or increase trading fees yesterday in the wake of a meeting with the People's Bank of China, China's central bank. Both BTC Trade and CHBTC said that the fees would come into force on 13th February, whereas the other exchanges did not identify a starting date. Further, with the exception of BTC 100 and BitBays, the exchanges all moved to add 0.2% maker and taker fees.  BitBays is now charging 0.1% maker fees and 0.15% taker fees, while BTC 100 announced that it would begin collecting trading fees, without adding details. Yunbi, in turn, announced a reduction in trading fees two days ago, dropping its trading fees from 0.2% to 0.05%. It was not immediately clear at press time whether Jubi – another of the exchanges to meet with the PBoC – had made a similar move. The developments come on the heels of a new warning from the PBoC to domestic bitcoin exchanges about the need for tighter anti-money laundering and foreign exchange controls. Two of China's ""Big Three"" exchanges – Huobi and OKCoin – went on to freeze bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals, stating that the new policy would last for one month. Fee policy changes at Huobi, OKCoin and BTCC had previously driven volume to no-fee exchanges – a trend that is now unlikely given the updates across the sector. Notably, Yuanbao and BitBays explicitly referenced regulatory concerns in their messages. By contrast, BTC Trade said it had moved to add fees ""in order to curb speculation [and] to prevent price speculation"", a message echoed in CHBTC's post. Bitcoin prices have fallen sharply since today’s news out of China first broke, averaging $957 at press time. Image via Shutterstock

Yuan deposits and withdrawals are not affected, the exchanges said. Markets had been hovering around $1,063 when the news broke, though this has now changed as the market seeks to price in the news. According to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), prices fell as much as $80, hitting a low of $958.56. BPI data shows that prices had previously hit a high of $1,077.76 earlier today. At press time, bitcoin prices are at an average of $988. CNY-denominated markets were down more than 13% from their peak on the news at one point, according to the BPI, falling from a high of ¥7,598.92 to an average of ¥6,755.52. However, the price was up 5% on the day at press time, indicating traders were perhaps viewing the news as a buying opportunity. So far, market observers appear to be reacting with a mixture of surprise and concern when reached for comment.

                            Two of China's Biggest Exchanges Stop Bitcoin Withdrawals                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/two-chinas-biggest-exchanges-stop-bitcoin-withdrawals/,"UPDATE (9th February 16:22 BST): This article has been updated with new information regarding BTCC’s bitcoin and litecoin withdrawal policy. Two of China's most widely used bitcoin exchanges have announced that they will suspend bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals for one month effective immediately. Yuan recharge, withdrawals and other services will not be affected, the exchanges said. In public posts that showcase the increasingly coordinated nature of exchange policy in the region, both OKCoin and Huobi said today that the move was a bid to bolster their anti-money laundering (AML) capabilities and prevent ""illegal transactions"". In the case of OKCoin, only it's OKCoin.cn portal is affected. Both OKCoin and Huobi indicated that their platforms would now go through an “upgrade” to combat “money laundering, exchange, pyramid schemes and other illegal activities”, though no further details were provided. Following the publication of this article, BTCC announced that it would also upgrade its internal systems. In the meantime, the exchange said, bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals will take 72 hours to process. All told, the move comes amid a rocky period for local exchanges that began with the wider scrutiny of major bitcoin exchanges by the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank. Earlier today, China's central bank issued a warning to domestic exchanges, going so far as to state it would move to shutter startups that violated its guidance through the necessary government channels. In statements provided to CoinDesk, Huobi indicated that the move was a proactive one that found the two exchanges seeking to ""promote bitcoin industry self-discipline"". Update: This article has been updated to clarify that only OKCoin's OKCoin.cn platform is affected by the withdrawal freeze.  Image via Shutterstock

                            LinkedIn Killer? Bitcoin Upstart 21 Takes on Social With Email Play                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/linkedin-killer-bitcoin-upstart-21-takes-on-social-giant-with-paid-email-play/," Cryptic bitcoin company 21 Inc has launched a paid email platform that seems far removed from its initial focus on hardware. The move is yet another in a string of pivots by the firm. Since it revealed it had raised $116m in 2015 (accrued over multiple rounds), 21 has evolved its strategy several times. Originally founded as a bitcoin mining company, it soon appointed a new CEO – Andreessen Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan – and announced plans to distribute bitcoin mining chips embedded in consumer and enterprise hardware devices. The chips, attached to a Raspberry Pi and called '21 Bitcoin Computers', started shipping in November 2015 and quickly developers began building applications for the device. Then, in March 2016, the company launched its first proof-of-concept for a network of devices incentivized to monitor websites with bitcoin. Several months later, it launched a software package that allowed any connected device to join the 21 network, enabling capabilities that were once only available to those with a 21 Bitcoin Computer. The new communications platform seems to be yet another evolution for 21 Inc, though Srinivasan said the company has been working on this idea for some time, pointing to an SMS version of the current product that was published in late 2015. Further, the CEO said, the email platform still aligns with the company’s primary goal. He told CoinDesk: In the old SMS version, 21 Inc showed users how to set up a 21 Bitcoin Computer to allow them to receive paid text messages from anyone without revealing the recipient’s number. The new platform, which allows users to set their own rate, makes the service accessible for people even without the company’s hardware. The new service – available via the website and a MacOS app – looks similar to LinkedIn's InMail (which Srinivasan said is the platform’s closest competitor). And some enthusiasts, including Craig Lauer, an angel investor and mentor to TechStars and EvoNexus, have even made it public that they'd rather use 21’s platform over LinkedIn. That’s probably because, according to Srinivasan, the recipient gets paid instead of the social network giant. On LinkedIn, payments made to send email to people outside your network are taken by LinkedIn itself, but on 21's platform, the money goes straight to the recipient. Most of it, anyway. When a user sends an email, 21 adds a 10% fee to transactions – for instance, sending an email to someone charging $1 means paying $1.10 total. That small fee, though, has the potential to turn into big revenue for 21. ""InMail is nevertheless estimated to be a $300m per year business for LinkedIn, and we think that market could expand if recipients can get paid,"" Srinivasan said. This is especially true if well-known early adopters keep setting high prices (and people are prepared to pay for access to them). Andreessen Horowitz's Ben Horowitz set his account at $100 via the service. With such high values, some wonder what the benefit of using bitcoin would be since, in these cases, it might be just as easy to add debit and credit payment options. But Srinivasan contends there are several advantages. ""It allows instant receipt of funds without linking a bank account, it works across borders and it can scale up and down to very small and large payments alike,"" he said. This appreciation is also, it seems, why people have rushed to the new service, since users can make $2 in bitcoin just by reading through how the site works and setting up an account. This mechanism for offering monetary value for tasks is the real mission of the 21 platform, according to Srinivasan. ""The goal is to make it possible to send targeted tasks to people. In the same way that your resume qualifies you for an offline job, a verified 21 profile qualifies you for online tasks, payable in bitcoin,"" he said. The Gerson Lehrman Group, an expert network that provides independent consulting services, offers a service like this, although it is aimed at survey participants, rewarding users with virtual event credits and monetary reimbursement. ""Think of it like a hybrid of LinkedIn and Amazon Mechanical Turk,"" Srinivasan said. John Light, head of product marketing at Abra, a bitcoin-based mobile app for remittances, suggested the paid email use case is merely a way to market the tasks platform. ""The email application seems like a useful idea, especially for those getting a lot of inbound requests and they need to apply some filter to decide what’s worth responding to – especially if those people are outside your network,"" Light said. ""The messaging product is also useful because it’s public-facing … and acts as a marketing tool."" Although others, like Wayne Vaughan, founder and CEO of Tierion, remain skeptical – not only of the paid inbox, but also of the tasks platform. In today’s world, social signals such as getting introduced by a mutual friend are generally seen as more valuable than monetary compensation, Vaughan suggested. ""Putting a price on that … it's like if I want to tell you something interesting, but you ask for $50 to do that, I want to tell you to go screw yourself,"" he said. Not to mention, high prices put some people – such as young entrepreneurs or developers and small publication journalists – at a disadvantage. ""It’s not a perfect solution,"" conceded Light, ""but it’s a new option for purely unsolicited messages with no pre-applied filter."" Of course, there will always be other channels on which people can reach out, such as the public networks like Twitter. On these, though, account holders aren’t guaranteed to respond, and surely, said Light, they would if someone paid them to. As an added incentive for some, the money received from incoming emails or earned from tasks can be donated to three different “tech-savvy and bitcoin-friendly” charities, said Srinivasan. ""Because price is a signal, money could be a very interesting way to prioritize messages,"" he argued. ""At the same time, the recipients often don’t actually need the money, so donating it to a good cause is a creative solution."" Yet, some like Vaughan are still doubtful. All in all, Vaughan (and other observers) wonders if 21 isn’t trying to amass a large user base, a new asset so the company can sell. ""If you’re trying to sell your company and show fast customer acquisition this might be a way to do it,"" he said. But maybe it's more about finding a business model that gains traction, allowing 21 to drill down on a specific use case, Light argued. While the move isn't necessarily a desperation play, Vaughan thinks 21's ability to raise money could be limited since its mining equipment business hasn't worked itself into a commercial success as of yet. In Vaughan’s mind, this is the latest pivot that shows a company experimenting with revenue-generating business models. He concluded: Images via 21 Inc

                            China's Central Bank Issues New Warning to Bitcoin Exchanges                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-central-bank-issues-new-warnings-bitcoin-exchanges/," The People's Bank of China issued a new statement today in which it laid out in writing the warning it issued to nine domestic startups in a meeting yesterday. The post, issued via the central bank’s website, confirmed rumors that circulated yesterday suggesting that the new meetings were broader than ones held earlier in the month, including a number of lesser-known bitcoin and cryptocurrency exchanges. Perhaps most notably, the PBOC indicated it has issued specific directives to the businesses, reiterating that the platforms must enforce anti-money laundering (AML) and foreign exchange regulations. The central bank said:  BTC Trade, Yunbi, HaoBTC, CHBTC, BTC100, BitBays, Yuanbao, Dahonghuo and Jubi were among the bitcoin exchange platforms in attendance, according to the statement. The announcement comes weeks after the PBOC first met with China’s ‘Big Three’ bitcoin exchanges, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, earlier in the month, in which it issued similar guidance.  Soon after, all three exchanges moved to enact trading fees. In statements, sources familiar with the meeting said exchanges have all largely agreed to limit margin trading and zero-fee trading in response to pressures from the central bank. Others have hinted that the PBOC may have other motives for the announcement. ""Somehow, they perceive the high price and the rising price as a threat,"" said one exchange executive speaking under condition of anonymity. At least one exchange, BTC Trade, has issued a statement on its website today indicating that it would now impose similar fees as its competitors. At press time, the price of bitcoin was unchanged on the news, sitting roughly $100 below its 2017 high set in January. PBOC image via Shutterstock

In this guest feature, Woo takes a tongue-in-cheek look at bitcoin's historical market performance, ultimately proposing a bitcoin-specific macroscopic trading pattern he believes can predict the price.  Here at Woobull Labs, we take data driven analysis very seriously. Today, I'm pleased to present the culmination of four years of data gathering and analysis on bitcoin trader psychology. The sketch above depicts the basic rig we used for our epic research. The dataset includes readings over four years at 10 minute intervals (210,240 readings per subject). In total, we collected the psychological brainwave pattern of 100,000 of bitcoin traders – a staggering 210,240,000,000 data points – as they tapped away on their keyboards. Yes, very epic. After filtering the brainwaves for solely emotion signatures, we found a pattern emerged. There was a very predictable repeating fractal after each and every bitcoin 'mooning' (or peak). Below is the emotional brainwave superposition of 100,000 traders. Our scientists have privately coined this brainwave pattern ""Soobmee"" (Sudden Onset Of Bitcoin Mooning Exuberance).  Exhibits A-D were the strongest imprints we found in the dataset. After many months of signal analysis, we were able to map this pattern to define a new and very important predictive trading pattern. Unlike the tried-and-tested trader patterns such as the double top, head and shoulders, cup and handle, and not to mention the most revered in crypto-land… the wedge pattern… today we unveil to the world an all new bitcoin-specific macroscopic trading pattern… the three cats and a moon pattern. (Yes seriously).  The long range bitcoin price chart below shows this fractal pattern at work:  A and B shows the pattern playing out in a bear trend, while C and D shows it playing out in a bull market. They may look different, but they are actually the same, skewed onto a bullish or bearish trend line. The signalling to watch for is one cat and two kittens that follow on from a pump and dump. Here's the pattern match below. We found that focusing your attention and listening for the meows of distressed kittens helps.  We must reiterate the time to use this pattern is after a bitcoin bubble has been sufficient to kick in irrational trader exuberance, followed by a confirmation signal of a steep price correction. Since the reader does not have the advantage of our brain signaling apparatus, we have a sketch below to help find you find this telltale signature in the crypto-trading room.  Finally, the sharp readers here may have noticed we do in fact have a new three cats and a moon signal confirmation.

Announced today, leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX has launched a prediction futures contract that it says will allow traders to bet on whether the SEC will approve the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ETF, the long-awaited US public investment vehicle that would offer exposure to the digital currency. The Hong-Kong based exchange has made this market available at a time when the speculation surrounding the potential approval of this bitcoin ETF has generated significant visibility. First filed in 2014 by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the SEC has repeatedly kicked the can down the road on a decision about its launch, a move that has set up its final deadline on 11th March. While the Winklevoss twins have already addressed many of the potential risks identified by the SEC, some believe the government agency could reject the proposed fund, though reasons vary. Perhaps most interestingly, however, the offering is a bit of an all or nothing bet for traders. BitMEX's COIN futures contract is binary, meaning that it will settle at 100 if the SEC gives the proposed fund a green light and zero if the government agency decides to either postpone its decision or reject the proposed fund.

GoGreenLight moved to buy out the miner last summer, a move that followed KnC’s bankruptcy declaration in May. GoGreenLight is a sister company of Borderlight, an IT and telecom services provider based in Uppsala. The bankruptcy bid preceded a drop in the amount of bitcoins created with each new transaction block, from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive, competitive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain. That network change took place last July. According to statements from the company and network data, GoGreenLight has begun activating the KnC hardware it obtained. Borderlight’s Sten Oscarsson said that the firm was in the midst of restarting the KnC hardware, with 25 people involved in the process. He added that the mine is being enhanced with improved tech for cooling and maintenance. Oscarsson went on to say: The firm has mined six blocks since 2nd February, according to data from wallet provider Blockchain, with the most recent being struck on 7th February. GoGreenLight accounted for 0.6% of the total bitcoin network hashrate over the past 24 hours, the data further shows. Image via Shutterstock

                            What Makes Bitcoin Great? One Scientist is On a Quest to Find Out                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/what-makes-bitcoin-great-one-academic-is-on-a-quest-to-find-out/,"Visa, PayPal, bitcoin. The last, it seems, is not like the others. You might be thinking, well, of course. It's unique compared to older institutions, ones that first made digital currency possible by storing payment data in centralized databases. But, that might be only one way of looking at it. Computer scientists and developers are quick to note that the reason bitcoin has succeeded at decentralizing its monetary system is because it improves on past computer consensus protocols, a point that Cornell associate professor Elaine Shi stressed in her presentation at the recent Stanford blockchain security conference. Even after 30 years of research, Shi explained, classical consensus protocols fail under certain conditions. But she believes bitcoin is different because it's more ""robust"". However, defining and mathematically spelling out these differences isn't so easy to do. Shi told CoinDesk: Despite the challenge, the academic seems determined to catch up. Sitting in the cold after a long day of security presentations, she chatted excitedly about bitcoin's unique properties. She noted that other recent research has sought to develop a formal security proof for bitcoin, and that thinkers from IC3 and elsewhere are now looking to help flag potential vulnerabilities and to inform future research into the protocol. Shi's curiosity was first piqued in 2010 or 2011 while she was working for the technology company Xerox PARC in Palo Alto. It was then that her friend, a hobbyist and miner, showed her the bitcoin white paper. They read through it together, fascinated. ""We tried to understand why bitcoin took off,"" she said. From her point of view, it was a big deal that the currency saw so much use compared to ecash, a technology put into the world by long-time cryptographer David Chaum in the mid-1990s. ""At that time, they adopted more sophisticated crypto. But there wasn’t so much traction,"" she said. She added that she was impressed that bitcoin, in contrast, saw more rapid adoption and uses simple cryptography – public key encryption, signatures and hash functions. ""One big thing for bitcoin was that it made the incentives right. It gave incentives to early adopters. There are various other aspects that maybe it did right in terms of incentives and possibly helped with adoption and how it gained popularity,"" she added. Later on, Shi moved to University of Maryland, where she continued her bitcoin research, and then to Cornell’s Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3), the university's center for study on all things blockchain. Her presentation at Stanford, ""Rethinking Large-Scale Consensus,"" discussed her new research, aimed at rethinking how bitcoin might work differently, but retain its unique properties. The result is her proposed 'sleepy' model of consensus. She noted that when she asked why people were exploring the use of a blockchain rather than a long-studied classical protocol, such as PBFT, people would typically respond ""because it’s more robust"". This is the common wisdom. But, she noted that from an academic perspective, it’s been difficult to even define what 'robust' means exactly. In this light, 'sleepy consensus' explores a specific piece of bitcoin's robustness: sporadic participation, where nodes can leave and enter the system as they please. It further examines whether a system can be as robust without proof-of-work, the algorithm that leads to one agreed-upon transaction history In Shi's model, there are 'sleepy' nodes (that are offline) and 'awake' nodes (that are online and active). Shi displayed images of Snow White to show each state, and to demonstrate that that nodes can shift between these two states. ""For example, when the prince kisses Snow White, she wakes up and continues to participate,"" she said. ""Snow White is a very robust princess.""  One way to test the robustness of the system is to see whether it can come to agreement when 51% of the online nodes are 'honest' (and therefore will not accept an invalid transaction), even with this property of sporadic participation. Classical models fail here. In fact, Shi went as far as to say that no classical protocol, whether synchronous or asynchronous, holds up. Not even when 99% of the online nodes are honest. She concluded that bitcoin, as conventional wisdom says, is indeed robust. It’s a system that’s been up and running for eight years, and that continues to work as long as 51% of nodes are honest. 'Sleepy' consensus builds on that robustness, but rearranges the protocol in a way that ditches bitcoin’s proof-of-work. The research team found that the tweaked system was more robust in some ways, but with the new construction, new security problems also sprung up. Work is ongoing here, and Shi said that, for now, the protocol is suitable for consortium blockchains along the lines of those released by the Linux-led Hyperledger. Though, again, there are perhaps other elements to bitcoin's 'robustness'. Another project from Shi and IC3, FruitChains, explores bitcoin’s game theoretical component, or how it incentivizes participants to act in a way that ultimately benefits everyone. The result of the research is a proposal for a 'fair blockchain', where block rewards and transaction fees are evenly distributed and there's less variance in rewards. Analyzing each piece on its own could lead to something bigger. ""In general, we need a new scientific foundation for all of this,"" Shi said. Yet, Shi emphasized that this research is not about defining things just for the sake of academic curiosity. Once people understand the protocols better, there are different, perhaps unexpected, directions to go. Broadly, researchers will have a better understanding of how public blockchains can be improved. Proof-of-work is expensive, for example, as powerful computers from around the world are currently hashing puzzles at dizzying rates to secure blockchains like bitcoin and ethereum. Many researchers, such as those working on proof-of-stake for ethereum, are trying to develop a way around these massive electricity demands. More research could help determine whether or not those efforts are in vain. Furthermore, Shi argues that it’s important to work on understanding the security of the protocol, and writing up mathematical proofs that could potentially bring to light hidden protocol flaws. “People have somehow developed these very nice intuitions, but it’s still very, very difficult to like design a provably correct protocol. That’s very, very important when you’re dealing with something like cryptocurrency, because if the protocol is broken then your money is at stake,” she said. A 'provably correct' protocol, on the other hand, is one that satisfies certain mathematical requirements. She mentioned that such a protocol could help ward off future situations along the lines of The DAO – the ethereum project that ended in failure. “It’s very easy to make a mistake unless you go through this whole process,” she said. “I think that both in academia and in industry there’s this huge need for these protocols, including both consensus and cryptography.” She also argued that smart contracts require more advanced cryptography protocols. “IC3 would like to help make these secure by constructing protocols. And deploy them in the real world,” she added. Beyond all that, Shi has other research ideas. One potential project is to design a programming language that would let coders with little knowledge of cryptography create more secure apps. Programmers could state vaguely what security properties they need, and the programming language itself would decide what consensus protocol would be best used under the hood. To Shi, the ability to combine disciplines in such a way is partly what's so exciting. And, bitcoin is a rich area to experiment with cryptography in particular, she said.

                            Bitcoin Volatility Tightens After Prices Surge to 1-Month High                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-volatility-prices-surge-high/," Bitcoin prices entered rangebound trading today after soaring to their highest level in over a month. Earlier in the session, the digital currency's price climbed roughly 3%, peaking at an average of $1,054.73 – the highest since 5th January, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The price rally came as traders responded to a recent uptick in market sentiment and overnight reports that the People's Bank of China's foreign exchange reserves had declined. Following this ascent, bitcoin prices pulled back somewhat, falling slightly lower to $1,046.24 by 15:30 UTC, a less than 1% decline from the daily high, BPI data shows. The digital currency's price began to rise once again over the next few hours, increasing by 0.3% to $1,049.83 by 17:45 UTC. These modest fluctuations continued over the next several hours, with bitcoin prices dropping 0.2% to $1,047.46 at 19:30 UTC and then appreciating 0.3% to $1,050.67 by 21:00 UTC. At press time, the average price of bitcoin is $1,051.75, according to the BPI. The relative lack of volatility that bitcoin prices saw during the latter part of today's session may be the latest sign that the digital currency is experiencing a new trend of more modest price fluctuations. This reduced volatility has become more apparent since major Chinese exchanges BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi opted to eliminate margin trading and begin charging trading fees. Image via Shutterstock

The move comes months after officials for the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) signaled their intention to regulate exchanges, suggesting at the time that they would class the businesses as a form of remittance company. Under guidelines inked on 16th January and published today, ""entities"" that offer exchange services will be required to apply for a Certificate of Registration. Exchanges will also need to register with the country’s Anti-Money Laundering Council Secretariat, the document shows, and while currently unspecified, exchanges will also be subject to ""registration and annual fee services"". In statements, the central bank positioned the regulations from the perspective of anti-money laundering and financial stability, echoing a 2014 warning it issued about digital currencies. The BSP said: Mirroring other regulatory approaches, domestic exchanges are now subject to annual and quarterly reporting requirements. The central bank is applying reporting penalties to exchanges. Further, the BSP document outlines security criteria exchanges in the Philippines must follow. ""For VC exchanges providing wallet services for holding, storing and transferring VCs, an effective cybersecurity program encompassing storage and transaction security requirements as well as sound key management practices must be established to ensure the integrity and security of VC transactions and wallets,"" the central bank said.

                            Inside MAST: The Little-Known Plan to Advance Bitcoin Smart Contracts                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/inside-mast-little-known-plan-advance-bitcoin-smart-contracts/,"Despite being the largest and longest-running blockchain, bitcoin isn't exactly known for its programming features. In an age when new blockchain projects continually promise bigger and better (and platforms like ethereum openly court more novice coders), bitcoin has even prized its simpler, safer construction. But that's not to say that work isn't ongoing to bring more advanced functionality to the network. If and when a certain contentious code change upgrade called SegWit is deployed (and this remains an if), protocol developers say that it could pave the way for a range of new technical improvements. This includes the long-standing Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees (MAST) upgrade, a concept packaged into an official proposal by Bitcoin Core developer Johnson Lau in early 2016. Another new piece of cutting-edge cryptography, MAST doesn't enable new smart contracts per se, but by reducing the size of the data necessary for bitcoin scripts, it enables ""complicated redemption conditions"" that aren't currently viable partially because of space constraints. Lau told CoinDesk: On a more technical level, MAST could be described as an extension to Pay to Script Hash. By using Merkle trees (the same data structure that stores transactions in bitcoin blocks), it enables a new way of embedding and processing scripts that offers more scalability and privacy. It sounds technical (and perhaps like a minor change), but many bitcoin developers are excited by the potential because they believe it expands bitcoin’s ability to be used as ""programmable money"". Stepping back for a minute, a 'smart contract' is a term that refers to a snippet of code that enforces rules on its own, without leaning on an intermediary to interpret the rules and settle disputes when they arise. Although the tendency is to think of smart contracts as more complex programs, every bitcoin payment uses one. Unless the sender provides the right digital signature (proving that he or she is the owner), the network won’t transfer the bitcoin. Yet, as mentioned, that definition might sound underwhelming in the context of ethereum, the alternative blockchain applications platform that allows developers to create virtually any kind of smart contract. Lau noted as much. ""For smart contracts to be really ‘smart’, it should allow people doing something more than simple payment,"" he said. It's worth noting, too, that bitcoin’s scripting language previously supported more complex types of smart contracts. However, the digital currency’s still-pseudonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto had to rip many of them out back in 2010 when he or she realized that there were bugs that malicious actors could use to clog the network with spam. It's taken a while to build that functionality back up. With this in mind, Lau has put together another bitcoin proposal for a bundle of new 'opcodes' (enabling new smart contracts), many of which have been brought back in a testing environment, saying these would likely be rolled out in tandem with MAST. He added that his proposal could further reinstate some that were torn out seven years ago. Although, once the time comes, Lau noted that he doesn’t expect that all of the opcodes proposed in the BIP (bitcoin improvement proposal) to be accepted. ""Even only a few (eg OP_CAT or OP_XOR) would enable things that are not possible today,"" he said. And, again, these would be bundled with MAST. There are also practical uses for these features, and Lau pointed to a couple of use cases for MAST combined with the new opcodes. One is a betting scheme ""without any trust needed"", he said. His example implementation uses the proposed opcodes OP_XOR and OP_RSHIFT, but he noted that there are other script combinations called 'covenants' that accomplish the same thing. These restrict how users can use funds, and are“frequently requested, according to Lau"". Blockstream unveiled last year that it has been experimenting with covenants on a test sidechain – a blockchain with a different rule system that is pegged to bitcoin. The idea is to give users more control over their bitcoin, even if it’s stolen. Say you want to send your bitcoin to an exchange, but you’re worried about the exchange losing funds, as happened with Mt Gox. Using a construction called a 'vault', perhaps the best-known example of a covenant, users can send their bitcoin to new address along with a certain type of script. Effectively, that script has the power to suck your bitcoin back in the case of a Mt Gox-style hack. This construction would require the new opcodes OP_CAT and OP_CHECKSIGFROMSTACK. It’s worth noting, though, that some developers are skeptical that vaults would work, and think that the protecting funds would be better achieved by other means. That said, there are many types of covenants. Co-founder of MIT Digital Currency Initiative Jeremy Rubin described a variety of other examples in a presentation at the Stanford blockchain security conference last week. And, there are other miscellaneous ideas of how MAST might be used (which seem to pop up randomly and often when chatting with bitcoin developers). Lightning Labs engineer Olaoluwa Osuntokun, who also presented at Stanford, mentioned that MAST could even improve the Lightning Network. This top-layer network, aimed to boost bitcoin capacity, needs someone to monitor the channel used to connect parties in the transaction in the case one tries to cheat. MAST could help with outsourcing this need to a third party, as it reduces the storage space required to do so. Beyond MAST and the opcodes bundled with it, there are other smart contract ideas floating around. At least two groups are working on opcodes that would alter bitcoin to add sidechains functionality, mentioned earlier. However, like many other features, SegWit would make it easier, because it rolls out a new way of making big consensus changes. Lightning Network co-creator Joseph Poon mentioned in a recent presentation that his proposed implementation will use an interesting system of smart contracts emerging from a few opcodes that are in bitcoin already. As far as MAST, R&D is ongoing. In conversation with CoinDesk, Rubin noted that he’s been thinking through a new, potentially better way of implementing the same thing. But, for the time being, the contentious code change SegWit seems to be the main obstacle. Yet, even if the consensus change isn’t activated in the next eight months, Lau noted that there is another ""less elegant"" way of bypassing the transaction malleability problem and thus adding support for MAST – a move that could help place bitcoin back in the broader smart contracts conversation.

Bolstered by buoyed sentiment (and the increasing unlikelihood that China’s central bank will again step in and correct the market), bitcoin breached $1,050 at 13:00 UTC amid a near-3% increase for the day so far. The total marked the highest point observed on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) since 6th January, just a day after the price dropped nearly $200 within hours of hovering near all-time highs set in late 2013 (a move that was widely attributed to the widespread use of market leverage). The price movements come amid an uptick in volume that followed a substantial decline in volume at major exchanges. Data from Bitcoinity shows the market is up slightly since three major China-based exchanges to begin imposing fees on both sides of bitcoin trades, a market change that is still being widely felt.  Yet, there is still some tepid sentiment in the market, as put forward by China-based OTC trader Zhou Shouji. He maintains that ""no one knows"" if further actions will be taken, though he indicated some may be preparing for this scenario. Shouji suggested China-based traders see the increasing price as a potential red flag for domestic regulators, even while others positioned it as a more natural recovery. Image via Shutterstock

The village of Vernon Hills, Illinois, is currently in possession of roughly $10,000 worth of the digital currency, according to The Chicago Tribune. That amount, seized last year during a criminal drug investigation by local police and federal agencies, is set to be sold off in the days ahead. Local officials approved a plan to use Coinbase to sell the confiscated coins during a town meeting on 24th January. While not as flashy as one of the US Marshals’ bitcoin auctions or the $19m worth sold in Australia last year, the Vernon Hills story illustrates the questions local jurisdictions face when coming into possession of bitcoin following a criminal investigation. The village has a population of about 25,000 people, according to US Census data. The Tribune quoted Vernon Hills finance chief Nikki Larson, who told town officials: Curiously, it won’t be the last time that Vernon Hills receives a small windfall – which will be directed to local police coffers – from a bitcoin bust. In the months ahead, local police are expected to finalize another criminal investigation that will involve a bitcoin asset forfeiture. As that process comes to a close, Vernon Hills officials will hold yet another bitcoin sale. Image via Shutterstock

For bugs that aren’t as critical, admins said they would offer 1 BTC, with 0.05 BTC being put up for display issues and other minor problems. There are rules for the program, however. Prospective bounty hunters are asked not to make the exploits public prior to disclosing them to the market’s operators, or undertake any attacks that might harm Hansa users. The more details that are provided, the admins wrote, ""the higher the chance a payout will be awarded"". The admins went on to explain: In a way, the bug bounty program further highlights the dark market ecosystem’s continued use of bitcoin as a financial tool. Years before, it was the now-defunct Silk Road that relied on bitcoin as a payment tool, though today markets have begun looking to other digital currencies like monero. Social media posts suggest that at least one site-critical bug has been identified, with CyberScoop reporting that others had been found since the program’s launch. Image via Shutterstock

Public records show that at the end of last year, the North Dakota Senate’s Industry, Business and Labor Committee put forward Bill 2100, which included language for a report on the feasibility of regulating bitcoin. The bill was introduced at the request of the state’s Department of Financial Institutions, the chief finance regulator for the state. The measure was passed unanimously in the Senate on 12th January with 46 votes. The legislature’s lower chamber has since taken up the bill, though no hearings have been scheduled as of yet. However, the rapid pace in the Senate suggests that the study is likely to be approved once representatives put the measure to a vote. If passed and signed by Gov. Doug Burgum, the study would put North Dakota on the path to introducing specific regulations for digital currencies. As the bill explains: The legislative proposal comes amid a flurry of activity amongst US state legislatures on the bitcoin and blockchain front. Last month, two lawmakers in Washington proposed prohibiting businesses in the state’s cannabis industry from using bitcoin and other digital currencies. That bill, still under deliberation, was the subject of a hearing on 27th January that saw both supporters and critics speak out. Legislators in Hawaii are pushing for a study of how blockchain could benefit the state while New Hampshire is looking at how it can tinker with its financial oversight rules to account for digital currency traders. And just last week, a state representative in Arizona filed a bill that would restrict the use of blockchain-based tracking systems for local firearms owners. Image via Shutterstock

It’s afternoon in the ‘Miner in the World’ WeChat, one of the rare channels that bridges bitcoin's strained east-west communications divide. But the alarm isn’t being sounded by a miner. Rather, it’s from bitcoin developer Matt Corallo, and he’s up in arms about an issue many of his peers now believe could have accidentally split the $15bn economic network. Corallo quickly posts more links to explain the situation, which boils down to this: a bitcoin mining pool processed an invalid block that was rejected by other nodes and miners. As it happens block after block, day after day, the pool found the correct hash and broadcasted it to the network. In short, it should have been able to retrieve the current block reward, earning roughly $11,000, but it wasn't able to. In this case, the pool, Bitcoin.com, was running code that was different than most the network. Unlike all previous blocks, the block generated wasn’t 1MB, but larger. Quickly, someone in the channel pings Roger Ver, its owner. ""I don’t know which versions of Bitcoin Unlimited are safe,"" Corallo continues. ""Their bug report seems to say anything before 1.0 is fine, but I don’t know."" ""The bug?"" another asks. ""The bug where it makes blocks which are ignored by the network and you lose 13 BTC,"" Corallo shoots back. ""If SPV miner found block, BTC forked,"" a China-based miner adds. Finally, Ver arrives. ""You could also look at it that Bitcoin Core has had a bug all these years with 1MB incorrectly defined. It seems like Core should have fixed that bug already,"" he says, going on the attack. Tensions quickly flare and within minutes the thread mirrors that vitriol that has spilled across bitcoin social media sites for nearly two years. ""Roger, this is getting ridiculous,"" another Core developer says. And there’s a growing chorus of bitcoin developers and users that agree. If there was a single person who could have brought unity to bitcoin’s longest and hardest-fought debate, Roger Ver might have been it. An early investor and ‘true believer’ of the technology, Ver began backing bitcoin-related startups at a time when the number of people interested in the idea could have fit into a tiny room. It was love at first sight, and he showed his adoration by throwing thousands of dollars a month into pro-bitcoin advertisements on more than 100 radio stations, even buying space for the first billboard promoting the cryptocurrency. His passion for bitcoin made sense. After an unsuccessful run for California State Assembly in 2000 (and a stint of 10 months in federal prison for the illegal sale of what the US Department of Justice called 'explosives' and what Ver called 'fireworks'), Ver had developed a distrust of authorities. As the price of bitcoin rose and Ver’s net worth grew, there were excited accounts of a charismatic libertarian who preached individual economic freedom. It could be said Ver both gave the monetary movement a face that it didn’t have in bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, and that he helped further develop the ideology that the cryptographic network should be a digital cash, one out of the control of the powers that be. For all this, fans gave him the nickname 'Bitcoin Jesus', a Biblical charge that seems to hold as much significance now, even as his standing in the community has changed. For those who have remained on the sidelines, bitcoin’s 'block size debate' largely rests on two issues, one technological, the other social. On the surface, it’s a battle over whether bitcoin’s developers should change a rather minute rule in the open-source protocol (the 1MB cap on the number of transactions the miners are able to approve). But, to some, it's more philosophical, centering on whether this change would fit within the vision of its original inventor, Satoshi Nakamoto. On one side is Bitcoin Core, the group of developers working on bitcoin’s most widely used software. This group has advocated for code called Segregated Witness, which would boost transaction capacity (among other optimizations) but leave the contentious block size rule unchanged. Effectively, the change would provide the network with a capacity equivalent to a 2.1MB block size, advocates say. (Instead of changing the old rule (‘MAX_BLOCK_BASE_SIZE’), a new variable (‘MAX_BLOCK_WEIGHT') would be introduced). To proponents, Bitcoin Core’s philosophy is one that emphasizes creativity and safety. SegWit would use a mechanism called a soft fork to enact its change, meaning that those using the network would not be forced to pick between two competing versions of the software when an update is introduced. (The hard fork process would be similar to if, every time your iPhone needed an upgrade, your failure to do so would mean you were forever on another communications branch). As highlighted by ethereum’s hard fork last year, such a scenario can be problematic. In the case of ethereum, there are now two versions of the open-source software, both running largely similar feature sets, but backed by different communities and cultures. In bitcoin’s case, this divergence is already occurring, though as the Bitcoin Unlimited bug showed, it’s a fight that’s being carried out on the main bitcoin blockchain. There's also an argument about a perceived over-centralization of the technology within the block size debate. For bitcoin to be successful, some argue it needs to be widely distributed, meaning its infrastructure (nodes and miners) need to be anywhere and everywhere, free from mass corruption, influence, or exploitation. Larger blocks, Core argues, might dissuade some users from running full nodes which could lead to a small group of people having too much control over the network. Ver’s argument essentially boils down to this: bitcoin needs to scale right now because of increased demand. And to do so, the block size should be bigger. A bigger block size, in Ver’s mind, will allow far more consumers and businesses to start using the protocol, making censorship through centralization a non-issue. ""The best strategy to not have censorship, to not be controlled, is to have more people using bitcoin, so the government can’t just say it’s drug dealers using it,"" Ver said. But, with Bitcoin Core unwilling to do the work (or introduce a proposal to the network), Ver has taken matters into his own hands, helping to collect more than $1m to fund alternative developers. Ver’s mining pool is running this code (one that's also being run by a few mining pools that disagree with Core’s approach to scaling the network). It has proven to be controversial, and the issue last weekend found the Bitcoin Unlimited developer team has been accused of deploying ""untested and buggy"" code. Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell argued that the code that introduced the bug didn't appear to have ""peer review of any kind"". Though, the error was fixed by the development team within a few hours due to monitoring. According to Blockstream CEO Adam Back, the worst-case scenario goes something like this: by using a process called 'SPV mining', other pools began building on the invalid block sent out by Bitcoin.com for a time. Essentially, SPV mining meant that the miners were accepting blocks found by other miners without first validating whether they met the network rules. Should this have continued, Core’s team argues the results could have been far-reaching. “I think we’re lucky that they didn’t find a block. If they found a valid block on top of an invalid block, then they would have all got banned from the network, and we might have ended up with a sort of network split, where 60% of the miners are off on their own chain,” he said. “In short, the whole BU concept is fatally flawed ... and the fact that some miners are not even fully validating blocks compounds the problem,” developer Eric Lombrozo added. Yet, Ver has prominent supporters. One is bitcoin miner and operator of the ViaBTC mining pool Haipo Yang. Yang is an operator of one of the newer mining pools, but has already generated complaints for his favored stance – that SegWit has little to do with scaling and that all the main devs should be fired. ""As a programer, I believe the SegWit is pointless and very harmful to bitcoin,"" he said. Yang argues that SegWit would change bitcoin more than other proposals. He believes there’s very little chance of a split, as Core claims, in the event of a hard fork because everyone wants to scale (with the exception of Bitcoin Core). When asked about Ver, he called him “a great man”, largely for the way he has stood up to the developers on the issue. Another staunch supporter is Peter Rizun, the chief scientist of Bitcoin Unlimited, who sees the issue similarly. “Bigger blocks are needed to allow bitcoin to continue growing, the same way it did for the first seven years,” Rizun said. According to Rizun, Bitcoin Unlimited is merely stripping the protocol of its block size limit that was implemented by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2010. Everyone involved acknowledges the limit is largely arbitrary, and that it was merely intended to act as a throttle for the network. “The limit is now having an economic effect and isn’t serving the role Satoshi had in mind,” Rizun continued, throwing in another appeal: But just how much data science is involved in the debate remains unclear. As with the ongoing “fake news” scandal in the political world (where the public largely remains awestruck at the discord), only a handful of people in the world perhaps know bitcoin’s inner-workings enough to really understand the issue or evaluate proposed code. One difference is the experience level of those involved. Bitcoin’s Core team boasts researchers who have been actively deploying code for nearly a decade in a hostile, real-time environment. The other side argues it's more passionate, resourceful and that it more clearly understands the vision. But there could be indications in how the groups are carrying out their messaging. Ver contends that bitcoin-based businesses are struggling with network inefficiencies, and that’s why more exchanges are adding support for alternative cryptocurrencies. He points to Coinbase, Xapo and Blockchain as businesses that will be negatively affected by bridling the block size (though, none of those companies seem as passionate as Ver about alternatives to Bitcoin Core’s proposal). Xapo president Ted Rogers said the company isn’t evaluating the scaling debate, while Blockchain’s vice president of growth, Liana Douillet Guzmán was cautiously optimistic about the solution put forward by the core developers. “I’m hopeful that SegWit in concert with Lightning Networks (like Thunder) can help remedy a lot of the current backlog, but we won’t know the impact, if any, it will have until SegWit is deployed,” Guzmán said. Still, Ver alleges other mainstream businesses are being dissuaded from using bitcoin. “I know a company with over a 100 million users that put their bitcoin integration on hold because [the network] wouldn’t handle its scale,” Ver told CoinDesk. “That’s really frustrating to me as someone that has done everything I can to get more people to use bitcoin.” Ver declined to provide the name of the company, but it’s worth examining the claim. Even if said enterprise integrates bitcoin, it doesn’t mean all of its users will immediately start using the functionality. According to Ver, though, more enterprises would offer an on-ramp into bitcoin were it not for network congestion, long transaction times and hefty fees. Although Ver’s claims have been found to be half-truths in some instances. For example, Ver recently took to Twitter to complain that even when he paid the suggested $0.06 transaction fee on a $23,000 transaction, it hadn’t been confirmed 12 hours later. It was later found out that actually one of the transaction’s inputs suffered from transaction malleability (the issue that SegWit, the proposal favored by Core, is said to resolve). He also took aim about paying a $75 transaction fee. And while he did pay that fee, Ver left out some important information, according to Bitcoin Core developer Todd, namely that the transaction was hundreds of times bigger than the average transaction. To Todd, these white lies aren’t working in Ver’s favor: It’s hard to say that Ver hasn’t gone to extreme measures to espouse his views. In addition to running the Bitcoin.com mining pool and news portal, Ver operates his own channel on the popular social network Reddit. Called r/btc, the subreddit was started in direct response to censorship of certain views on r/bitcoin, the technology’s most popular forum. Ver argues that he’s been censored from r/bitcoin on numerous occasions because he brings an opinion that doesn’t align with Core’s. “It’s pretty much impossible to reach consensus with all the censorship,” Ver said. “Core devs and those supporters are the ones doing most of the censorship, and we shouldn’t trust people that censor stuff to run a censorship resistant network.” But Ver has been implicated in doing the same on r/BTC; (At the Satoshi Roundtable in Cancun, one of the forum’s former moderators even acknowledged that the platform has all but collapsed into an unreliable source of vitriol). For all his supposed open-mindedness, Ver seems focused on selling rhetoric that drives discussion to a platform he makes money from advertising on. “The sad thing about all this is it’s so petty,” Todd said. While Core developers are largely critical, Ver seems of two minds about their work, on one hand reverting back to his pleasant, conquer-the-world-via-entrepreneurship persona even as he throws barbs and accusations. In interview, Ver acknowledges that even Bitcoin Core has the protocol’s best intentions at heart, although in the next breath he contends all the Core developers should be fired. “They have absolutely and utterly failed to scale to keep up with demand,” he said. The tensions seem partly economic. Armed with more users, Ver reasons, the price of bitcoin would increase, thereby liberating more people from traditional fiat monies. “That’s the measure we have for how many people see benefit there,” he said. “For bitcoin to rival the dollar or the euro, the price will have to be much higher than it is today.” Despite all this, however, Ver remains one of the more captivating proponents of bitcoin, advocating for what any of his supporters see as their stake in the network – and their vision for its use. “When I started using bitcoin more than four years ago, I was buying into a vision of a fast, cheap and global system that could be used by anyone, whether they are wealthy or financially disenfranchised,” said Jake Smith, general manager of Bitcoin.com. While others have technical appeals, Smith’s is unique in that it’s personal. To him, this is something he’s spent years of his life on. And it’s easy to sympathize. There was a time when writing about bitcoin didn’t entail scouring through pages of reports issued by companies on incidents with their specific implementations at bitcoin's innermost layers. Rather than being caught in a he-said, she-said game on minute technical issues, there were massive funding rounds, tales of user growth and grand plans to reinvent the financial system. But, not everything has changed, and maybe that's another source of conflict. ""I’m willing to put my money where my mouth is,"" Ver once said in a famous 2011 video, one where he bet $10,000 would outperform gold and silver by 100x. It seemed crazy at the time, visionary in retrospect. Only time will tell if this bet turns out the same.  Pete Rizzo contributed reporting. Image via cryptograffiti

                            Bullish Sentiment Fuels Bitcoin's Return to $1,000                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bullish-sentiment-fuels-bitcoins-return-to-1000/," Bitcoin prices experienced notable gains this week, pushing higher as sentiment recovered from the lagging impact of market turmoil. The digital currency rose to as much as $1,024.14 on 3rd February, roughly 11.5% above its opening price of $918.56 on 28th January, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $1,015.11, slightly below the weekly high. This sharp gain compared to the tepid increase of 3% generated during the week through 27th January, and the more notable rise of 7.9% produced during the prior week. Bitcoin’s price volatility was reasonably calm during this two-week period, as it relaxed after an intense price fluctuations experienced around the start of the year. Still, greater growth was seen outside the US dollar markets. CNY-denominated bitcoin managed to enjoy even more robust gains, surging more than 20% during the week to a high of ¥7,186.17 after opening the week at ¥5,964.90, additional BPI figures show. At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at ¥7,129.10, less than 1% below the weekly high reached earlier on 3rd February.  Analysts pointed to the recent improvement in sentiment as the impetus for the increases. Earlier this month, trader sentiment encountered headwinds when bitcoin’s sharp price volatility motivated the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) to intervene and meet with major Chinese exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin. The startups later eliminated margin trading and began charging trading fees, two developments some have speculated would help reduce volatility. However, bitcoin trading volume flooded to no-fee exchanges, which once again raised the question of which trading volume figures were reliable. More recently, traders have become more optimistic, according to several market observers. Algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff emphasized the key role that China’s investors and traders play in the bitcoin market, as well as their recent uptick in trading activity. He stated that while their exact motivations may not be clear, it is certain that while these market participants “shied away from bitcoin” over the last few weeks, they “have come roaring back"". Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, also stressed how PBoC intervention affected trader sentiment. ""This was seen as a sign of legitimacy for bitcoin,"" he said. Still, there are some who are waiting on further announcements. Zhou Shouji, operator of China OTC trading firm FinTech Blockchain Group, said he is convinced further PBoC actions are forthcoming. ""Everyone is waiting for the next PBoC action,"" he said. Further, he worried that without margin trading and automated trading, prices could collapse more quickly on any negative moves. Already, exchanges appear to be expressing an eagerness to remove fees, with OKCoin pulling back an announcement it would ease prices. At press time, Huobi said it was not involved in any conversations to lower fees, while BTCC did not offer any statement. Yet, all this is occurring amid improving sentiment. Zivkovski spoke to how market dynamics helped fuel this rally: ""This bull run was fueled by shorts closing, hence powering price up with more thrust, as well as a lack of sell orders on many exchanges, which created a liquidity vacuum that allowed price to rise quickly,"" he said. The robust nature of trader sentiment is illustrated by Whaleclub data, which shows that the market was an average of 84% long in the seven days between 28th January and 3rd February. During all but one of these sessions, the market was at least 80% long. Confidence, the extent by which a session’s positions are larger than usual, was an average of 82% during the seven days, and was at least 80% in six of the last seven sessions. Going forward, these market dynamics could help bitcoin create support at $1,000, something that would be ""a first,"" according to Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management. He emphasized that ""It will take a bit for $1,000 to become a support level,"" pointing to the price fluctuations taking place over the last 24 hours. Featured image via Shutterstock

In a post on its China-based website, OKCoin indicated that it would alter its policies to a maker-taker model, one that would offer zero-fee trading to those who provide liquidity to the exchange. A 0.2% fee would still be charged on all other trades. Notably, the notice no longer appears on OKCoin's website. If enacted, the move would be the first since 23rd January that finds a major China-based exchange breaking from an informal commitment to charge 0.2% fees on both sides of bitcoin-denominated trades, spurred by scrutiny from the People’s Bank of China. As previously reported, volume has moved since those developments, largely to other no-fee exchanges based in China. BTCC CEO Bobby Lee said at the time that the commitment to a standard trading fee policy was meant to keep China's exchange ecosystem ""one step ahead"" of requests by the central bank. The post is notable, however, even if the fee changes are not enacted, as it suggests that the decline in volumes at major China-based markets may be putting pressure on the exchanges to win back lost activity. OKCoin did not respond to requests for further comment at press time. The notice can be found in full below:  Image via Shutterstock

                            Litecoin Moves to Adopt Bitcoin's SegWit Scaling Upgrade                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/litecoin-moves-to-adopt-bitcoins-segwit-scaling-upgrade/,"A code update best known for its polarizing role in bitcoin's scaling debate has just made its debut on another blockchain. As of this morning, miners securing the alternative blockchain litecoin can now begin signaling support for Segregated Witness. Known popularly as SegWit, the upgrade changes the way that data is stored within a digital currency transaction, allowing more transactions to take up less space on the network while adding other optimizations. The introduction sets up an interesting dynamic as some bitcoin developers now believe the upgrade is perhaps more likely be implemented on litecoin, as voluntary adoption of the change by bitcoin's miners has largely stalled. After rising quickly to 25% in November, miners are now showing signs their support may be shifting to a user-configured block size by way of Bitcoin Unlimited. The protracted path to bitcoin scaling hasn’t stopped other digital currencies from adopting the SegWit approach, however. Back in December, word emerged that litecoin would move to adopt SegWit, a direction that creator Charlie Lee later elaborated on in a post on Medium. At time of writing, just over 11% of the network's miners have voiced their support, while other data sources point to support hovering at over 15%. At least one major litecoin miner, F2Pool, has reportedly indicated that it will support the measure in the near future. If the network reaches the predetermined threshold of 75% of miners, SegWit will become the law of the land. Bitcoin has notably set its threshold for SegWit higher, requiring 95% adoption for two weeks. To some observers, the plan could essentially offer a real-world test subject for SegWit, meaning proponents in the bitcoin world will surely be watching. Ladder in the sky image via Shutterstock

It concluded that, while virtual currencies are not subject to any separate regulation under Polish legislation, it is subject to income tax. The ministry also stated: To further explore the legal and financial implications of the use of virtual currencies in Poland, the country's government has established an expert group on blockchain and virtual currencies.

",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-inches-1000-will-last/," Bitcoin prices breached $1,000 for the first time in nearly one month today. The price saw initial fluctuations around that level before climbing higher, hitting a high of over $1,009 before settling around $1,007 at press time, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. Yet to analysts, the development raises the question of whether markets will see continued action above the $1,000 mark, and some say the digital currency may need to work its way through significant resistance before it is able to find support at that level. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, told CoinDesk: The desire among traders to book profits could also be a major factor in the trading sessions ahead. Some may feel motivation to sell at price points between $1,000 and $1,200, leading the digital currency to face an uphill fight at these levels, Zivkovski posited. The digital currency first broke through $1,000 today at 16:30 UTC, just barely surpassing this level when it reached a high of $1,000.31. However, bitcoin prices quickly changed direction, falling below $1,000 to reach a low of $999.01 at 17:45 UTC, additional BPI figures show. The cryptocurrency proceeded to fluctuate around the $1,000 level, rising to $1,000.85 by 18:00 UTC and then falling to a low of $999.84 at 18:15 UTC. But while $1,000-level may be enough to generate significant visibility in the Western world, the ¥7,000 level is just as critical, according to analyst Tim Enneking. At the time of report, bitcoin had failed to exceed this level during the 2nd February session, having risen to as much as ¥6,976.50 earlier in the day. Enneking elaborated on the key relationship between the $1,000 and ¥7,000 levels, telling CoinDesk: According to some observers, the price could encounter headwinds from negative sentiment that still lingers following the cryptocurrency’s sharp price movements this year – which saw bitcoin rise above $1,150 and then fall close to $200 in an hour. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, attributed this sentiment to the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) decision to closely scrutinize the domestic bitcoin exchange ecosystem. That said, Hayes did offer a positive view of the situation. ""The market is slowly shedding the fear of drastic action take by the PBoC against Chinese Bitcoin exchanges,"" he told CoinDesk. ""As this fear fades, the price will slowly retrace towards to the all-time high reached in early January."" Market data, according to sources, bears out that sense of cautious positivity. Whaleclub sentiment data shows that the market was 89% long torday, representing the third consecutive trading session during which this measure was at least 80%. In addition, confidence – the extent by which a position size is larger than average – was 82% on 2nd February, after measuring 85% during the prior two sessions.

                            Bitcoin's Privacy Gets 'Failing Grade' in 2016 Threat Report                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-privacy-2016-threat-report/,"A new report by an open-source advocacy group has found that bitcoin users still face major threats to their privacy. The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project (OBPP) published its latest study today, which explores the state of bitcoin privacy throughout 2016 and identifies key vulnerabilities in the ecosystem. Composed of developers and researchers in the bitcoin space, OBPP has previously weighed in on user privacy issues related to bitcoin wallets, releasing two editions on the subject since 2015. The newest report identifies four major threats that confronted bitcoin users over the past year. These include the merging of co-owned funds into single transactions; the re-use of bitcoin addresses; the linking of network identity to a particular bitcoin address; and the linking of addresses together through network activity. The publication perhaps speaks to one of the key underlying aspects of bitcoin itself, given that the digital currency provides a pseudonymous, open-access means of moving money throughout the world. For some, financial privacy is one of the reasons they turned to the digital currency in the first place. It also highlights how cybersecurity risks can undercut those characteristics, as well as what steps can be taken to reduce the threats involved. For example, OBPP suggests the utilization of the Tor network or similar tools – which route data to different points around the world, obscuring its origin and destination – to avoid having one’s identity tied to a particular node. The report's release comes as regulators worldwide see the privacy-enhancing features of digital currencies as a growing concern. Last month, for instance, a group of law enforcement agencies and organizations, including Interpol and Europol, called for a crackdown on transaction mixers, or tools that can obfuscate the source of funds by combining them with other transactions. During a recent conversation with CoinDesk ahead of the report's release, OBPP contributor Kristov Atlas described the state of privacy in the ecosystem today as ""pretty bad"", noting that work on wallet privacy has fizzed out in the past year or two. He went on to state: As for what’s driving the deficiencies around privacy, Atlas highlighted regulatory issues as well as technical ones, suggesting that it’s likely ""a confluence of challenges"" inhibiting broader focus. Challenges aside, Atlas stressed his belief that privacy should be prioritized by companies who offer tools for transacting in bitcoin. ""I think it’s important to try to get these privacy concerns on the to-do lists of companies and remind them that it’s important, and that it’s something they haven’t fully tackled yet,"" he said.

                            459 Million Bitcoins: Exchange Volume Reached Peak Levels in Q4                        ",Bradley Miles,https://www.coindesk.com/459-million-bitcoins-exchange-volume-reached-peak-levels-q4/,"Bradley Miles is an analyst at CoinDesk Research where he contributes to CoinDesk's quarterly State of Blockchain report. In this piece, Miles releases early findings from our forthcoming State of Blockchain 2017 report, due out in February.  The fourth quarter of 2016 was a volatile period for the price of bitcoin, as speculation climbed to new heights and exchange-traded volume reached peak levels, according to data provider Bitcoinity. Even before bitcoin approached $1,000 at the end of Q4, a record 114m bitcoins were exchanged in the month of October alone. The record was shattered in the following month with 175m bitcoins traded in November, followed by a slight downtick in December with 170m bitcoins exchanging hands. Exchange-traded volume for bitcoin experienced a 275% quarter-over-quarter increase to 459 million bitcoins in Q4 of 2016, from 122 million bitcoins in Q3.  Compared the figures year-on-year, trading volume in Q4 of 2016 jumped up 206% from 150m bitcoins traded in Q4 of 2015.  Yet, the volumes from Q4 only tell part of the story. A large concentration of exchange-traded volume typically occurs in China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchanges: BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin (at least, before they recently announced sweeping policy changes). The trading volume of these three alone totaled 452m bitcoins in Q4 of 2016, a staggering 98% of all trading volume for the quarter, but there is reason to believe that figure may be inflated. Some investors and entrepreneurs remain skeptical of this notorious metric, stating that the ""true volume"", or what the volume would have been if these exchanges charged trading fees, is closer to 85%. This discrepancy may not sound large, but at 98% of exchange traded volume, China's volume is about 49x the rest of the world, whereas at 85%, Chinese exchange traded volume is only around 6x as large. That's an order of magnitude reduction in sheer volume size (approximately 8.6x). As the zero-fee era of Chinese exchanges comes to a close and markets begin to stabilize following the election of Donald Trump, it’s anyone's guess as to where exchange traded volume will fall at the end of the first quarter of 2017. However, given the shake-ups at the 'Big Three', it appears the cryptocurrency community will get a look at the 'true volume' results for exchange traded bitcoins in the coming months.

That policy document included the stipulation that ""all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited"", prompting questions about both the definition of ""virtual currency"" the central bank was relying on as well as the exact scope and nature of the ostensible prohibition. New comments suggest that, at least for now, the central bank isn’t taking any action on bitcoin or other digital currencies. In a statement released to regional news service Gulf News, central bank governor Mubarak Al Mansouri said: That said, the central bank indicated that the topic of digital currencies remains an open question – and one that could be subject to new rules in the future. ""This area is currently under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate,"" Al Mansouri remarked.

Announced yesterday, the move will see the New York-based exchange, founded by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, begin crediting users for their bitcoin deposits before those transactions have been confirmed on the network. Typically, most services will wait for at least three to six confirmations before accepting a deposit as genuine. Bitcoin transactions, after being included in an initial block, become ""confirmed"" as new blocks are added to the transaction history. Now, Gemini – citing transaction delays on the bitcoin network due to congestion – is starting to credit users before the first confirmation, assuming they pass a new clearance system. The exchange explained: The move comes months after Gemini began expanding its services to Asian markets. The exchange opened its doors in late 2015 following approval by New York state regulators. The bid to offer zero-confirmation deposits is the latest move from the firm as it seeks to attract more traders – something it has struggled with since launch.

HB 436, filed on 12th January, seeks to add a formal definition for ""virtual currency"" to the state’s laws, as well as create an exception from money transmission requirements for ""persons conducting business using transactions conducted in whole or in part in virtual currency"". The bill would also add a clause to the definition of a digital currency money transmitter, a designation which, if passed, would include ""maintaining control of virtual currency on behalf of others"". That said, the proposal isn't exactly cut-and-dry. The bill does not specify which kinds of ""business"" would be covered, potentially leaving a gap within which sellers might fall. The measure appears to be a response to state regulation, which became official last year, that made it so bitcoin sellers in the state are considered money transmitters, requiring them to be licensed and bonded as a result. The bill goes on to add a definition for ""virtual currency"", which reads: The bill is sponsored by Representative Barbara Biggie, with Representative Keith Ammon as co-sponsor. The first hearing on the bill has already been held, a recording of which can be found here. The next hearing, before the New Hampshire House Commerce and Consumer Affairs Committee, is set to take place tomorrow. Notably, HB 436 isn’t the first time legislators in NH have considered bills related to bitcoin. In 2015, a proposal was put forward to allow residents to pay their tax bills with bitcoin. That measure was later scuttled, but supporters at the time said they planned to re-file the bill. Image via Shutterstock

                            Construct 2017: Life After SegWit? Bitcoin Gridlock Takes the Stage                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/construct-2017-life-segwit-bitcoins-tech-gridlock-takes-spotlight/,"""It's contingent upon SegWit."" Lightning Labs developer Joseph Poon is talking about bitcoin's Lightning Network, the top-layer network that could potentially boost bitcoin's transaction capacity to millions of transactions per second, but the same can be said of most of the other technical improvements for the network presented at Construct 2017, CoinDesk's inaugural San Francisco developer conference. In many presentations, it seemed as if moving forward with the project, a more than $15bn economic network that sprang from only open-source code, is wholly dependent on SegWit. The problem, of course, is that (for a complex set of technical and political reasons) it might not activate, a factor that continues to put stress on its development team. Politecnico di Milano professor Ferdinando M Ametrano told CoinDesk: Murmurings from other attendees seemed to bolster this view, but any action still seems far. As of Tuesday, one new mining pool is flagging support for the change. If it continues to do so, this will bring support for the upgrade up to 30% or 31%. Still, it's short of the required threshold of 95% necessary for activation.  One of the best-known benefits is Lightning Network. SegWit moves around transaction data in such a way that it solves a problem known as ""transaction malleability,"" which makes transactions using the top-layer network more secure and user-friendly. ""You can kind of make it work without SegWit. The problem is that it sucks,"" Poon explained in his presentation. Elsewhere, others made a similar argument. The most obvious presentation to dive into examples was Bitcoin Core developer Eric Lombrozo's presentation on SegWit, where he called it ""the most exciting thing"" he's worked on so far as a bitcoin developer. He mentioned that it can help enable more advanced scripting, meaning that bitcoin users can lock up their funds in other new ways, and that it would enable different signature schemes, such as Schnorr signatures or even signatures that are resistant to quantum computers. And, other attendees were quick to point out other pieces. ""I think that more technical issues might be lost, like that signature validation will become linear rather than quadratic,"" Ametrano said. In conversation, Lightning Labs developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun further noted how it makes transactions safer for users of hardware wallets. Although most of bitcoin’s active developers support the change, some still believe it's proven contentious. Drew Rasmussen, CTO of OTCXN, a startup looking to apply blockchain to the forex market, talked about it more from the frame of reference of a bitcoin outsider who's been more focused in the enterprise blockchain work. ""I think it would be something good to implement,"" he said, though he acknowledged that the community's skepticism of changes could be what's holding it back. So, what happens if it doesn’t activate? Despite the seeming urgency around the change, Bitcoin Core contributor Cory Fields, who also works at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative, said he doesn't yet believe he's heard a compelling argument for why it shouldn't be activated. It seems the alternatives aren't yet clear. ""SegWit is such a clear and obvious win. I've yet to hear a downside argument to it,"" he told attendees. He framed the issue as one of politics, not technology. There's no way to tell the future, but it's notable that when asked the same question, attendees seemed to take an optimistic view of the situation. Osuntokun mentioned that Lightning has a backup plan if SegWit doesn’t activate. But, in the mean time, since SegWit offers a better network, they’re operating under the assumption that it will trigger. ""If it's the best design, it makes sense to go toward that,"" he said. Ametrano echoed the growing opinion that bitcoin is slow to change, and that that's actually a good thing. ""I think it’s a win-win situation for bitcoin, because if SegWit is accepted, and I think it should be because it’s moving bitcoin’s technical boundary forward, this will improve bitcoin a lot. But if it is not approved, this will demonstrate that bitcoin cannot be manipulated or managed, not even by Bitcoin Core,"" he said. Osuntokun was similarly positive in remarks, guessing that SegWit would activate in March. When asked why, he shrugged and said only: Images via Cryptograffiti and Pete Rizzo

                            Bitcoin Price Breaks Sleepy Spell to Jump Above $950                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-jumps-950/,"   Bitcoin prices are up more than 3% since the start of the day’s trading, climbing above $950 for the first time in weeks. The average price hit a high of $959.37 from an open of $920.24, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). BPI data shows that the price of bitcoin hasn’t exceed $950 since 6th January. The rise above $950 came after several days of relatively stable trading, in which the price of bitcoin ranged between roughly $910 and $922, according to trading data. At press time, the average price of bitcoin is $956.32. CNY-denominated markets have climbed nearly 11%, hitting a press time high of ¥6,629.34. The current price of ¥6,608.70 represents a rise of roughly 10.7% above today’s UTC open of ¥5,961.77. The move comes amid a shift in the global exchange landscape, which has seen its lines redrawn after major bourses in China moved to add trading fees. As a result, volume has shifted – at least for now – toward no-fee markets. Observers, however, argue that this trend will be short-lived as those exchanges look to add fees of their own.

                            Bitcoin Lightning Network Creator Joins MIT Digital Currency Effort                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-lightning-creator-mit-digital-currency-initiative/,"Tadge Dryja, one of two authors behind the white paper that spawned bitcoin's much-anticipated Lightning payment network, has officially joined MIT's Digital Currency Initiative. Dryja will now work full-time at the famed technical university's cryptocurrency and blockchain research effort – a division of its larger MIT Media Lab – where he will serve as a research scientist. (The MIT DCI also funds core bitcoin developers as part of a separate program under its management.) In interview with CoinDesk, MIT DCI director of research Neha Narula credited the hiring to the caliber of Dryja's work, as well as his desire to focus further on research efforts. Narula told CoinDesk: Dryja is now working out of MIT's main office in Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he said he's active in educating undergraduates on digital currencies and fostering their interest in the technology. The move also marks a change in direction for Dryja who had formerly served at one-time bitcoin exchange startup Mirror and as a founder of Lightning Labs, a for-profit startup seeking to develop the open-source Bitcoin Lightning Network. Dryja indicated that business differences lead him to consider other avenues for his work, as did his belief that it's still too early to monetize many blockchain technology efforts. ""There are places for for-profit things, but a lot of this is at the point where this is research. It's so early,"" he said. Dryja said he is continuing to work on the Lightning Network, which has advanced since its 2015 proposal and is now being actively developed by a handful of global bitcoin startups and developer groups. An early version of the technology, which would use the bitcoin network as a base for more robust transaction processing, debuted earlier this month. Dryja image via Vimeo

                            The Battle For Bitcoin's Shifting Exchange Volumes is Escalating                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/battle-bitcoins-shifting-exchange-volumes-escalating/," Bitcoin traders have long been skeptical of the reliability of available exchange data – but that uncertainty has been on the rise in recent days. To recap, up until recently, China-based exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin dominated the landscape in terms of volume (though these figures were long observed with skepticism). However, this reign was cut short earlier in January when the startups came under the scrutiny of the People's Bank of China (PBOC), the country's central bank. The result has been a series of policy changes, the abrupt end to popular trading features like margin trading and a rapid decline in the volume at the three exchanges, developments that are now impacting the wider market. In recent days, new no-fee exchanges are now ranking among the top 10 in volume, resulting in a bitcoin exchange leaderboard that looks markedly different than it did last week. At first, no-fee exchanges such as BTC100 and CHBTC moved to the front of the pack in terms of trading volume, but this, too, is now shifting. As of today, BTC100, a no-fee exchange, held the top spot with roughly 32,600 BTC worth of trading volume during the 24 hours through roughly 22:00 UTC, CoinMarketCap data shows. XBTCe and Poloniex, which both charge trading fees, held second and third place with more than 17,100 BTC and less than 17,100 BTC, respectively. But while there is a fair amount of market confusion, what the takeaway might be is that the PBOC has effectively created new opportunities for smaller operations to compete by pushing for changes only for certain market participants. Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, spoke to these recent developments, and drew a similar conclusion. ""Since liquidity is king for exchanges, and liquidity begets liquidity, the decrease in trading volumes on Chinese exchanges has opened up the market for exchanges around the world to stake a claim as one of the most liquid exchanges in the world,"" he told CoinDesk. Burniske further commented on how he expects some exchanges to take advantage of the situation by cutting prices. London-based Coinfloor, for example, is one such exchange that has already slashed fees since the PBOC's actions first began. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, offered a similar view on how marketplaces may respond to the situation. ""Many exchanges may be using this as a marketing opportunity: by offering zero fees and pumping their volumes up, they appear at the top of the charts,"" he told CoinDesk. As of now, there are signs the exchanges themselves are aware of the current environment, signaling further updates could be ahead. BTCTrade co-founder and CEO Zhang Shousong, for example, acknowledged that his China-based exchange has seen new volumes because it has yet to increase fees for users, though he said that he has been in talks with other major exchanges about its policies. He said the exchange is considering following the lead of the other exchanges, in part, because their heightened volumes were what drew scrutiny from regulators. ""We all want to reduce the heat of China's bitcoin trading,"" he said. When asked if BTCTrade could move to alter its fees, Zhang told CoinDesk: Medieval weaponry via Shutterstock

The Fed’s Office of the Inspector General said today that Nicholas Berthaume, who previously worked as a communications analyst for the board before being fired in light of the incident, had been placed on 12 months of probation after accepting a plea deal on 27th January. He plead guilty to one count of unlawful conversion of government property, a misdemeanor. Court documents show that Berthaume, who was indicted last October, had mined bitcoins using a Fed server for more than two years, from March 2012 to June 2014. Bitcoin mining is an energy intensive and competitive process by which new transactions are added to the blockchain. In a statement, Fed board inspector general Mark Bialek said that his office had not been able to determine the amount of bitcoins earned. He also explained that Berthaume had sought to hide the fact that he was mining as it became apparent to Fed investigators. Bialek noted: While he did not offer any details, Bialek added that staff for the Fed board had put in place security measures to prevent similar occurrences from taking place.

Of those, Greycroft is a new investor in the startup. The announcement comes just under two years after BitPesa, which operates in markets like Nigeria, Kenya and Uganda, among others, raised $1.1m in a round led by Pantera Capital. Last year, BitPesa received an investment from The BitFury Group. Plans for the year ahead include continuing to focus on customer growth and outreach, with a focus on Nigeria, the startup’s largest market. Founder and CEO Elizabeth Rossiello said in a statement: In statements, those backing the firm, including existing investor Tim Draper, highlighted BitPesa’s local approach to growth. “It takes a locally-based team to work in the evolving landscape of frontier market financial services, and BitPesa's approach to investing in teams, infrastructure, and compliance from Lagos to London gives them a strong advantage,” Draper said.

                            Change in China (And What It Means For Bitcoin)                        ",Noelle Acheson,https://www.coindesk.com/change-china-means-bitcoin/,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  The financial world saw history made last week when, for the first time ever, a Chinese head of state took the podium at the World Economic Forum's famed Davos conference in Switzerland. Issued on 17th January, Xi Jinping's speech has since been interpreted as a response to rising protectionism – and an attempt to consolidate China’s position on the world stage. But, it's worth examining in another light. It is also likely to be indicative of the path Chinese authorities will take regarding the country's bitcoin exchanges. While we've been focusing on the central bank's scrutiny (and its potential impact on bitcoin's network and price), this view masks the bigger picture. First, a bit of background. Over the past weeks, we’ve seen clear evidence of China's weight in global bitcoin markets. News of meetings between the People's Bank of China (PBoC) and leading exchanges sent prices tumbling. The subsequent suspension of margin lending and the introduction of trading fees had dramatic effects on volumes, and many feared that the resulting dent in Chinese demand would dampen price growth. Some interpreted the moves as an impending crackdown on bitcoin. China needs to stem capital outflows, the reasoning went, and since bitcoin is an attractive vehicle for that, it needs to be stopped. On the surface, this might make sense. Traditionally, the US has been the world’s champion of free trade while China has dragged its feet. But now, the tables seem to be turning, China appears eager to position itself as a 'modern' economy with a flourishing FinTech ecosystem. Part of that is seen in its interest in blockchain technology. Earlier this week, local news sources reported that the PBoC had tested a blockchain-based digital currency and is establishing a related research institute. Furthermore, banks, startups, academia and consortia are working with international institutions to foster a bustling blockchain environment. While interest in permissioned ledgers is not the same as support for digitized assets like bitcoin, a desire to participate in foundational change bodes well for the acceptance of alternatives. And an understanding of how the technology works should prevent impractical measures. (The PBoC has not, to our knowledge, indicated an interest in banning bitcoin, nor is it likely to). Most pronouncements have expressed a cautious interest, and trading restrictions are less an indictment than they are part of the central bank’s job. Capital outflows, on the other hand, are a concern, but local experts downplay the threat to monetary policy. While most of the world’s bitcoin mining and trading takes place in China, the cryptocurrency’s market capitalization is minute compared to the overall size of the Chinese economy. More broadly, the recent interest in bitcoin exchanges could well be part of a larger attempt to deflate asset bubbles. This week, the PBoC asked banks to curb lending, ahead of what is traditionally the strongest quarter for growth in loans. The request stressed the importance of reducing mortgage allocations, with the hope of curtailing runaway real estate prices. The central bank also raised interest rates for the first time in years, which some analysts interpreted as part of its objective to curtail speculation. While the bitcoin-related moves do seem to inch towards regulation, few believe that would be bad for the sector. Most appear to focus on the legitimacy it would bestow and the confidence it would give the ecosystem. Looking ahead, political and economic troubles could complicate things. The possibility of a trade war or even a military conflict in the South China Sea could send the exchange rate lower, drive the BTC price higher and put increasing pressure on China's government to appear strong, especially in the run-up to its 19th party conference later this year. Yet, as China heads into its week-long holiday for the Lunar New Year, the approach seems to be one of dialogue and further investigation. In his Davos speech, President Xi quoted a Chinese proverb: This not only is a fitting metaphor for China’s internal conflict between wanting to participate in (or even lead) global progress and at the same time keep things calm at home, it also seems to sum up bitcoin’s struggles to become an accepted medium of exchange in a world of shifting priorities. And it should reassure us that, in China, bitcoin is not a target. Click Here to Never Miss a Weekly Email Again China passport image via Shutterstock

                            Rethinking Proof of Work: The Quest to 'Improve' Bitcoin Heats Up                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/rethinking-proof-of-work-the-quest-to-improve-bitcoin-heats-up/," In a world barreling onward in the name of efficiency, bitcoin stands out for the purposeful way it's anything but. This 'deficiency' was the focus of many talks at day two of Stanford’s security conference, Blockchain Protocol Analysis and Security Engineering 2017, this week. For all its benefits, the system that secures bitcoin, proof of work (PoW), is estimated to require as much electricity as all of Denmark by 2020, and many researchers see this as a prize problem to solve. But, the bad news is that, so far, it's proven difficult to find an alternative that provides as much security as bitcoin's massive collection of global computers, all brute-forcing the network in an effort to win its rewards. At least, no alternative of has been successfully deployed on a large scale. Nonetheless, the race to invent a blockchain security system that's less resource intensive, and that could still thwart double spending in open blockchain networks, continues, and attendees see the experimentation as a good sign. Founder and CEO of Protocol Labs Juan Benet perhaps best summed up the sentiment that something else will eventually be discovered if enough bright minds attack the idea from all angles. Benet told CoinDesk: Perhaps the more experimental ideas presented were 'proof-of-space' and 'proof-of-time', described by BitTorrent creator Bram Cohen. The idea is to rely on proof that you have space, (such as free hard-drive space on your laptop, for example) and conventional time, which he believes could serve as more democratic resources that could help decentralized economic systems prove ownership. The idea is in the early stages, and Cohen walked through a lot of variations of the proposal, each with some unsolved problems, or ways it can be attacked. It’s all theoretical right now, and there isn’t any code. Again, the reasoning behind the proposals is that it could serve as an energy-efficient alternative to proof of work. ""Blockchains fundamentally require waste,"" Cohen said. Elsewhere, ethereum developer Vlad Zamfir gave an update on Casper, the proof-of-stake protocol that ethereum plans to one day switch to, and that aims to replace its existing proof-of-work protocol. Still, his talk provided a window into the game theoretic challenges that the ethereum team is still struggling against as it strives to ensure the right balance between competition and cooperation in its network. Yet, despite experimentation with new protocols, others are taking a step back. Cornell associate professor Elaine Shi's research, for example, has focused on gaining a deeper understanding of why PoW actually works so well. ""The protocol's success is ahead of the scientific understanding,"" she said. Although it works and there has been some progress in understanding the security benefits, she believes right now people often rely on intuition to describe why it works. She noted, as others did, that ""the biggest elephant is power consumption"". But, she also mentioned that throughput is relatively low, and that there might be other downsides. Maybe a more formal understanding of how bitcoin works would make it easier to understand if another consensus protocol could take its place. ""It would be interesting to understand, are some of these constraints inherent or are there ways to do better? It would be great to understand theoretically what is possible and what is not possible,"" she said. Still, not everyone believes that the work to rethink proof of work is advancing enough to offer a viable alternative. ETH Zürich PhD student Arthur Gervais noted that most of the proposals are quite theoretical right now, and that it won’t be possible to know how successful they might be until there are deeper specifications to facilitate better analyses. Still, Benet believes that this is only a matter of time and study. ""There’s a lot of belief in proof-of-work that is more based on agreement rather than rational, proof-oriented understanding,"" he said. He noted, for example, that miners will have an incentive to push for the continued use of proof-of-work, given that the business of collecting rewards in blockchain-based systems is still lucrative. Ultimately, he concluded: Featured bitcoin image via Shutterstock

                            Review: Putting Ledger's New Bitcoin Hardware to the Test                        ",Jameson Lopp,https://www.coindesk.com/review-putting-ledgers-newest-bitcoin-hardware-test/,"Jameson Lopp is a software engineer at BitGo, creator of statoshi.info and founder of bitcoinsig.com. In this guest review, Lopp puts the recently released Ledger Blue hardware cryptocurrency wallet through its paces to see if its high price is matched by its utility.  Name: Ledger Blue What it is: A handheld cryptocurrency hardware wallet device architected around a secure element, featuring a touchscreen and USB/NFC/BLE connectivity for PC and smartphone compatibility. It runs multiple apps such as bitcoin, ethereum, FIDO U2F, SSH, and GPG, and can be used with a number of digital currencies including bitcoin, dash, Zcash, litecoin and dogecoin. Who’s behind it: Ledger, a French startup that builds personal security devices for end users, hardware security modules for servers, and hardware oracles for the IoT. Cost: €229 + shipping Date launched: December 2016 Summary: The Ledger Blue is the next step in the evolution of cryptocurrency hardware wallets. It combines high-end security with ease of use. The biggest downside for early adopters is that the full capabilities of the device are not yet available. Where to buy: Directly from Ledger
 At €229, the Ledger Blue is the most expensive bitcoin hardware security device on the market. The last time I paid this much for a hardware wallet ($200 for a Case Wallet), I was mostly disappointed. Let’s dig into the details to see if the Blue’s utility matches its price. The Blue comes with an impressive array of cryptographic and security features that you can read about in their announcement article and on the product page itself. Since most of them are honestly outside the range of my expertise to test, I won’t be performing a hardware teardown or deep technical dive because it wouldn’t be particularly informative. I’m confident in the security functionality offered by Ledger and will instead focus on user experience for this review. When I received my Blue, it arrived well packaged with tamper-evident tape along all edges.   Upon opening the shrink-wrapped box, you’ll find a note that mentions that the device doesn’t actually need tamper-evident seals.  Turning on the device for the first time and configuring it was a breeze.   I generated my backup seed phrase, wrote it down, confirmed that I had it written down, and the Blue was ready to use!  Inside the box, a note directs you to Ledger's site for configuration instructions. Ledger has also released a series of tutorial videos that make it very straightforward to learn how to set up and use the device. While I personally did not find the need to make use of these resources, I'm sure plenty of users will appreciate them. I decided to use my Blue to test BitGo’s Ledger integration that we were developing and have just released. You can read more about how to use the Ledger Blue or Ledger Nano S with BitGo in this guide.  The Blue works well with BitGo’s web client, though there is one outstanding issue that Ledger needs to fix with their bitcoin app in order to better support P2SH transactions. At the moment, the transaction details are not displayed on the device, which only displays 'P2SH'. Ledger said it expects to release a new app to fix this in the next few weeks.
 The Ledger Blue is a lightweight device, the size of a small smartphone. At a mere 90g, it’s only half the heft of my Nexus 6. With the Blue, there is almost no risk to the user in case of device theft or loss. An attacker will find the device rendered unusable after three failed login attempts, while a lost device can simply be replaced and a new one reinitialized from the 24-word seed phrase.  The large touchscreen that supports a QWERTY keyboard for input is superior to the Ledger Nano S’s two buttons, which can be a pain to click many times while navigating around the device. Incidentally, if you’re setting up a Ledger hardware device that doesn’t have a screen, such as the HW.1 or Nano, you should go through the hassle of setting up a secure computer to generate the seed – this is unnecessary with the Nano S and Ledger Blue. Along a similar vein, Ledger devices without screens could potentially be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks if used with a compromised computer and thus require an additional layer of security that requires the user to either pair the device with a smartphone or enter a code from a separate security card – an added inconvenience. Ledger says the Blue has a “strong and durable casing, anti-scratch glass”, though I was slightly worried about screen scratches. Upon receiving my Ledger Blue, I threw it in my laptop satchel with lots of other loose electronics and took a weeklong trip from America to Europe. Thus far, the Blue’s screen hasn’t taken any visible damage. I tested the device's battery life by turning the auto-sleep settings to the maximum period and leaving the device powered on at the default 75% screen brightness, waking it every time the screen turned off. The device lasted for over three hours continuously, which ought to allow you to make quite a few transactions between charges. When writing down the 24-word seed phrase while initializing the device, it’s a slight annoyance (and potential cause of user error) that the entries on the provided card alternate left and right while on screen they are listed top to bottom. Also, the default screen timeout is 30 seconds and you find yourself having to turn it back on every time you want to display the next page of recovery words. I was surprised when the confirmation at the end only checks two random words – I would feel more comfortable if it checked that I correctly wrote down all 24. 
Another minor annoyance is that when pressing the power button to turn on the device, the screen flickers, which was slightly disconcerting at first because I thought something was wrong. In order to actually turn on the Blue, you must hold down the power button for three seconds – ignore the initial screen flash. You can see on this YouTube video that Kenneth Bosak experienced the same flicker with his early batch Blue. Ledger tells me that this issue has since been fixed. My replacement did not have the flicker at first, though several weeks later I noticed that it also started experiencing the flicker upon pressing the power button. Ledger has several nice wallets that are Chrome apps, though anyone who intends to use these should be aware that Google is discontinuing Chrome App support in 2018. Ledger says it's already working on a replacement platform – details of which are still not announced. It also wasn’t clear to me how to set the 'plausible deniability' alternate PIN that was touted in this blog post. Upon reaching out to Ledger, I was told that the Blue currently only supports the passphrase option using the same setup method as the Nano S which uses Python scripts. Unfortunately there is a bug in setting the alternate PIN, so right now it can be used only with a dynamic passphrase. They hope to fix this with a firmware update in Q1 2017. In my opinion, this is one of the few areas where Ledger could improve the usability of the device, by enabling users to activate this feature either on the device or via a management app. I also wanted to test the Ledger Blue against a Mycelium wallet on my phone, but I wasn’t aware that I’d need an OTG adapter to do so. I was hoping I’d be able to add it wirelessly because the Blue has bluetooth support, but it appears that Mycelium hasn’t added it yet. The Blue also has the capability to support NFC, but the current version of firmware doesn’t support it. After contacting Ledger about this feature, they responded that they are planning to release the NFC firmware update around the end of Q2 2017. Since I ended up with some downtime while waiting to receive a replacement Blue (see below for why I needed one), I bought this OTG adapter from Amazon and later successfully tested that the Blue works with Mycelium in this configuration. On a related note, a quirk I noticed (that only developers will care about) is that when using the Ledger Blue on testnet, it still displays mainnet addresses on the device for confirmation. Ledger told me the address format bug is expected – they need to build a bitcoin app compiled for testnet on the device to support it. The testnet bitcoin app is not yet offered in the Ledger app manager. 
I then decided to also test GreenAddress’ GreenBits mobile wallet to see how it fared. One thing I noticed off the bat was that there’s no point opening GreenBits without the Blue connected – it would just load my default wallet. Instead, upon connecting the Blue and entering my PIN, my Android phone would prompt me to “Login” with the Blue, at which point GreenBits would open my Ledger-based wallet. 
The wallet worked fine for sending, though since GreenAddress is a 2-of-2 multisignature wallet, the P2SH display issue also presented itself as it did with BitGo’s wallet. I later realized that since there is no way to open a GreenBits Ledger wallet without the device present, this means that it’s not possible to receive transactions to your wallet without the Blue plugged in and unlocked. It turns out the solution to this to create a watch-only login while you have the Ledger Blue wallet open. You can set up a watch-only login by going to Settings => Info & Settings => Watch only login. 
After showcasing the Blue to some of the members at my local bitcoin meetup group, they asked me if I thought it was robust against everyday wear and tear. My Blue had already been subjected to rattling around inside my laptop bag for several weeks, so we decided to perform a simple drop test. I dropped it (face up) from a height of less than six inches onto a nearby table. Upon picking up the device and trying to turn it on, I noticed that the power button was missing and when I shook the Blue there was a rattle that was clearly the power button. My Blue was now perfectly secure – even I was unable to access its contents! I sent an email to Ledger support and they promptly responded, noting that it was a known build-quality issue and they were replacing the first batch of units. One week later, I had my replacement in hand, along with an assurance that the assembly process for the button had been modified so it doesn't get dislodged. I've performed the same drop test upon the replacement several times and it's undamaged.  Upon powering up my replacement unit, I immediately noticed that it emits an extremely high pitch whine reminiscent of some older TVs and CRT monitors. I found this to be odd given that the first Blue didn’t make any sounds. After contacting Ledger, they explained that this comes from an inductance that vibrates at a frequency audible by human ears and it’s a known issue that will be fixed with a firmware update. As you can see, the Blue has a number of minor software and hardware issues that need to be worked out. I expect that they’ll all be rectified in time to be applied to the next batch produced. The closest competitors for this level of hardware security and usability are TREZOR, KeepKey, and Ledger’s own Nano S. They all seem to have good reviews and you probably can’t go wrong by using any of them. While I ran into some quality issues, this is somewhat to be expected with a first run of completely new hardware. I see no reason for users to be concerned about hardware issues because I received excellent support and Ledger’s CEO, Eric Larchevêque, told me via email: The Ledger Blue is by far the most user-friendly Ledger product I’ve used. In comparison to the HW.1, Nano, and Nano S, the Blue is more versatile and easy to use. If you’re a technical user or early adopter of new technology then it should be fine for you to buy a Blue today. If you’re less technical and want a more battle-tested and full-featured product, you may want to wait a few months for the hardware and software kinks to be ironed out.

                            Bitcoin Volume is On the Move to New No-Fee Exchanges                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-volume-move-traders-embrace-no-fee-exchanges/," Bitcoin trading volume is shifting to new exchanges, data shows. Following the decision by major China-based exchanges to end the practice of no-fee trading (at the request of the country's central bank), their lesser-known competitors have begun to claim the top spots in terms of transaction activity. In the aftermath of the big exchanges adding trading fees – BTC100 and CHBTC – two China-based marketplaces, have climbed to the number one and number two spots in trading volume, according to CoinMarketCap figures and the companies' websites. BTC100, which came out on top, enjoyed more than 36,000 BTC in volume over the last 24 hours, and CHBTC, the runner up, saw roughly 29,000 BTC of transaction activity in this time. This screenshot shows the volume that these two exchanges commanded at the time:  In contrast, Poloniex, Bitfinex and BTCC, the three largest fee-charging exchanges when ranked by no-fee trading volume, saw more than 20,000 BTC, 9,000 BTC and 8,000 BTC, respectively, during that period. While it might be too early to draw conclusions, it does seem that traders are beginning to consider alternatives to BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, exchanges formerly known as China's 'Big Three' for their commanding volumes. So far, we know the transaction volume on all three exchanges has continued to track lower over the last few sessions amid reports that traders are moving elsewhere. Zhou Shouji, the operator of bitcoin hedge fund and incubator FinTech Blockchain Group, said he has already seen traders adopt CHBTC and rival firm BTCTrade to sidestep fees. BTCTrade saw volumes of 12,333 BTC in the past 24 hours, less than reported by CHBTC and BTC100, but higher than major international firms. Asked if traders were on the move, Shouji responded: Still, it remains uncertain just how many traders are switching, and unlikely that most of this volume represents 'real-world trading' given how the 'Big Three' responded to the news. Seeing as how both BTC100 and CHBTC have refrained from charging fees (even after BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin opted to implement such a policy), any market observer would question how much longer this disparity will continue. Analysts predicted that the exchanges will probably draw the interest of the People's Bank of China, which would likely prompt these marketplaces to begin imposing trading fees of their own. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Asset Management, described such a chain of events as inevitable. ""It's the price of success,"" he said. A similar view was articulated by Adamant Research director Tuur Demeester. As long as Chinese government authorities can locate the exchanges, they'll soon get a visit from regulators, he predicted. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, also forecast that Chinese exchanges which have been generating robust trading volume will likely adopt such fees. ""All Chinese exchanges that want a viable business medium long-term will follow the lead of the 'Big Three',"" he said, adding: Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

                            Watch Washington's Senate Debate If Buying Weed With Bitcoin is Bad                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/watch-washington-senate-debate-weed-bitcoin/," Legislators gathered on Wednesday afternoon to hold a public hearing on a measure that would prohibit cannabis firms in the state of Washington from working with bitcoin. CoinDesk reported last week that SB 5264, a bill presented by two Washington state senators, would ban businesses working in the marijuana industry from both selling products for bitcoin as well as purchasing them with the digital currency. At the time, primary sponsor Sen. Ann Rivers said that the measure was intended to boost financial transparency to the state’s cannabis sector as part of an effort to “help move it out of the shadows”. The move sparked headlines and at least one petition aimed at stopping the measure in its tracks. Yet before the bill can become law, it has to move through the legislature, setting the stage for events like Wednesday’s hearing before the Washington Senate Commerce, Labor & Sports Committee. The hearing drew a mixture of support and opposition for the bill, during which lawmakers asked a number of questions about the tech. Also appearing were representatives for the Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board, which has called for businesses in the state to shift toward electronic payments. Among those speaking against the measure were representatives from Posabit, a bitcoin point-of-sale developer based in Seattle. In remarks, co-founder and CEO Ryan Hamlin spoke about the concerns among cannabis business owners who face the risk of robbery – a trend in the US affecting marijuana shops that rely on cash because they’re effectively locked out of the banking system owing to the nature of their business. Hamlin told committee members: Hamlin reiterated the focus on store owner safety, arguing that ""we are removing cash from the system which is helping our customers become safer"". Yet another payments company servicing marijuana firms in the industry expressed strong support for the bill. PayQwick offers payment services to businesses and consumers in the space, as well as cash handling services. Kenneth Burke, the firm’s CEO, invoked the newly-minted Trump administration and the as-yet-unconfirmed US Attorney General nominee, Sen. Jeff Sessions in his statements. Sessions, who according to Politico has called marijuana legal reform a ""tragic mistake"", is likely to enforce the federal ban on marijuana more decidedly than the Obama administration. ""I think allowing bitcoin in consumer transactions in Washington is just going to invite extra scrutiny from Sessions and the federal government,"" Burke told the panel. One point of contention during the hearings was the question of whether bitcoin transactions are traceable. Among those was Burke, who argued that ""with bitcoin, there’s just no traceability to it"". But on the contrary, every bitcoin transaction is published to the public blockchain. Instead of being attached to a particular identity though, bitcoins are attributed to pseudonymous addresses. Actual identification of a user happens outside of the bitcoin system itself, as in the case of an exchange conducting a know-your-customer process. Joseph Cutler, a partner for the law firm Perkins Coie who is based in the Seattle area, disputed the notion that bitcoin transactions can’t be traced. “This idea that it’s untraceable is simply false. People also say bitcoin is anonymous,” he told the panel. “This is also false. We like to call it pseudonymous, which is better than cash.” Cutler went on to invoke once again the problematic use of cash in cannabis businesses. “In the marijuana space, for example, cash is king,” he said, adding: A video of the hearing can be found below: !(function(src,cb){var s=document.createElement('script');s.src=src;s.async=true;if(s.readyState){s.onreadystatechange=function(){if(s.readyState=='loaded'||s.readyState=='complete'){s.onreadystatechange=null;cb();}};}else{s.onload=function(){cb();};}document.getElementsByTagName('head')[0].appendChild(s);})('//mediaplayer.invintusmedia.com/app.js',function(){Invintus.launch({""clientID"":""9375922947"",""eventID"":""2017011321""});}); Image via TVW

                            Bitcoin's Volume is Continuing to Decline at Major Exchanges                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-volume-continuing-decline-major-exchanges/," Bitcoin trading volume continued to slide on 26th January, as market sentiment showed signs it has yet to fully brush off the impact of new policies at major China-based exchanges. Overall trading volume has declined substantially in the days since OKCoin, BTCC and Huobi began charging trading fees on 24th January, and there are signs that these exchanges are acknowledging what could be a continued issue. Xu Qing, a spokesperson for Huobi, noted how these developments are impacting his exchange, telling CoinDesk: ""The trading volume started plunging since we started charging trading fees."" In the face of this, sentiment is ""bruised,"" according to Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for over-the-counter trading desk Richfund. He went so far as to claim that some market participants are beginning to look to other assets for improved returns, stating: In spite of this lackluster sentiment and falling volumes, however, bitcoin prices did manage to notch some modest gains today, rising as much as 2.8% to $919.13. The digital currency was slightly lower at $918 at the time of report. While volumes were expected to decline on the first day of the change, what's notable is that this downtrend is showing no signs of stopping, data reveals. Market participants traded only 10,100 BTC through OKCoin, the leader in volumes in the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC on 26th January, Bitcoinity data shows. This figure represents a mere fraction of the daily average of 23,000 BTC that the digital currency exchange saw over the last seven days. In addition, it represented a sharp decline when compared to trading volume over the last few days. OKCoin’s 26th January figure, for example, was close to 30% lower than the 25th January figure of 13,900 BTC, and upwards of 90% below the 24th January total of 82,000 BTC, according to additional Bitcoinity data. The chart below shows the declining transaction activity this exchange experienced over the last few days:  BTCC, the runner up in terms of market volume, encountered a similar situation, seeing only 7,100 BTC worth of trades during the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC on 26th January. Today's session fell far short of the average daily volume of 160,000 that the exchange has enjoyed over the last week. The graph below shows the sharp falloff that BTCC trading volume has seen:  Even outside of China, Bitfinex, which is now in third place in terms of volume, also saw a notable decline in activity. Market participants traded only 7,000 BTC through the exchange during the 24 hours through 22:00 UTC. This figure was more than 30% lower than the average over the last seven days, Bitcoinity data reveals.  But while Bitfinex has seen a decline in volume over the last few sessions, its drop has been far less severe than the decrease suffered by the major Chinese exchanges. Bitfinex has not updated its policies in recent weeks. Analysts indicated that the decline may have been bigger than expected, a concern that is also contributing to depressed sentiment. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, spoke to this situation: ""This has surprised many in the industry as the ‘real’ demand for bitcoin trading in China is much lower than what people expected,"" he said. Yet, while several analysts emphasized the key role played by market sentiment, some pointed to the calendar as the chief contributor for the slump. The Chinese New Year is only a few days away, noted Arthur Hayes, and as a result, ""volumes are declining rapidly."" He added: Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund, voiced his doubts about this explanation, stating that while the Chinese New Year may be driving the recent decline in volume, he is ""doubtful"" this holiday is to blame. Instead, he emphasized the lack of new macro events, which might otherwise prompt market participants to trade bitcoin.

The Switzerland-based company said in a new blog post that it has been given “conditional approval” from the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA) to do business in the European country. The approval isn’t final, however, as Xapo said the regulator wants to see it join a self-regulatory organization (SRO), among other steps. Xapo relocated to Switzerland in mid-2015, citing customer privacy concerns at the time as it looked to shift away from its operations in Palo Alto, California. In the blog, CEO Wences Casares wrote that the company is “optimistic that we will meet the required conditions”. Casares went on to write: The development represents the latest positive sign out of Switzerland for companies looking to work with the tech. The past several months have seen a major Swiss rail operator offer bitcoin buying services through its ticket kiosks and one of the country’s telecoms join the Hyperledger blockchain project. As well, Swiss regulators continue to push for the development of a more open environment in a bid to attract startups. Xapo was not immediately available for comment when reached.

On the sidelines of the two-day Satoshi Roundtable conference in Cancun, rumors were swirling that new developments in the 'Who is Satoshi?' story once again relate to the controversial Australian academic and entrepreneur Craig Wright, who last May claimed that he – and as many as four others – contributed to the white paper credited to bitcoin's pseudonymous inventor. This time, however, there is said to be a potential twist to the story relating to an unknown entity that may have a claim to the intellectual property created by that group. Major news outlets are once again said to be conducting an investigation into the story, with releases coming out as early as next month. While interesting, the speculation is notable given that Wright's claims were later attacked by cryptographers, with even those who initially vouched on his behalf later attempting to distance themselves from their previous support. Wright later publicly apologized for what he claimed is his inability to provide more proof defending his claims, stating at the time: Image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk

You shouldn't be able to all come to Cancun and make a decision that changes the entire game."" Faced with a stalemate on critical issues, day two of Satoshi Roundtable saw a notable decline in participation, as the number of attendees tapered off gradually at the 'unconference' famed for its invite-only status and secretive public presence. Whereas day one featured well-attended sessions on a range of issues, day two saw relatively fewer guests attempt to both break new ground on some of the larger issues facing the $14.5bn network and regroup around its core values. Faced with frustrations about the lack of diversity in participants (not present this year were many major miners and business executives), early conversation mostly served to galvanize users and technologists around common goals, such as how cryptography could be used to protect personal freedoms and remove power from governments and institutions. Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen framed the conversation as a return to basics, one that also united a notable number of visible industry participants in an environment that was perhaps more suitable to civil conversation. Allen told CoinDesk: Still, in the day's earlier sessions, older tensions seemed to flare as past debates resurfaced. For example, there remains a division among the technology's supporters and entrepreneurs on how to evaluate the developments on ethereum, an alternative blockchain for smart contracts that experienced a controversial split last year. Elsewhere, there remained an advocacy among developers for prioritizing ways to keep the core bitcoin software unchanged, despite pressures for more aggressive problem solving. ""I think the philosophy of bitcoin people has been, bitcoin is much like the Internet. How many people would say the Internet hasn't innovated? When you look at the protocol, it hasn't innovated much at all. We do it in layers,"" another attendee said. The discussions in some ways served to reinforce divides between businesses (drawn to ethereum's aggressive problem solving) and developers (who have shown a preference for approaches that emphasize conservatism and security). In the face of technical disagreement, though, unity was often found in rhetoric that positioned bitcoin as a vehicle capable of checking potentially hostile world powers. One executive of one of the industry's largest incumbent supporters, for example, gave a keynote address in which he talked at length about his discussions with other enterprise firms. ""You have people so nervous,"" he said. There was also humor to be found in barbs aimed at some of the institutions that have gone so far as to announce trials and proofs-of-concept using the blockchain technology. ""They have not internalized how much they have to change. You've shown up with a Ferrari and they're insisting on putting a lawnmower in it,"" he said. Yet, there were also pleas for bitcoin's enthusiasts to commit to certain core values, an argument that was made under the assumption that pressures from outside influencers will only continue as the technology continues to grow. One guest remarked: This argument later saw additional color in a more technical session aimed at revisiting the value that each of bitcoin's features provides. On the list, sketched out on a marker board, were topics including fraud management, transaction finality, opt-in transparency and permissionlessness. Notable in the discussion was that attendees displayed a willingness to prioritize features that were perhaps less likely to be obvious to users, an assumption carried out under the premise that such design decisions are being made in the greater good. ""I think the majority people wouldn't care if it ended up as all the bad things in one spot. Someone would find that worst case acceptable, because as long as you're playing by the rules, you're getting rich,"" one attendee argued. The discussion went on to envision scenarios in which bitcoin could plausibly exist, but in ways that diminish the features those in attendance believe would make it more valuable. Yet, the conversation often felt like a return to square one in the way it sought to envision how bitcoin might best be described in a way that incorporates new understanding of the science that supports its distributed digital transactions. An attendee said: That's not to say that the discussion didn't provide advances. In conversation, prominent technologists seemed increasingly interested in testing scenarios in which a sidechain, or a blockchain featuring bitcoins pegged to the main blockchain, would be used as a way to extend the tech's functionality while preserving its core. Under this scenario, the bitcoin blockchain could theoretically support a separate blockchain that would have different features, such as say, an 8MB block limit as proposed by those in the community who favor more aggressive scaling tactics. The discussion focused on two particular sidechains proposals introduced in recent months, though which had not been broadly been considered as potential ways to achieve scaling. However, there was acknowledgement that other factors needed to be refined (such as how the sidechains would be secured). Also notable is that the idea would require the addition of new code to the bitcoin protocol by way of a soft fork, meaning miners would still have to signal support for the upgrade. Conceptually, however, the idea seemed to have support, and a potentially broad appeal. One attendee summed up the idea: Image via Pete Rizzo for CoinDesk

                            Despite Drop in Volume, Traders Stick With China's Bitcoin Exchanges                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/volume-traders-china-bitcoin-exchanges/,"Despite the fact that major Chinese exchanges have seen their bitcoin volumes take a hit after introducing trading fees, these bourses still stand out as some of the top marketplaces when ranked by volume, according to market data. OKCoin, BTCC and Huobi experienced significant declines in trading volume after they began charging fees, beginning on 24th January. The decision to charge these fees built upon their earlier move to eliminate margin trading – two developments which thus far have had a clear impact on the market. The shift came amid scrutiny from Chinese regulators, including the country's central bank. Not only has trading volume fallen, but volatility has been subdued, with bitcoin prices trading in a tight range between $885 and $905 on 25th January, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. Following the market’s recent shifts, OKCoin and BTCC emerged as top exchanges for trading activity on 25th January, reporting 15.1k BTC and 12.56 BTC worth of volume during the 24 hours through roughly 21:00 UTC on that session, according to data from Bitcoinity. Market data for Huobi, another major Chinese exchange, was not available on Bitcoinity at press time.  These 24-hour trading volume figures present a strong contrast to market data from the last seven days, during which market participants traded 2.13M BTC through OKCoin and 1.48M BTC through BTCC. When the figures are averaged out, OKCoin saw daily trading volume of roughly 300k BTC, while BTCC experienced approximately 210k BTC worth of trades.  With such drastically lower trading volume and reduced volatility, one can not help but wonder whether the bitcoin markets have entered a new normal. A perfect example of how much the landscape has changed is the more even distribution of trading volume across exchanges worldwide, as shown by the Bitcoinity data below:  Some traders have already responded to the new situation by changing up their strategies, according Vinny Lingham, CEO of identity startup Civic. He told CoinDesk: Other market participants, by contrast, appear to be still figuring out exactly how to should respond to the latest new from China’s major exchanges, according to Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. He told CoinDesk that the market is split into two camps, with one seeing the developments as positive, believing that “regulation legitimizes bitcoin”. The other side maintains the Chinese government intervention could be negative for bitcoin, and the fees could “dampen trading volume and interest in China"", he said. Image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Prices Dip Below $900 After Trading Volume Drop                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-dips-900-trading-volume-drop/," Bitcoin prices fell below $900 during late-night trading, continuing that trend as the day progresses. The digital currency’s price tumbled yesterday after major exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin began imposing trading fees following guidance from China's central bank. That move triggered a broad decline in volume at these exchanges. This development, combined with the previous announcement that those exchanges would halt margin trading, seems to have placed some downward pressure on prices. Bitcoin fell to as little as $885.72 on 24th January, roughly 2.5% below their daily high of $908.39, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At the start of 25th January, prices averaged $885.65, additional BPI figures reveal. Bitcoin prices rose to as much as $902.73 at 02:45 UTC, before quickly dropping below $900 once again. At press time, the price of bitcoin is at an average of $895.46, an increase of just over 1% from the day's open. CNY-denominated markets are up more than 5% today. After opening the day at ¥5,868.13, CNY-denominated markets climbed to as high as ¥6,307.26. Prices are currently averaging ¥6,237.62, BPI data shows. Bitcoin prices have experienced a period of relative stability, according to the BPI, fluctuating between roughly $880 and $940 since 19th January. This market state sharply contrasts with earlier this month, when bitcoin prices experienced sharp gyrations, rising to a three-year high and falling close to $200 within a single hour.

                            Scaling Revisited: What If Bitcoin's Big 'Problem' is Its Great Strength?                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-scaling-biggest-problem-greatest-stregth-satoshi-roundtable/,"""Maybe it's not as big a problem as we think it is."" That sentiment, summed up by bitcoin lending startup founder Shawn Owen, was one of the more notable threads to emerge yesterday at the third annual Satoshi Roundtable, one that followed nearly six hours of debate on challenges facing the technology. A gathering for well-connected early adopters, top technical minds and institutional evangelists in sunny Cancun, Mexico, the event played host to discussions on a diverse set of issues (token sales, regulation, policy, etc). However, scaling, or the means by which the open-source technology's rules could be altered to accommodate more users, was high on the agenda. Though short on conclusions (perhaps owing to issues with this approach in last year), the discussion was notable for its range of approaches to the topic. Far from just a technical problem, though, there seems to be a sense among bitcoin's avid supporters that the current challenges are more philosophical and social, made worse by entrenched interests who have an economic incentive for their opinions. Chief among the topics up for discussion was the state of industry dialogue itself, with advocates from bitcoin's main technological camps – those in favor of solutions such as Segregated Witness as well as so-called 'on-chain' scaling initiatives – agreeing perhaps only that the issue is now almost completely mired in disagreement. Yet, opinions on the state of industry discussion are evolving in unexpected ways. For example, one acknowledged area of disconnect is increasingly the question of whether or not bitcoin even has a problem. Even without scaling, the reasoning goes, the price is high and interest in the platform and its security remains strong. As put forward by BitGo software engineer Jameson Lopp, perhaps bitcoin's biggest issue isn't really one at all. He told CoinDesk: At stake here is which version is likely to contribute to a stronger platform, and which one adheres more to its original espoused values – some of which many network participants have devoted years of their life to achieve. ""You have 'decentralized and secure', and then you have 'buy a coffee',"" one participant said. Equally notable were the attempts by discussion participants to understand the motivations on either side of the aisle. Much thought, for instance, was put into SegWit (a proposal authored by bitcoin's main technological working group) and why it has yet to be adopted by the network's miners. In attendance was one representative of China's mining community who framed the problem as one that was nearly all political, suggesting that miners were blocking the proposal purely out of a distrust of its technical working group, Bitcoin Core. Of note is that major miners, he said, have enough stake in the network to block advancements of the proposal – in almost any form. One idea – that SegWit first be tested on the alternative blockchain platform litecoin as means to showcase its benefits – was met with similar obstacles. While some argued litecoin has perhaps a better chance of adopting the measure, many of its miners are also bitcoin miners who could just as easily impede progress there. Also discussed was whether China's miners even perceived there to be any problems with the network itself, and if their continued receipt of rewards would incentivize this group not to pursue any action out of a lack of obvious need. Yet, there was a minority view that bitcoin's inability to achieve any technical consensus on a change was perhaps a 'feature not a bug', to use an industry analogy. John Carvalho, a marketing manager at bitcoin livestreaming platform Xotika.tv, for example, argued that the dialogue itself is perhaps misguided, and that bitcoin is simply proving itself at defending complex social and political attacks. ""Everybody here is projecting their own commercial interests onto bitcoin saying that it's stagnating or failing,"" he said, adding: Lopp argued that BitGo, for example, is onboarding more users, and that it is ultimately this growth that should define the conversation. However, Justin Newton, CEO of digital identity startup Netki, offered a different take. A veteran of the dot-com days, he argued that the view that bitcoin's inability to achieve any bottom-up decision-making isn't one that should be necessarily lauded. ""Saying you don't have a governance model, doesn't mean you don't,"" he said. ""It may not be a transparent process that is auditable and repeatable, but the process exists."" Elsewhere, there were signs that there was an increasing appetite for a discussion that would break the months of indecision on how bitcoin could be improved. There appeared some interest in bridging the gap between the two camps with a compromise that would find bitcoin's developers committing to increase the network's block size, a long-contentious technical attribute that mitigates transaction volume, to 2MB, a change that would accompany the approval of SegWit. Still, there was not broad agreement that consensus could be achieved. Amidst a backdrop of egos battling egos, others cautioned that even the idea that the 'scaling debate' was a finite issue to be solved is impeding progress. As reasoned by Kraken employee Yifu Guo, all scaling solutions are temporary fixes for battles that will continue on until the technology goes mainstream.

The People's Bank of China (PBoC) released its latest statement detailing how it would oversee the industry today, a move that comes weeks after it first began publicizing meetings with representatives from BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin. The PBoC went on to say that it would oversee the space more closely, later finding fault with the exchange’s policies on margin trading (though no penalties have been levied). According to the PBoC, that scrutiny will continue via additional on-site inspections. The central bank said in a translated statement: The statement also included a warning to investors, who the central bank said ""should pay attention to bitcoin platform transactions, such as legal compliance, market volatility, financial security and other risks"". The PBoC’s statement comes amid a sea change within the country’s exchange ecosystem. Following guidance from the central bank, the three major exchanges ultimately halted their leveraged trading services, and this week launched new fees on trading. Yet while prices have seen a drop in volatility, volume at those exchanges has fallen sharply in the wake of the adjustments.

                            Real Volumes Revealed? How China's Bitcoin Market is Adapting to Fees                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/real-volumes-revealed-bitcoin-reacting-new-age-trading-fees/," Bitcoin volumes fell sharply yesterday, a move that illustrated the market’s strong response to a previously announced decision by China-based exchanges to end 'no fee' trading policies and halt margin lending. Though analysts had long speculated as to what the result of the change would be (given assertions that the markets were being bolstered by high-frequency traders), the results have so far been more extreme than projected. Overall, the lower volume at these three major exchanges has had a depressing effect, reducing transaction activity across the board.  In response, analysts quickly highlighted the potential benefits of the situation. Entrepreneur and investor Vinny Lingham described the declines as ""healthy and positive moves"", predicting the market will enjoy new and genuine price discovery. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, also provided an upbeat assessment, telling CoinDesk: While the input of these market analysts can certainly prove insightful, it is helpful to take a look at some hard numbers. BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi all saw their trading volume drop early on 24th January. For example, market participants traded less than 8,000 BTC through BTCC in the session's first hour, nearly 80% less than the 37,000 BTC the exchange recorded during the final hour of the 23rd January session, Bitcoinity data reveals. This trend of sharp reduction continued, and trading volume reached a daily low of 138 BTC during the hour through 06:00 UTC before experiencing sharp gyrations. This transaction activity rose to roughly 1,100 BTC and 2,300 BTC in the next two hours, before falling back to levels that were almost as depressed as the daily low.  OKCoin's trading volume followed a similar trajectory, plunging more than 50% from roughly 26,000 BTC during the final hour of 23rd January to approximately 13,000 BTC in the first hour of 24th January, Bitcoinity data shows. This downward trend continued until trading volume fell to less than 500 BTC during the hour through 08:00 UTC. Hourly transaction activity managed to stage a recovery after this, rising to almost 3,000 BTC at one point. But it declined significantly after, reaching roughly 126 BTC. Notably, the last three hours through 20:00 UTC all experienced volume of less than 200 BTC.  Huobi’s trading volume suffered an even sharper drop than that of BTCC and OKCoin in the first hour of today’s session, declining more than 80% to roughly 382 BTC from 2,387 BTC in the prior session’s final hour, according to Cryptowatch. The exchange’s transaction volume did push higher later in the day, rising to an hourly volume of close to 1,500 BTC. However, it never came close to the hourly volume of 11,900 BTC attained on 23rd January. Now that the major Chinese exchanges have imposed fees, several market observers have forecast that the development will have a significant impact on the market. While some of these analysts – for example Lingham and Zivkovski – made optimistic predictions about this situation, not everyone provided a rosy assessment. While the People’s Bank of China’s (PBoC) decision to crack down on local trading could simply help “rein in” the minor transactions of hobbyist algorithmic traders, it could potentially provoke concerns in the markets, according to cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff. ""The larger fear is that the PBoC's tougher stance will scare off the Chinese buyers who've driven BTC to these heights,"" he said. Eliosoff ended on a bearish projection, suggesting a prolonged volume slump could have a much more significant impact on the price, adding: Dry hose image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoinâs Price Unfazed as Chinaâs Exchanges Add Fees                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-china-exchange-fees/," Bitcoin prices have remained largely unchanged so far today, fluctuating around the $900 mark despite the adoption of trading fees by three of the ecosystem'sÂ largest exchanges. As previously announced, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin implemented 0.2% trading fees for both buy and sell trades today, a policy change that, coupled with their recent decision to end margin trading at the request of China'sÂ central bank, seems to be making for a different market. Market data suggests that all three bitcoin exchanges have seen a drop in volume after instituting the new pricing policy. The fees, they say, were put in place in a bid to stop market manipulation and lessen the effects of price volatility. The exchanges announced the move over the weekend. Initiated today, the trading fees do seem to be having an impact on trading volumes, if not prices. According to data from Bitcoinity, for example, there were roughly 4,800 trades on OKCoin between the hours of 11pm and midnight EST. In the following hour, the exchange registered just over 1,000 trades, denominated in CNY â a fall of more than 80%.  Data pulled from Bitcoinity for BTCChina also demonstrates the apparent effect the new trading fees have had on volume. After registering more than 37,000 trades between the hours of 7 and 8pm EST, that amount had fallen to less than 1,000 between the hours of midnight and 1am EST.  Bitcoinity data wasnât available for HuobiÂ past 22nd January. However, according to CryptoWatch, another exchange data provider, declines in Huobiâs volume can also be seen. Daily trade volume has fluctuated between 120k and 150k bitcoins for the past few days, yet as of press time, Huobi has reported less than 38,000 BTC in trading volume since the start of the session. Even so, the price of bitcoin seems to have taken the fee additions in stride. According to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the current average price is $905.35, down just 0.8% from the dayâs open. CNY-denominated markets, by contrast, are up more than 6% today, trading at an average of Â¥6,272, BPI data shows. Given that the fee change had been anticipated, traders, even those based in China, struck a mostly optimistic tone on the news. Kong Gao, marketing manager at OTC trading firm Richfund, for example, called the new volume figures âmore organicâ. He framed the development as good for the bitcoin market in the long term, even if the market has to adapt to new constraints. Likewise, trader Zhao Dong said that the new numbers were a reflection of the decline in high-frequency traders, which would impact speculators, a group he called the digital currencyâs largest market. âThe real volume (people who need to use bitcoin) is 10,000 to 20,000,â he said. âShort term speculation is 10 times that.â Given this, he predictedÂ that Chinaâs exchanges would soon be compelledÂ to make further changes. Zhao added: Stan Higgins co-authored this report. Images via Bitcoinity, Shutterstock

At the time, the company said that it “will be in the forefront of marketplaces embracing this new digital currency and security standards”. Nearly three years later, the marketplace is calling it quits. Redditors spotted the change over the weekend, highlighting how Fiverr had dropped bitcoin as a payment option. An email reportedly distributed to users suggested that the move was effective 19th January. When reached for comment, senior PR manager Sam Katzen confirmed that Fiverr was dropping the option. He told CoinDesk: Launched in 2010, Fiverr enables job outsourcing, with gigs being offered for contracts as low as $5. When it first adopted bitcoin payments, Fiverr joined a nascent yet promising ecosystem for freelancing, which included companies like Coinality and a subreddit dedicated to the use case.

                            Bitcoin Devs Are Feeling More Optimistic About MimbleWimble                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-devs-feeling-optimistic-mimblewimble/,"Work is advancing on a highly anticipated bitcoin project originally proposed by an anonymous cryptographer going under the French name of Harry Potter's nemesis. Named after one of the book series' spells, MimbleWimble has quickly became one of the more anticipated bitcoin R&D initiatives, since it is believed it could help improve upon the scalability and fungibility of bitcoin in a unique way. One of the major downsides of the original design, however, was that despite granting greater privacy and scalability, it looked like it might not support many of bitcoin's more complicated scripts (which allow users to use more advanced transactions). But, it looks to be progressing on that front. Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra provided the update on the MimbleWimble mailing list, where he dives into the possibilities of the proposed change. For the non-technical, the gist is that it might be possible to plug many of bitcoin's current capabilities into the new style of transactions. (The proposed change amounts to adding support for hash pre-images, a cryptographic tool that could enable a few fancier transaction types). Although, the plan is still likely to implement it as an altcoin or a sidechain. Poelstra went into some more detail about some of the capabilities MimbleWimble could potentially support, such as zero-knowledge contingent payments (which allow users to buy information privately), and cross-chain atomic swaps (which let users exchange cryptocurrencies in a decentralized way). But, it's a new idea, and none of the details are set in stone yet. Poelstra mentioned that this would require a small change to MimbleWimble, but that it might be worth ""a full paper with more detail."" Code image via Shutterstock

According to information provided to CoinDesk, the EuromarchÃ© grocery store on Rue Lachapelle in MontrÃ©al was targeted around 10:30pm EST. A store representative reported two unidentified individuals were involved with the theft. Camera footage was taken of the incident and provided to local authorities with a formal report, the representative said. The store was closed when the theft took place. The ATM was a Lamassu brand machine, operated by vendor Instacoin (which runs machines in cities like Toronto, Ottowa and MontrÃ©al, according to CoinATMRadar.com). Instacoin did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The representative said that the ATM had been located at the store for roughly three years, and that this is the first crime to occur in conjunction with its operation. The theft comes more than a year after thieves struck an Atlanta smoke shop, an incident during which one of the assailants fired their gun at the floor. Further, it follows reports that as many as 70 bitcoin ATMs in the US Midwest have been attacked as part of a dispute between two rival firms. Image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Options Firm LedgerX Crosses Key Launch Hurdle                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-options-firm-ledgerx-crosses-key-launch-hurdle/," The wait is almost over for LedgerX, a New York-based bitcoin swaps startup with a board boasting a who's who of financial sector bigwigs. After two years of building, the firm that had already raised $1.5m from Google Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners and others, says it is now ready to push for its final approval from the US regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). If granted, LedgerX would be able to launch a federally regulated bitcoin options exchange and the first clearing house to list and clear fully collateralized, physically settled bitcoin options for the institutional market. In fact, LedgerX quietly overcame what its team believes is its last hurdle toward that goal in December. The problem was, to protect LedgerX’s future customers, the startup was required to hold a minimum amount of capital relative to its expected business volume – cash the startup didn't have. In response, LedgerX managed to raise an undisclosed amount of capital from Miami International Holdings, Inc. The startup's co-founder Juthica Chou told CoinDesk the cash infusion was the last piece of the puzzle that needed to fall into place before the CFTC could make its final decision. Of course, the regulatory body that oversees US futures and options markets could still say no. Speaking with CoinDesk at LedgerX's New York headquarters, Chou explained why her company raised the capital, and what a federally regulated clearing house for bitcoin could mean for the stability of the cryptocurrency's price. She said: While bitcoin-to-bitcoin derivatives already exist, as do cash-to-cash derivatives, this suite of investment products would be the first to let US dollars settle to bitcoin, according to Chou. Such a product could potentially help decrease price volatility for the cryptocurrency, which has a current market cap of $16.1bn. Initially, LedgerX plans to release physically settled 'puts and calls' – the most basic, or 'vanilla' options that a swaps execution facility (SEF) can offer – for a tenure of between one and six months. Though the firm isn’t allowed to take on customers until after it receives CFTC approval, Chou said she breaks down her potential clients into three categories: institutional companies that are naturally long on bitcoin, institutions that are naturally short, and traders that sit in the middle to provide liquidity. In the end, though, one of the most valuable side-effects of receiving the CFTC license could end up being the data generated by LedgerX, according to Chou. Currently, she said, industry data is focused on realized volatility data. But with LedgerX's emergence on the market, the company could launch options products that result in potentially valuable implied volatility data. She said: While LedgerX may indeed achieve a series of industry firsts, it is by no means alone in offering bitcoin swaps. New Jersey-based TeraExchange, for example, was granted a temporary registration as a swap execution facility (SEF) in September 2013. Since settling with the CFTC for failing to enforce certain prohibitions, the platform now offers a short-term bitcoin forward, settled in US dollars, as well as offering a bitcoin price index. While TeraExchange tends to focus on linear swaps, LedgerX hopes to list options which could allow customers to monetize bitcoin's volatility, even while possibly minimizing that same volatility. Another distinction Chou makes is that, if LedgerX is approved, customers will be able to receive actual bitcoin as settlement and not just dividends in US dollars equal to the value in bitcoin. TeraExchange declined to comment for this report. The newly confirmed acting chairman of the CFTC, Christopher Giancarlo, laid out his plans to only lightly regulate blockchain-related products last week at the SEFCON conference in New York, dedicated to the swaps industry. Notably, LedgerX co-founder Paul Chou sits on the CFTC tech advisory committee, while former CFTC commissioner Mark Wetjen sits on LedgerX's board of directors. Perhaps the biggest impact an eventual CFTC approval could have on the market is the creation of an SEF that is also a derivatives clearing organization (DCO). As a DCO, LedgerX would become the first federally regulated entity to guarantee bitcoin clearing and settlement of trades. Juthica Chou said: The result of an increasingly diverse derivatives market could be a less volatile bitcoin price, according to Chou and other industry observers. ARK Invest analyst and blockchain products lead Chris Burniske is quick to point out that there are many kinds of swaps that LedgerX and others could build, and not all of them would necessarily result in increased liquidity. But over time, a more diverse ecosystem of bitcoin derivatives could give institutional investors and traders more control over their risk, increasing ""appetite for volatile assets like bitcoin"" and resulting in deeper bitcoin market liquidity, he said. ""More liquid markets generally work to decrease volatility,"" said Burniske, ""as order books can better absorb buy and sell shocks."" And while Chou says LedgerX plans to start 'vanilla', she added that the firm expects to expand its offering once the license is granted and business stabilizes. Chou concluded: Leaping hurdle image via Shutterstock

                            China's Bitcoin Exchanges End No-Fee Trading in Market Shake-Up                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-big-three-bitcoin-exchanges-end-no-fee-policy/,"China's 'Big Three' bitcoin exchange businesses are taking new steps to ""curb speculation"" and ""prevent volatility"" in the nascent digital currency market. Announced this weekend, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin – the country's largest bitcoin trading platforms by volume – jointly revealed their intention to end their years-long practice of offering no-fee bitcoin trades, introducing a 0.2% fixed-rate fee on all buy and sell orders for bitcoin and the alternative digital currency litecoin beginning 24th January. The announcement is the latest that finds China's major bitcoin trading platforms responding to apparent regulatory pressures from the People's Bank of China (PBoC). Following bitcoin's rise to near all-time highs at the beginning of this year, the startups have faced new scrutiny from the central bank, which appears to have taken a more active interest in their offerings. News came just days after all three exchanges ended margin trading, and talk soon followed that pricing changes could be forthcoming. BTCC, the most vocal of China's major exchanges since discussions were made public on 6th January, said it is reconsidering how it would price trades. Over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong indicated his belief that the policy shifts will impact liquidity in the markets by making high-frequency trading less appealing, changes that he foresees having affect on other exchange users. Yet, Zhao cautioned he believes the move could be temporary, telling CoinDesk: At press time, the announcements did not seem to be having a negative impact on the price of bitcoin, which (while volatile) traded higher on 22nd January than it did over much of the proceeding week. Elsewhere, the decision was greeted with enthusiasm. Broad and Bright partner Roland Su, legal lead for the China-based blockchain consortium Hyperledger, told CoinDesk he believes fees will help the market become less speculative. ""The trading volume will drop, but won't hurt the price too much,"" he predicted. In interview, China-based traders and market representatives preferred to emphasize the positive aspects of the recent announcement, and how, while the central bank has yet to ban bitcoin trading, it had made clear that change was required. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, said that the announcements represented a recognition by exchanges that the PBoC was concerned about prices rising ""too high, too fast"", and that this, as well as suspicions it may be used for capital flight, helped spark the action. ""The regulators have their opinion, they want more real volume. We got together to be one step ahead,"" Lee said. Lee went on to note that bitcoin is not yet regulated in China, and that as such, the PBoC is also fairly restrained in how it can oversee the nascent industry. Overall, he compared this to the arrival of a cop on a highway, noting that the natural reaction of drivers is to slow their speed in such a scenario, even when no action is taken on behalf of law enforcement. Likewise, representatives from Huobi indicated that most of its customers understood the reason for the decision and that it met customer expectations. The exchange also sought to downplay concerns that it could face new business pressures as a result in the change in fees, with a representative stating: Representatives from OKCoin declined further comment, emphasizing the firm's written statements. The reactions from general enthusiasts and traders were more mixed, however. On social media, some praised the news as a way to bring exchanges – as well as bitcoin as a technology – more in line with expectations from local regulators. Others celebrated what they considered to be an end to practices that they believe to be contributing to an overrepresentation of China-based exchanges in global exchange volume. Still, other observers said that international exchanges could move to lower fees in a bid to stoke competition. When asked if there was any agreement that China's exchanges would hold to the pricing model for a set time, Lee provided no firm answer, stating that it remains to be seen whether certain ""behaviors"" will be required of domestic exchanges. ""I think the future will tell us. I don't know the answer,"" he said. Other more obscure theories abounded as well, with market analyst George Samman stating that he believes the new fees could push China-based traders toward alternative digital currencies and blockchain-based assets with higher potential returns. Notably, the announcement will not affect another bitcoin exchange that had just last week promised to follow what it called China's successful no-fee policies. In statements, representatives from London-based Coinfloor said the exchange remains committed to the offering and that the exchange is excited about winning new business. ""We always rethink things but we came to the same conclusion – no trading fees is the way to go,"" founder Mark Lamb told CoinDesk. Such statements suggest bitcoin's exchange market could see more changes in the days and weeks ahead as the market adjusts to the news. Yuan image image via Shutterstock

                            Is Bitcoin App Abra Finally Ready for Its Big Debut?                        ",Jonathan Keane,https://www.coindesk.com/is-bitcoin-app-abra-finally-ready-for-its-big-debut/," At this week's North American Bitcoin Conference, P2P digital cash startup Abra announced that, starting next month, it will begin its long-awaited global rollout. It's a move that Abra has had in the works since May, when CEO Bill Barhydt said he was eager for the startup, founded in 2014, to make the transition ""as quickly as possible"". Notably, the latest news provided new details on what this long-held plan might look like in action. In a blog post published this week, Abra revealed that, at launch, its wallets will support the buying, selling and storing of bitcoin, as well as over 50 traditional currencies, which it said can also be sent peer-to-peer using the service. According to Barhydt, the system is now ready for primetime. He told CoinDesk: The Silicon Valley-based startup will begin gradually launching the service in select markets, where users send digital cash via their phone number. As previously detailed, users can also act as tellers, providing liquidity to the system along with the startup's exchange partners. Abra users can find a teller nearby and carry out a cash transaction in exchange for bitcoin or fiat currency in the app. ""I hand that teller $500, he accepts the $500, pushes whatever currency is on his phone to my phone, it automatically gets converted to bitcoin regardless of which currency in their Abra wallet they're holding,"" Barhydt explained. ""The Abra system is capable of doing a dual foreign exchange transaction on the fly."" This feature is still being finalized, but if the on-boarding works with little or no hiccups, the firm will ""flip the switch globally,"" he said. At the core of the product is usability. Barhydt likes to point out how his mother, in her 70s, can use the Abra app with no issue. But in spite of the boasts, the CEO remained tight-lipped about the company's user numbers and teller numbers. He claimed the company will begin publishing statistics in late spring, but told CoinDesk that in the Philippines there are a few thousand tellers and a backlog of people applying to take on the role. It's a clichéd comparison, but the CEO likens the Abra system to Uber. Location and fees are some factors in choosing a teller, but so too are the ratings, which generate trust. The primary motivation for becoming a teller is, of course, making money. Tellers can set their own rates for transactions (from which the startup will take a cut of around 20%), so the cost for users will vary. ""If you're in Mexico City, the teller is going to get away with 1–2.5% for money in and money out and be very competitive with ATMs,"" he said. On the other hand, he said someone in a rural location with fewer users around, you may get away with rates as high as 3–5%. However, Barhydt believes some tellers will use the app in settings like relief work and charities to help people get access to money. In these cases, no rate is charged and Abra takes no cut. ""Their motivation is helping people help themselves, like giving them access to financial services that they normally wouldn’t have access to,"" he said. ""Think about Somalia, think about the African refugees that are coming to Europe."" Abra is pushing the teller system hard, and it wants everyday people to sign up and become tellers to help grow the network. Yet, according to some technology observers, the ability for such a network to take off remains in question. To Dr Paul Ennis, assistant professor at University College Dublin, it's still difficult to tell if this teller model will work at scale, but not just because it's built on the bitcoin network. ""As novel as human ATMs sound, I think all that will matter to most people are the fundamentals – namely, are they cheaper than Western Union when it comes to remittances?"" he said. Ennis emphasized that the cost factor would like be an issue for any user, even those who had previously used only an open-source wallet on top of bitcoin. He called it a challenge, but potentially an ""exceptionally rewarding one"". Still, Barhydt envisions that, in the short term, most Abra users will be using tellers, but eventually more people will integrate their bank accounts too. ""My prediction is that 50% will use Abra via bank accounts using our exchange partner integration, and 50% will use the teller network,"" he said. The main barrier to that right now is the paucity of exchange partners in major markets. It currently has no such partners in Europe, so if the app launches there soon, only the teller system will be available. Barhydt said it is working on deals in this area to facilitate more people linking their bank accounts. ""We've been working with exchanges all over the world for some time and expect to see lots of announcements in that area,"" he said. All in all, Barhydt has plenty of lofty ideas about what Abra can become, but expectations may need to be managed. Currently, the startup is letting a select number of merchants accept payments with a view to selling merchant APIs in the future. Once again it sounds all very simple, but it’s going to take time. The reality is that Abra still needs to build up its network of tellers, get more liquidity in the system and constantly improve the usability to make it attractive to merchants in the first place. Some observers have been positive about the firm's plan. ""I believe Abra's model is potentially viable,"" Dr Garrick Hileman, senior research associate at the Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance, told CoinDesk. He added: It's a work in progress, but next month’s global launch marks a significant step for the startup, which has raised $14m in VC funding so far. Barhydt concludes by saying he believes the world hasn't seen anything like Abra before: Globes image via Shutterstock

This edition looks at the week from 14th through 20th January.  After a wild start to 2017, bitcoin took it slow this week. This relative calm was punctuated by a handful of sharp fluctuations, which saw the digital currency’s price fall to as little as $810 on 15th January and rise to as much as $914 on 18th January, data reveals. But, despite the calm, there was uncertainty under the surface. According to analysts, the market is still reluctant to make big moves in the wake of continued news from China that has found its central bank more actively engaging with local exchanges. For now, this is keeping traders on the sidelines. Ryan Rabaglia, head trader and digital asset specialist at Octagon Strategy, described the situation as one where 'wait and see' is still the attitude. ""Although the last round of news out of the mainland has seemingly been fully digested, we're still seeing most traders sitting on the sidelines,"" he told CoinDesk, adding: This state of mind contrasts, however, with market performance. Bitcoin prices surged close to 10% on 17th January, climbing to as much as $908.13, but overall, markets have struggled to move above that mark. The digital currency proceeded to fluctuate below $900 for most of the week’s remainder, trading at $894 at the time of reporting. While the PBoC investigation started out with central bank officials meeting with representatives of OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC, the first two of these major Chinese exchanges have now ceased margin trading. This means the big question for now is, how will the lack of margin impact liquidity at what are effectively the world's largest exchanges. In this context, bitcoin prices will likely trade within a range between $850 and $950 for some time, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin exchange BitMEX. ""The market also needs to absorb the unwind of the Chinese margin books,"" he told CoinDesk. Hayes is certainly not the only one optimistic about bitcoin markets moving forward, as other analysts – and market data – appear bullish. Market sentiment has pushed higher over the last several days, as data provided by leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub shows the market was 91% and 93% long on 19th and 20th January, respectively. Petar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub, noted the currency’s price recovery in recent week as a positive sign, but emphasized that the markets are cautious. Compounding matters is that China is still the effective center of bitcoin trading activity. Though data sources peg the market share of its exchanges at 95%, recent market assessments beg this closer to 85%. Either way, both data points are indicative of what's at stake. According to analyst Jacob Eliosoff, the ongoing developments surrounding the nation’s central bank could make China even more important than usual in the days and weeks ahead.

Following his inauguration today – not so much. On 9th November, prices bounced more than 3% as Trump, the controversial businessman and Republican presidential nominee, secured the votes to clinch the election versus former US secretary of state Hillary Clinton. That move came as stock markets worldwide sharply fell as Trump's victory became apparent. The reaction to Trump's inauguration, by contrast, was far more muted. Data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) shows that today’s prices have largely stuck to the same track seen in the past few days, primarily staying within the range in the upper $800s. Prices hit a low of $882.30 at around 10:15 UTC, hours before Trump’s inauguration. The average price of bitcoin is currently $893.61, BPI figures reveal. At press time, CNY-denominated markets are up more than 5% from the day’s open, hitting a high of ¥6,175.30. CNY markets are reporting an average price of ¥6,129.19, according to the BPI.

                            Ex-Gemini Lawyer: SEC 'Unlikely' to Approve a Bitcoin ETF                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/ex-gemini-lawyer-sec-unlikely-to-approve-winklevoss-bitcoin-etf/," One of the lawyers who helped craft the application for what would be the first-ever bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is doubtful the SEC will approve such a request any time in the near future. The critique, courtesy of former Gemini general counsel David Brill, potentially cuts deep, as his old employer's last and final deadline to receive approval for the experimental product is on 11th March. Though Brill is quick to point out he is a “proponent” of the creation of bitcoin ETFs and pro-bitcoin regulation more broadly, the prognosis does not bode well for its success. In conversation with CoinDesk, Brill explained that he believes factors such as China's impact on the price of bitcoin make an approval unlikely. Brill said: A career lawyer for 20 years, Brill worked at Thompson Financial from 2003 through 2010, when it acquired Reuters. Prior to departing Gemini last year, Brill worked as the New York-based exchange's general council, where he said he helped create the legal infrastructure of the exchange and craft a number of responses to amendments to its S1 filing. Though Brill does believe that that a bitcoin ETF will eventually be allowed to do business on a major stock exchange, he said the SEC will be unlikely to do so while as much as 95% of all bitcoin transactions are carried out in China, according to CoinDesk’s Q3 State of Blockchain report. That, coupled with the China government’s recent crackdown on cryptocurrency exchanges and anti-money laundering practices, makes for an even less likely approval, he said. ""It's more that the overwhelming majority of trading is not being done in the US, and being done in an area where the rules and regulations are not consistent with the rules here,"" said Brill. Later today, Brill plans to address the members of the American Bar Association (ABA) at its Derivatives and Futures Law Committee Meeting in Florida. At the committee meeting, he intends to detail his concerns regarding the future of bitcoin ETFs, as well as the potential impact of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency's proposed plans for a federal FinTech charter that might eventually give some bitcoin companies bank status. Similar to his concerns about the approval of a bitcoin ETF, Brill said that while he'd like to see the charter applied to bitcoin exchanges that meet the requirements, he's skeptical this will come to pass. ""I would say that eventually it could be open for bitcoin companies,"" he said. ""But right now, there are real issues regarding the scope of the charter and some real disagreements between the states, a number of Democratic Senators, and the OCC."" Specifically, Brill pointed to opposition from individual US states, some of which allege the OCC has overstepped its power, even if the end goal is to make the US more competitive with other nations. Earlier this week, the superintendent of the New York State Department of Financial Services, Maria Vullo, submitted a comment letter to the OCC in opposition to the proposed national bank charter for financial technology companies. Vullo wrote: Furthermore, just a day earlier, senators Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) and Jeff Merkley (D-Ore), wrote a similar letter in opposition to the charter, citing concerns that it would allow the proliferation of ""predatory alternative financial services providers,"" according to American Banker. Speaking shortly before Donald Trump’s inauguration as President, Brill said he is cautiously optimistic about a more promising environment for bitcoin companies in the future. From a strictly local business perspective, he predicted Trump would likely take a pro-bitcoin stance. However, considering concerns about a possible ""trade war"" with China following Trump’s expected policies, Brill said the predominance of bitcoin trading in the nation could be a hindrance. In his ABA address today, Brill said he intends to speak to a larger trend of creating a more fertile regulatory environment for bitcoin startups. He concluded: Crumpled dollar image via Shutterstock

                            Blockstream Makes its Case for Bitcoin-Powered Private Blockchains                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-blockstream-making-case-new-kind-private-blockchain/," Private and public blockchains, normally siloed both technologically and culturally, could become more intertwined if a new effort by bitcoin startup Blockstream gets off the ground. The venture-backed firm is best known for iterating on top of the open-source bitcoin protocol with projects such as the Lightning Network and sidechains, the latter of which aims to allow users to send assets back and forth between blockchains 'pegged' to bitcoin. At the same time, the startup has been working on more enterprise-oriented projects, perhaps biting into the recent buzz and experimentation with private blockchains that typically have a few known participants managing the system. The latest announcement finds Blockstream expanding on the next steps for a project called Liquid, unveiled in late 2015. A sidechain that many bitcoin exchanges have been integrating for faster money transfers, the project has been slow to see wider release – at least compared to the initial rosy projections of a Q1 2016 offering. But though Liquid is still not yet production-ready, on Wednesday Blockstream released its second white paper, opening up the details of Liquid's model to the public and, possibly, signifying a step towards permissioned sidechains seeing wider use. Once the code is open sourced, companies will have the means to spin up their own versions of the technology. Of note is one of the more interesting claims in the paper, one that alleges the approach provides a better alternative to other private blockchains, at least for some use cases. Blockstream's Alexandre Bergeron told CoinDesk: He added that other consensus models in the space are ""complex"" and ""not well-studied,"" making it ""difficult to predict how they might react to 'adversarial conditions'"". The project's backers say its so-called 'strong federations' could allow financial institutions to pin certain types of private sidechains to the bitcoin blockchain, in part to take advantage of the network’s security and the control that it gives to users. In conversation with CoinDesk, Bergeron emphasized that this gives participants another option if the federation goes awry. ""If they don’t feel like participating anymore, users can return to the main chain and be done with it,"" Bergeron said. Andrew Poelstra, a mathematician for Blockstream, said that the paper constitutes ""a pile of improvements"" over other systems given the company's experimentation with new bitcoin features such as SegWit and confidential transactions, which shield transaction information, on testing sidechains. A sidechain using confidential transactions would also potentially be more private than the main bitcoin blockchain, as it stands today. ""They provide commercial privacy with support for transactions where asset types and amounts are opaque while preserving the public verifiability inherent to bitcoin,"" the announcement blog post reads. That said, Poelstra stressed that a strong federation needs certain conditions to work properly. The system requires a ""small, well-defined"" set of participants in order to make the guarantees that sidechains do. He described this state as ""Byzantine robust"". ""As long as the majority of the participants are acting correctly and adhering to the protocol, then we can prove that the system will continue to move forward and the trades will execute,"" he said. But, rather than having the bitcoin blockchain secure the network, a group of signers is responsible for validating the transaction history, similar to other private blockchain structures. (The paper further explains how participants are incentivized to do ""the right thing""). As far as how such an arrangement would impact bitcoin, Poelstra explained that the main network remains safe even if such a federation implodes. ""If there’s anything wrong with bitcoin that would affect the sidechain, but the other direction doesn't apply,"" he said. So, where might this system be useful? Bergeron argued that it could provide a more efficient mechanism for prime brokerage, which normally requires a third party to help quickly move, say, $1m. ""What Liquid does is it replicates this model, but it removes the custodianship aspect. Participants can commit their funds to the system without requiring a third party to hold and operate the movement of funds between each other,"" he explained. He continued: On the other hand, Poelstra described it in much broader terms, framing the concept as potentially useful for ""any system where there's a small, fixed set of participants who want to work together contractually, but don't fully trust each other"". He stressed that it offers other properties, again pointing out the privacy guarantees and the way in which participants can ensure others are playing by the rules, so to speak, while at the same time hiding information (perhaps financial) they wish to keep private. Though this might seem like a novel direction for sidechains, onlookers might be more excited about Blockstream’s ""other"" idea for the technology: to allow the means to move tokens between public blockchains with different rule sets without having to trust an intermediary. This was one idea described in the company's first white paper two years ago. But, they might have a ways to go, as not all bitcoin developers are convinced that current sidechain implementations will uphold the security of the main bitcoin network. Although bitcoin developer Chris Stewart argued on social media that trustless sidechains are actually ready to be deployed (the code has been put through its paces on a test Elements sidechain), he asserts that bitcoin’s current political climate has perhaps stopped it from being implemented. Whatever the case, the strong federation system seems to be making some headway. It's not yet production-ready, according to Poelstra, but when it is, the next step is to open source it ""so that anyone will be able to take that code and use it"". In this light, he said, the team is releasing the paper in a bid to get feedback from academics and developers as the company looks to chart a strong course forward.

                            Bitcoin Prices Spike Above $900 But Turbulence Remains                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-prices-spike-900-turbulence-remains/," Bitcoin prices passed $900 today, though this feat was diminished by several rallies that ultimately failed to push its value above this benchmark. Overall, the digital currency rose to as much as $904.76, after falling below $880 earlier in the session, climbing above this level amid modest volatility. Later in the session, the price mounted another comeback, hitting a high just above $905, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). At press time, however, the price had dipped again to a value of $894.95. This upward movement represented the latest session of relatively mild price volatility, at least compared to the sharp price fluctuations experienced earlier this month. Most notable, however, about the day's trading, may have been the lack of any serious decline over the day's trading. Bitcoin prices enjoyed their latest climb in spite of new Chinese regulatory developments that found the nation’s exchanges responding publicly to pressures from the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank. Still, market sentiment has been bullish, according to figures provided by a handful of exchanges, even with the confirmation that major Chinese exchanges Huobi and OKCoin had stopped offering margin trading. The market was 91% long on 19th January, Whaleclub figures reveal. In addition, more than 53% of Bitfinex orders that were executed in the 24 hours through 22:15 UTC were buy orders, according to BFX Data. Airplane image via Shutterstock

                            Washington Lawmakers Are Trying to Keep Bitcoin Out of Pot Shops                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/washington-lawmakers-are-trying-to-keep-bitcoin-out-of-pot-shops/," UPDATE (19th January 22:25 BST): This article has been updated with comment from Sen. Ann Rivers, the primary sponsor of the bill. A new bill filed in the Washington State Senate is seeking to prohibit local marijuana businesses from using bitcoin. Sponsored by Senators Steve Conway and Ann Rivers, SB 5264 seeks to amend some of the state’s rules governing the sale and distribution of marijuana products. The move comes more than four years after Washington voters passed a ballot measure legalizing marijuana in November 2012. Under the proposed rule, businesses that work in the local marijuana industry would not be allowed to either pay for goods with digital currency or accept those kinds of payments from customers. The bill also includes a definition of ""virtual currency"" that explicitly targets ""digital representation[s] of value used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a store of value"", but excludes the ""the software or protocols governing the transfer"". Firms that grow marijuana or sell products that incorporate it would be covered under the proposed law's provisions. The bill states: Washington was notably the site of an early adopter of bitcoin among marijuana dispensaries: Spokane-based Kouchlock Productions. The firm began accepting payments in the digital currency in 2014 and would be affected by the new bill (representatives of the company did not immediately respond to a request for comment). In a statement, Sen. Ann Rivers said that the measure is aimed at boosting transparency in the state's marijuana industry, in a bid to ""help move it out of the shadows"". Rivers told CoinDesk: The measure, if passed, would likely be seen as a blow by proponents of the marijuana industry's use of digital currency as a means to circumvent a key issue facing those businesses today: a lack of banking access. Simply put, most US banks are loathe to allow marijuana-focused companies to open accounts due to the federal prohibition of marijuana. While some US states have passed ballot initiatives in recent years that have either approved medical or recreational use of marijuana, the federal ban keeps most banks on the sidelines. Some advocates have therefore argued that bitcoin and other digital currencies can help ease this pain point by giving those companies a functioning payment mechanism. Rob Fess, director of marketing for wholesale marijuana sales platform Tradiv, told CoinDesk that the proposed law further highlights the impact of the effective bank blockade against businesses in the industry. However, he suggested that some kind of legal backlash is likely in light of the proposal. “It seems like quite a stretch to single out a specific industry to be excluded from using a particular type of payment – I imagine the lawyers will have a field day with that,” he told CoinDesk.

                            Questions Linger As China's Bitcoin Exchanges Halt Margin Trading                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-largest-bitcoin-exchanges-halt-margin-trading-questions-remain/," Huobi and OKCoin, two of the world's largest bitcoin exchange businesses by volume, have formally announced they have halted margin trading services. In statements issued today on the OKCoin's Chinese-language website and Huobi's Weibo account, the exchanges confirmed changes rolled out quietly roughly a week ago when customers reported restrictions on lending-based services. Representatives from Huobi told CoinDesk that the exchange stopped its services two days ago, and that it will no longer offer margin trading on its China-facing website or its international alternative, BitYes. They also confirmed that Huobi was asked directly by the People's Bank of China (PBoC) to stop the services today, but that it had not previously heard from the central bank on the matter. This coincided with what appears to be a formal acknowledgement of findings circulated in China-based news outlets yesterday. According to The Wall Street Journal, the PBoC has issued a statement that reads: Yet, other exchange representatives sought to downplay the idea that the changes may be permanent. An exchange representative, who declined to be identified, called yesterday's news stories ""sourceless reporting"". ""This is informal guidance that is being interpreted as formal guidance,"" he said. Likewise, Huobi indicated it believes the guidance to be ""informal"", and that it may lack the weight of formal written guidance or a legally binding edict. As with other China-based exchanges, Huobi said it would continue to cooperate with the central bank and its requests Representatives from OKCoin could not be reached for official comment. Despite the formal acknowledgement of changes, exchange representatives seemed to push back against the idea that there was full clarity on how China's regulatory climate would move forward. In statements to Reuters, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee added that the PBoC's requests were ""not based on any official documentation"", and that the central bank has not issued an opinion that bitcoin margin trading is ""illegal"". Lee could not be reached for additional comment at press time. The representative from Huobi also suggested there remains a lack of clarity on how things will develop going forward. When asked if this meant that margin trading would end in China, she noted only that smaller exchanges had not been asked to end the practice. ""I just know regulators asked the three major exchanges to stop,"" she added. A representative from OKCoin, speaking privately, said that he believes it may be possible for margin trading to continue for international customers. OKCoin operates both a China-facing bitcoin exchange (OKCoin.cn) and an international website (OKCoin.com) that operates out of Hong Kong. ""You could have margin go away, or there might be a situation where Chinese people can't use it,"" he said. At press time, the price of bitcoin was up 0.5% on the day, suggesting the impending announcements were already priced in by market participants. Yet, there was a sense among some traders that any prolonged end to margin trading could have an impact on the global bitcoin market. Reports have suggested China accounts for as much as 95% of global trading, though other estimates peg this figure at the lower, but still dominant figure of 85%. China-based over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong suggested that there is a fear that reduced margin trading could impact exchange liquidity. Other traders expressed that they are still in ""wait and see"" mode, pending any formal statements from China's regulators. Mahjong image via Shutterstock

Specifically, the report concludes that the companies were found to be carrying out margin trading activities, though no details on any punishments were issued. The reports, by China-based news source Hexun and Jiefang Daily, further state that the platforms were also found to be operating outside of anti-money laundering rules, an area of concern the PBOC previously highlighted in public releases. It further moved to warn investors about the downside risks of purchasing bitcoin, a product considered under Chinese law to be a ""virtual good"". In statements, members of China's bitcoin community (perhaps unsurprisingly) sought to downplay the findings. Eric Zhao, an engineer at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, for instance, told CoinDesk that the result was ""to be expected"", even though he acknowledged that the reports do not provide much detail on what was discovered. China-based bitcoin mining firm founder Eric Mu, commented similarly, deriding the reports as ""nothing new"". The news comes nearly two weeks after reports first surfaced that the PBOC had held meetings with the exchanges, a development that followed a rapid increase in the price of bitcoin at the start of 2017. At press time, only BTCC had issued a formal response via its online Weibo account. ""BTCC will continue to actively cooperate with the central bank and its associated departments and carry out rectifications. BTCC is currently operating normally,"" the exchange said. CEO Bobby Lee would not confirm or deny any of the findings, but told CoinDesk that he is looking forward to the results of the report to determine how the market can best move forward in accordance with government guidance. He added: At time of press, bitcoin was down nearly 5% on the day's trading. PBOC image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's Price Breaks Out of Range to Reach $900                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-breaks-range-reach-900/," The price of bitcoin surged today, rising more than 9% and exceeding $900 for the first time in nearly a week. Average prices across exchanges breached this level at 17:45 UTC, rallying to as much as $906.38 by 20:00 UTC, the highest total observed since 11th January on CoinDesk's USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveals. Overall, bitcoin prices climbed into the low $900s after gaining more than $50 earlier in the session, rising to $896.75 by 08:15 UTC after opening at roughly $830. By climbing more than 9% during the session, bitcoin prices broke out of the relative calm they had enjoyed for several sessions, when the digital currency’s price repeatedly fluctuated between $800 and $840. Yet, under the surface, there have been changes in sentiment. Following the decisions by China's central bank, the People's Bank of China (PBoC), to meet with major exchanges last week, nobody knows for sure whether China’s central bank will take further action. Such uncertainty, it seems, has given way to positivity. ""It seems the PBOC is not going to do anything further damaging than limiting leverage,"" Kong Gao, marketing manager at China-based trading firm Richfund, told CoinDesk. Other China-based traders, when surveyed, acknowledged that there is a perception the central bank will take no further action. However, there were signs that the absence of any news has given way to speculation. Rik Willard, founder and manager of Agentic Group, for example, theorized that the wider belief that the PBoC's actions may have been a way of the bank testing its market influence. ""If I were the Chinese government, I'd be testing the power that my words (regulatory or otherwise) have over the global marketplace,"" he said. Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, emphasized that traders are less confident than usual, a statement that is backed up by Whaleclub data showing the market is 78% long. This compares to the three weeks through 4th January, when the market was at least 90% long during nearly every session. He noted how this nervousness makes the recent rally vulnerable, concluding: Break open door via Shutterstock

                            Estimating China's Real Bitcoin Trading Volumes                        ",Willy Woo,https://www.coindesk.com/estimating-data-china-real-bitcoin-trading-volumes/,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast. In this guest feature, Woo takes aim at the prevailing notion that China's bitcoin markets account for 98% of trading, suggesting that the real number is closer to 80%.  Today, China's exchanges report 98% of global volume, a figure that would suggest a huge dominance by its markets. Unfortunately, we know that most of this volume is fake. Unlike the rest of the world, China-based exchanges are unique in that they do not charge fees on bitcoin trades. Instead they make money via withdrawal charges out of the exchange. Further, these fees reduce as your trading volume increases, so this incentivizes traders to bolster this figure by buying and selling from themselves at zero cost. Still, there's a ocean of data coming from the markets, and they hold hidden secrets. In this study, I'll peer into the data and attempt (as far as I know) the first estimate of true China-based volumes using data driven methods. For this post, I'll define ""true volume"" as what the volumes would have been, had the exchanges charged a trading fee. Prior estimates (really just educated guesses) have put Chinese volumes at 50% of the global market. Let's see how well this compares with the data. To begin, we must remember that China was not always a zero-fee market.  BTCC, the first China-based exchange, started with 0.3% fees on trades. Likewise the second Chinese exchange, OKCoin, initially charged 0.3%. Then, on 24th September 2013, BTCC instigated what was to be a three-month experiment in zero fees. This started an arms race between all the domestic exchanges, heralding in an era of zero fees from which China has never returned. But, how do we know the effect this had on volumes?  For one, there was an immediate spike. Expressed as a ratio to non-Chinese volume, it went from 17% to well over 100% in barely six weeks. This visualization is useful in one other aspect. We can see China's exchange volume growth was steadily increasing at a predictable rate (of about 4% week on week) before the introduction of zero fees. This becomes our first tool to estimate true volume, as we can use this steady growth to extrapolate what volumes may have been like had this trend continued. Now, there is one market in China where the volumes have never been faked, LocalBitcoins, a decentralized marketplace where buyers and sellers connect and trade. Here’s what its volumes look like:  LocalBitcoins was founded in June 2012, and you can see it gained traction rapidly. By Q4 2013, we can see it began tracking global on-exchange volumes quite well. The exchange is also available in many countries globally, meaning each market has a ratio between “on the streets” volume and what volume their local online exchange is doing. This ratio differs depending on local conditions, but the two will track each over over time. This will be our second tool in our estimation strategy. We can use LocalBitcoin's volume to show local market demand, and scale it up to estimate exchange volumes. We are now ready to reconstruct real Chinese exchange volume. The historical estimates has three phases: The final composite looks like this:  From this composite, we can reconstruct the true global market volume. Here's the estimated true volume vs the reported volume. The differences are significant: ￼ Expressed as Chinese marketshare of global exchange volume, it looks like this: ￼ Expressed as a ratio of fake volumes to true volumes, it looks like this:  Yes, it's been almost 40x overreported at times. Previous educated guesses have put the real marketshare at 50%, but the data implies it's much higher, around 85%. China is still the dominant players controlling bitcoin volume, but not nearly as dominant as reported volumes suggest, about 10-40x less dominant, depending on the week. Data from CoinDesk Research, for example, based on publicly available data, indicates the reported figure to be 95%. It's also worth mentioning that exchange volume doesn't make up as much of global bitcoin trade as one might assume. The exchanges may set the prices, but most of the volume happens off exchanges in over-the-counter trades, so true globally traded volume is (supposedly) hidden. Using similar methods to these here, I can probably make an estimate of OTC trade, but I'll leave that to another day. Visit Woo's blog to read more cryptocurrency markets coverage.

Though Coinbase has been allowed to serve New York customers under a safe-harbor provision while the application process was being conducted, the formal award of the so-called ""BitLicense"" solidifies the exchange's operating status. Coming at a time when the exchange has been waging what could be an expensive legal battle with the IRS to protect its customer data, the license is being described as a ""validation"" of Coinbase’s aim to be compliant with regulatory considerations. Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong said in a statement: The license was granted after a ""comprehensive"" review of Coinbase’s anti-money laundering, capitalization, consumer protection and cybersecurity policies, according to a statement provided to CoinDesk by the NYDFS. The company will be subject to ongoing supervision by the regulator. San Franscico-based Coinbase is one of the most heavily funded startups in the industry, having raised $117m in venture capital. Formally released in June 2015, the BitLicense was designed to provide a framework for companies looking to custody bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies for their customers or trade the cryptocurrency. However, after an initial 22 applications were sent in, the controversial license proved too expensive for many startups. In fact, this is only the third BitLicense to be awarded to date, with multiple applications have been denied. In September 2015, Boston-based Circle was granted the first BitLicense, though by December 2016 the company had pivoted away from its bitcoin exchange to focus more on payments. Last July, San Francisco-based Ripple was awarded the second BitLicense. In addition to the BitLicense, the NYDFS has granted banking charters to bitcoin startups Gemini Trust Company and itBit Trust Company.

                            Miami's Third Bitcoin Hackathon Was All (OK, Mostly) Fun And Games                        ",Ariel Deschapell,https://www.coindesk.com/miami-bitcoin-hackathon-fun-games/," Gamification took center stage at the third annual Miami Bitcoin Hackathon this week, with the first place winner demonstrating a Pokemon Go-inspired, location-based game that earned its team a 15 BTC grand prize. Using GPS and BLE technology, the BitTag app facilitates virtual games of ""tag"" based on distance, rewarding players with small amounts of bitcoin while enabling local business exposure. The team consisted of seasoned developers who impressed with their ability to ship a working prototype. Members included David Hartmann, Emanuel Guerrero, Rob Doischen, Ryan Pineo and Vasilii Muravev. Discussing the effort, Hartmann, team lead and CEO of development firm The SilverLogic, told CoinDesk: Judges included Bitstop ATM co-founder Doug Carillo; Bitcoin Uncensored co-host Joshua Unseth; Satoshi Labs CEO Alena Vranova; Breadwallet CMO Aaron Lasher; and local developer and tech educator Nelson Milian. The focus on making bitcoin easier to use was common among hackathon attendees. Second-place winner Coinbar, for example, demoed an app that enables the querying of various types of bitcoin data using the unique interface of the new Macbook Pro Touch Bar. The finished prototype could also be used to set price alerts, and the team plans on even adding on-chain bitcoin transactions to the app's future functionality. Breadwallet's Aaron Lasher noted its potentially addictive appeal and remarked, ""I can see myself just messing around with this all the time."" Other strong showings in gamification included Swolebit, which uses wearable technologies to track fitness stats, and help users achieve daily goals by rewarding or penalizing them with small bitcoin rewards depending on performance. Elsewhere, Crypto Ranks perhaps attempted to take the idea of gamification the farthest by building a first-person shooter using an open-source gaming engine and assets. Designed as a type of onramp for gamers attempting to enter the professional circuit, the game deducts a small amount of bitcoin for every shot fired in a multiplayer match and places it in a pot. At the end of the round the top performer wins the pot. While the prototype was unfinished and unable to place, judges and notable attendees expressed interest in the unique dynamics the incentives of the game would create. While a major focus of the event was adoption through ""fun and simple"" gamification, others continued to focus on solving hard problems through the unique functionality made possible with bitcoin's underlying technology. Setbounty won third place doing just this with a Chrome app that interfaces with GitHub to allow users to place bounties for features and bug fixes in open-source projects. Users can also set bounties for the same tickets, aggregating the funds and incentivizing developers to focus on the most in-demand requests while rewarding them for their effort. Like BitTag, the Setbounty team consisted of full-time development firm co-workers, in this case, a team that had previously won first place at the Miami Hackathon. ""Originally, we wanted to build it using a system of smart contracts… but that was pretty ambitious,"" remarked team lead and CEO of Setmusic Jesus Najera. ""With the current prototype, we're the middlemen, but the goal is still to build this out as a totally decentralized bounty system for developers."" Fourth place winner Rigid sought to use bitcoin's secure and time-tested blockchain to tackle the clinical trial industry, which consists of a labyrinth of consent and other legal paperwork. The prototype aims to allow easy proof of record using the blockchain to streamline the paper trail and organization of records. Another notable entrant included Quick VPN which sought to purchase VPN uptime in bulk and sell it to users for flexible custom slots of time, say 15 minutes, in exchange for the exact proportional amount of bitcoin and a small fee. But, if the event lacked for anything, it wasn’t lack of creativity. Ask a room full of developers and bitcoin enthusiasts what the ecosystem's biggest challenges are and you'll get many answers, and even more possible solutions. Attendee Austin Alexander, an employee at bitcoin exchange service said it best when he remarked: Perhaps more essential to the growth of the bitcoin ecosystem than any one project or potential ""killer app"" then, is the combined efforts of many entrepreneurs and developers of different backgrounds contributing in their own small ways. While it tends to be the fun projects that attract the attention and win the prizes, they can also distract from much more basic problems which continue to persist. That was the goal of long-time enthusiast Kyle Kemper and his BitHedge team: ""For people just getting into bitcoin there’s always this question of 'How much bitcoin should I buy?', and the standard response is always, 'However much you're willing to lose'. The problem with that answer is that it immediately frames things in a negative light, and doesn't give the newcomer anything actionable to do,"" he said. Kemper's entry, Bithedge, asked users to enter their current or desired net worth, finding the equivalent amount of bitcoin needed to own the same percentage of total bitcoin wealth. ""It’s a pretty good and achievable starting point,"" Kemper said. Still, there was a feeling that the diversity in approach inspired by events such as the Miami Bitcoin Hackathon ensures that many paths are taken and use cases attempted. Surely, this is a vital need for such a new and nascent technology, one where success may come from anywhere and everywhere. Image via BitcoinsVendor via Twitter

                            UAE 'Virtual Currency' Restrictions Cast Uncertain Shadow on Bitcoin                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/uae-virtual-currency-restrictions-cast-uncertain-shadow-bitcoin/," While the world waits to see how the People’s Bank of China moves to regulate bitcoin and digital currencies, another central bank is quietly putting its own rules in place. The Central Bank of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) released a new regulatory framework earlier this month, aimed at providing a basis for the development of a new digital payments ecosystem as part of a broader modernization drive. The framework, published on 1st January, applies to companies that offer withdrawals and deposits to payment accounts, debit and credit services (both retail and government), remittances and peer-to-peer payments. Yet, buried in the text of the framework is the stipulation that ""all virtual currencies (and any transactions thereof) are prohibited"" for businesses that fall under these categories. In the framework, virtual currencies are defined as ""any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account or a form of stored value"", excluding loyalty points and other similar digital products. To be sure, the UAE central bank’s steps aren’t as direct as the ones taken by the PBoC, which has met with bitcoin exchange representatives in recent days and intends to scrutinize exchanges more closely. But the framework indicates that applicable payment service providers (PSPs) in the UAE are prohibited from handling or conducting digital currency transactions – echoing, in some ways, a statement from the PBoC in 2013. On the other hand, sources in the region say the wording of the framework leaves it open to interpretation by central bank officials who have broad latitude over the movements of money within the UAE. Simply put, it’s not entirely clear at this time how far-reaching the decision may be, and such clarity will come only when the central bank begins to put the rules into practice on a case-by-case basis. Sally Sfeir-Tait, a partner for Clyde & Co, who has a special focus on regulatory issues in the region, told CoinDesk: The central bank release comes after months of growing momentum for blockchain tech in the region, both in the public and private sectors. A state-backed development effort in Dubai has attracted particular interest as officials look to digitize a range of government sources, though the non-financial nature of those projects suggests that they will fall outside the scope of the UAE central bank’s framework. According to at least one observer, the move didn’t come as a shock. Raza Rizvi, a counsel for Simmons & Simmons, who specializes in the region, said that the move fits with its ""regulatory style"". Indeed, sources say that the central bank’s prohibition is in line with a stance that errs on the side of caution when it comes to financial monitoring. ""While governments have a palpable excitement about the underlying technology and are 'digitally awake', they are not so comfortable with the absence of central control that comes with cryptocurrencies,"" Rizvi told CoinDesk. Sfeir-Tait suggested that, in this case, the central bank's actions are largely in line with its mandate as the UAE’s chief monetary watchdog. ""At the end of the day, the central bank's main objective is financial and monetary stability, and that’s how they’d be looking at it,"" she said. But what about those businesses that could be potentially affected? Ola Doudin, CEO of bitcoin exchange startup BitOasis, highlighted to CoinDesk that the regulation ""is specific to companies that fall under the new PSP licensing"", meaning startups like hers aren't affected. Moving further, there are only a handful of startups operating in the region, with Doudin's being a rare one to focus on the bitcoin blockchain. ""To date there is still no clear regulatory framework for digital currency companies and exchanges locally and regionally,"" Doudin said, adding: The full UAE regulatory framework release can be found below: Regulatory Framework for Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems En by CoinDesk on Scribd

                            Bitcoin Tranquility Continues as Prices Remain in $800 Range                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-tranquility-prices-800-range/," Bitcoin prices have thus far enjoyed a day of reasonably tranquil price movements. During today’s session, the digital currency fluctuated between $820 and $835, having fallen to as little as $820.05 at 12:15 UTC and risen to as much as $834.70 at 02:15 UTC, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The lack of volatility that bitcoin prices have seen thus far today coincides with a broader trend, as bitcoin prices have been moving between $800 and $840 since late last week. The average price is currently $828.82, BPI data shows. Traders have been watching the markets with suspense and waiting to see what steps the People’s Bank of China (PBoC), the country's central bank, will pursue after it held meetings with major Chinese exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin earlier this month. The PBoC later pledged to keep a closer eye on the ecosystem. Those exchanges have already gone on to revise their margin trading practices, reigning in market participants’ use of leverage to enhance their trading. Now, traders are standing back and waiting to see whether China’s central bank takes any additional action. “We’re all waiting to see whether the PBoC does anything serious,"" said Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM.

                            Masters-Backed Hedge Fund: Greed and Leverage Broke Bitcoin's Rally                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/masters-backed-hedge-fund-greed-leverage-broke-bitcoins-rally/,"The bitcoin price may be stuck in the $800s for some time, a new investor note from Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment (GABI) argues. Published today, the note finds one of the technology's more well-known hedge funds (led by ex-JP Morgan trader Daniel Masters) asserting that the market is ""temporarily broken"" after rising to near all-time highs of more than $1,100 at the start of 2017. Overall, the firm projects that bitcoin's price is likely to continue to be volatile, and that further gains could remain elusive due to the uncertainty that it expects in the aftermath of the decline. The note reads: It continues: ""In short, the price isn’t going anywhere fast."" That said, GABI is bullish on digital currency as an asset class long term. Of note is that it believes there is the possibility bitcoin could see another breakout in 2017, with a ruling on a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) snapping the market out of the doldrums. As reported last year, the SEC is expected to rule on two applications, one by the New York-based investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, the other by New York-based startup SolidX, as soon as this March. GABI goes on to suggest that its buyers accumulate bitcoin in advance of the expected rulings, and to establish long positions for when the time comes. ""There is room for a considerable upside during the last three quarters,"" the note reads. The findings follow a separate note from investment banking and asset management firm Needham & Co, which contends that the Winklevoss filing has a less than 25% chance of being approved. Still, it projected that an approval would be a boon for the market, attracting as much as $300m in capital in the first week of trading alone. Yet, the note was also critical of a bitcoin market it identified as still insufficient for the needs of an expanding investor base. According to the note, bitcoin traders should have been aware that the market was in for what it termed an ""impending collapse"" due to what it framed as the industry's acceptance of out-of-control leveraged trading. The note goes on to break down offerings from both BitMEX, a Hong Kong-based leveraged trading specialist and Beijing-based OKCoin, one of the world's largest bitcoin exchange firms, noting the disparities between the two models. Overall, it pointed to a lack of standardization as a culprit, noting that exchanges offer ""divergent funding rates"" that are often based on little more than the risk tolerance of its users. It also painted the wider market as one that was forcing investors to consider bitcoin due to the possibility of large returns. ""Chinese investors and speculators – who are faced, as previously noted many times, with weak domestic currency, stocks, credit and commodity markets – turned to bitcoin as a non-correlated investment and speculative opportunity,"" it reads.

                            UK Exchange Coinfloor Embraces 'No-Fee' Bitcoin Trading                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/uk-exchange-coinfloor-embraces-no-fee-bitcoin-trading/,"London-based digital currency exchange Coinfloor has announced it will adopt a 'no-fee' bitcoin trading policy beginning later this week. With the move, Coinfloor, one of the larger players in bitcoin's still nascent GBP market, embraces a pricing strategy that is comparable to the industry's largest, though primarily China-based exchanges, which have long withheld fees on bitcoin-denominated trades. Speaking to CoinDesk, exchange representatives indicated that the move is designed to boost liquidity at the exchange, the largest GBP bitcoin trading platform by volume, according to data from Bitcoinity. The exchange sees just over 630 BTC (roughly $425,000) in GBP/BTC trades daily, a figure that puts it ahead of competitors in the market including Coinbase's GDAX exchange and San Francisco-based Kraken. Yet, Coinfloor founder Mark Lamb said that he believes Western exchanges shouldn't be afraid to follow the more ""innovative"" policies adopted globally. Lamb told CoinDesk: The news is notable given that in recent weeks, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin, the world's three largest exchanges, have been increasingly active in engaging with the People's Bank of China, the country's central bank. So far, this interaction has seen the exchanges adjust policies on lending-based margin trading, though volume figures appear unaffected, returning to averages seen before the price neared an all-time high earlier this month. However, Lamb stopped short of saying that the move was designed to capitalize on recent uncertainty surrounding China-based exchanges. ""This is about growing the trading activity in the UK rather than taking away activity from other regions,"" he said. Coinfloor said it will continue to charge for bitcoin withdrawals, as well as GBP deposits and withdrawals. Old-style cash register via Shutterstock

                            Blockchain 'Bullies': Truth, Trolls and Bitcoin Uncensored's Big Short                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-bullies-truth-trolling-bitcoin-uncensoreds-big-short/," ""I’ve been sending death threats since I was 8."" I know a lead-in like that piques interest and so does Chris DeRose, one half of the abrasive and influential podcast 'Bitcoin Uncensored'. It’s why he said it. That, and to make his co-host and partner in alleged crime, Joshua Unseth, laugh. “Sometimes the most honest thing you can do is tell a lie,” Unseth adds. That statement should cloud everything you’re about to read. First, a brief introduction. For those who aren’t familiar, Bitcoin Uncensored is a loosely defined podcast that’s part constant Soundcloud experimentation and part social media barrage. While maybe nothing on its own, ‘BU’ has coalesced into a (mostly) cohesive (and controversial) flavor of bitcoin intellectualism – one that is at once a rejection of the technology’s earlier Libertarian values and a supposed embrace of its more scientific merits. That's not to say DeRose and Unseth think differently than the bitcoin maximalists of 2013, it's just that they’ve developed a new way to espouse the message. Their claim to fame is that they tout this in a rather tasteless and increasingly offensive and visible way. (The duo was ranked number nine in our year's-end, ""most influential"" reader poll). To many, though, the vote shone a brighter light on their more unsavory actions. They’ve been called misogynists, racists, anti-Semites and homophobes by the most well-known faces in the industry. (Many of whom refused to go on record about the subject). Before we continue, we'll want to bear in mind this juxtaposition. To understand DeRose and Unseth, one must also understand bitcoin evangelists, a group that for years now has either been getting made fun of or ignored by most everyone that's not a 'believer'. Traditional financial institutions, large enterprises, venture capitalists – most have bowed out for a tangential industry, 'blockchain'. And it’s this buzzword that has emerged as the central focal point of the BU universe. The problem, according to DeRose and Unseth, is that none of the bitcoin haters seem to know what a 'blockchain' is. That, and because it’s being used as a buzzword to secure funding rounds at the expense of the innovators who created it. (And they're not alone in this claim.) To some, DeRose and Unseth have become something of a mascot for this crusade. And to those who are opposed, they’ve become another name on their Twitter block list. In the middle of this tug-of-war are the critics who allege that DeRose and Unseth instigate nothing more than bullying and harassment (and that acknowledging them at all amounts to ""letting them win""). And there's plenty of evidence to back this up. This article by blog Bitcoinist highlights some of the more colorful and unfriendly words they've used for notable investor-backed projects, including Zcash and thought leaders like Andreas Antonopoulos. In interview, DeRose didn’t see to have a firm stance on whether or not his actions constitute ‘trolling’. This is despite admitting to making harassing phone calls to people’s family members and creating (or encouraging) lewd gifs and memes that lampoon industry figures. Indeed, DeRose seems unable to see the human cost of these actions, preferring to emphasize his seeming belief that any engagement in the industry amounts to an entrance ticket into a kind of prolonged intellectual warfare. “I don’t know what trolling is anymore,” DeRose told CoinDesk. “Is any peer review trolling now? Is anything that is meaningful now considered trolling?"" In his mind, this is what allows him to say, criticize someone's appearance in a sexualized way, or attend an industry conference in disguise and antagonize its organizers. ""What I’ve worked hard for is to have a culture where people are evaluated by their ideas and not as people,"" he adds. In some ways, this is historically how the bitcoin and blockchain space has interacted with outsiders (see the development community’s sprawling mailing list and Twitter arguments, as evidence). Conflict definitely garners attention. DeRose and Unseth have even acknowledged the accusations about their behavior on their show, though when they do it's often dismissive. In response to the topic of subjective morality on a recent show, DeRose quipped ""I don't think there's anything worse than that."" The conversation quickly routs through discussion of the bible, sex crimes and how confrontation is sometimes the only way to make people face thought paradoxes they may not have previously considered. And as some of their favorite public targets have struggled – banks leaving the R3CEV private blockchain consortium, scammers running away with the money raised by initial coin offerings and The DAO hack and subsequent ethereum hardfork – the two have earned a kind of niche celebrity in the industry for forcing the conversation. Even their critics are increasingly acknowledging a difficult truth – they may be partly right. Jae Kwon, founder and CEO of the open-source blockchain platform Tendermint, has been in the line of fire of DeRose and Unseth before, but he’s more level-headed about the antagonism. Despite being the butt of some of their jokes, he said he shares some of the chagrin that their sprawling podcasts and social media firepower have helped give voice to. ""I’m also frustrated by some of the things coming out of this industry under the umbrella of blockchain,"" Kwon said. ""The core of what they’re saying has a lot of truth to it."" He credits the rise of Unseth and DeRose to the anonymity afforded by the Internet itself, one that he said has created ""subculture where trolling is promoted as the method by which one arrives at the truth"". And in the bitcoin space it's only secured by the mythos surrounding the cryptocurrency’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, plus most supporter's belief that technology can usurp social problems. If you have good technologically sound ideas, then it doesn’t matter who you are as a person, right? But sometimes it does matter, because there are more effective ways of changing the right people’s minds than via condescension and humiliation. ""The approach they take – bullying and trolling – and their criteria, any proof-of-stake blockchain or fundraiser is a scam, are toxic and flawed,"" he said. Kwon’s Tendermint co-founder, Ethan Buchman, agrees. ""I suspect much of their effectiveness is lost due to the tactics,"" Buchman said. To understand where this sentiment comes from, however, one has to go back to the most influential ‘Bitcoin Uncensored’ episode, featuring Perianne Boring, founder and president of the non-profit Chamber of Digital Commerce. Today, the narrative has been reduced to something like this – DeRose and Unseth coaxed Boring into appearing on the show to talk about blockchain. There, she, in the midst of forceful questioning, conceded that it was basically like the SWIFT secure financial messaging service, a comment the pair immediately and harshly criticized. Their point was essentially this: if blockchain is just like SWIFT, what would be the point of luring banks into spending vast amounts of time and money stripping their architecture? For many though, it wasn’t what was said, but how it was carried out (as well as subsequent discussion that found them emphasizing her physical appearance). On the audio, you can even hear how DeRose and Unseth know full well that they’re prepared to rip apart her ideas. ""She didn’t learn anything from it because she was immediately put on the defensive. It was great for their ratings, but if they actually want her [and others] to learn something or have a positive impact, they need another approach,"" Buchman said. Sure, you could say that standing on a soapbox and patronizing people isn’t always effective – but then again, the latest US election would just about prove you wrong. On a larger, sociological level, DeRose and Unseth have simply borrowed from President-Elect Donald Trump’s playbook. Stoke animosity, attack political correctness and the crowd goes wild. This can also be seen broadly in the many pro-bitcoin Twitter accounts that routinely retweet Trump rhetoric, unbecoming memes and other incendiary online content. Unseth's former Twitter description, for instance, claims, ""If you support me and @derosetech [Chris], then you also support @realDonaldTrump."" Part of the script is to willingly give ammunition to the haters. They know that defending themselves against trolls is a lost cause, because well, they play that game. The duo's most ardent supports liken them to something like venerated court jesters, there to prove, as one blogger put, that the emperors have no clothes. ""The bottom line is  –  any community that wants to evolve past bad habits and toxic over-optimistic utopian thinking will have to face ridicule and humor. Because it is often only when we speak in jest, that we are truly saying the truth,"" Plutus.it's Filip Martinka wrote. Others, like bitcoin developer Paul Storzc, use even more vaunted historical terms: The argument goes like this: So, what if Unseth (who's not light-skinned) says he doesn’t like people of color, hasn't his belief that bitcoin is the only blockchain with a circular economy promoted interest in how this might be successfully replicated? And who cares if DeRose brags about his love of escorts? His position that bitcoin is supported by regulatory arbitrage (the idea that government rules and restrictions give the blockchain its usefulness) is now a de-facto phrase. But many do care, just like they care about President-Elect Trump’s inflammatory rhetoric. Because the way people in power act and speak gives others an example, an excuse to act in the same way. In interview, Unseth and DeRose display a certain cockiness that can be palpable as well. Their worst quality, interruption – not only in the interview but at conferences (where they’ll lampoon speakers with question after question) – can be grating. Still, their passive aggressive questions and satirical statements are, many times, on point. And while they cast themselves as imbeciles, heroin addicts and 'johns', it’s only to mask real concern. ""The secret truth is that we actually care about bitcoiners,"" DeRose said. Finally, a moment of clarity in an interview that all-too-often digresses into a swirl of jokes. To some, DeRose and Unseth are already sympathetic due to their 'outsider' status. According to Toni Lane Casserly, partner at BitNation, a blockchain-powered ""decentralized borderless voluntary nation"", it's best to view their offensive, in-your-face tendencies as a result of emotional baggage that they carry around. ""They were placed in situations where people didn’t value them, where they were treated like they weren’t good enough or smart enough, and the way they’ve dealt with that is through humor,"" she said. In some instances, though, it's hard to laugh. As the saying goes, there’s a fine line between clever and stupid, and Bitcoin Uncensored certainly likes to cross that line. At stake in the whole narrative is the question of who is the real bully. Is it the hordes of bitcoin enthusiasts on Twitter who lampoon and attack their intellectual opponents in anonymity? Or is it the businesses and conferences that all too often lock out this dialogue for a PC or 'business-friendly' environment? In this light, one would be remiss not to mention the central characters of ""The Big Short"", another set of outsiders who were attacked and ridiculed, only to be proven right. A core intellectual question here is, as Unseth and DeRose allude to, which is the greater harm? ""When we started doing this show, it was obvious where the space was going. To us 2+2=4 and then there were a bunch of people in the space claiming that 2+2=15,"" Unseth said. It could be argued that both parties are guilty for the poor state of the dialogue. But then, there’s that line again. After all, I'm still here trying to figure out if the pair sends death threats to blockchain industry entrepreneurs, when DeRose finally admits to the action. Unseth quickly jumps to his defense. At its core, its this kind of camaraderie that is also key to their appeal. ""It’s interesting, though, because these guys are known scammers,"" he says, alluding that I’m trusting the wrong people. ""I don’t mean to disrespect; just trying to validate,"" I said. DeRose quickly strikes back: Image via Bitcoin Uncensored

                            Bitcoin Price Fluctuations Calm Amid Chinese Regulatory Suspense                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-fluctuations-calmed-chinese-regulatory-suspense/,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 7th through 13th January.  Bitcoin prices experienced significant volatility for much of this week, calming down during the last few sessions. Amid these fluctuations, the digital currency’s price rose to as much as $942.06 on 8th January and declined to $752.11 on 11th January before trading between reasonably tight ranges for most of the week’s remainder, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI).  Market analysts cited ongoing Chinese regulatory developments – and the resulting suspense they have been creating for market observers – as driving this week’s bitcoin price movements. Rik Willard, founder and managing director of Agentic Group LLC, framed the situation thus: At least for now, the uncertainty surrounding Chinese regulation has once more taken center stage in the world of bitcoin trading. These ongoing regulatory developments were first credited with provoking notable uncertainty and significant price volatility in bitcoin. In recent weeks, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) has held meetings with representatives of bitcoin exchanges Huobi, BTCC and OKCoin, announcing 6th January that it had provided these exchanges with warnings. Bitcoin prices suffered consequent volatility, falling more than 10% on the day of the announcement. The suspense created by the news continued to fuel intense price fluctuations, as bitcoin surged above $940 on 8th January before plunging to as little as $878.10 the following session. On 11th January, bitcoin prices dropped to $752.11 – their lowest since 2nd December and a more than 40% drop from the recent high of $1,153.02 reached on 5th January, BPI figures reveal. When explaining this decline, some analysts stated that the Chinese government’s efforts to more closely monitor the nation’s bitcoin industry were creating significant anxiety for traders. While bitcoin prices experienced several days of volatility, these sharp fluctuations seemed to calm somewhat from 12th January, at which point the digital currency began trading within the relatively modest range of $745 to $775. Bitcoin prices broke out of that range about halfway through the session, but even then, their volatility was limited, as the digital currency failed to reach $830 on either 12th or 13th January. When explaining the reduced volatility, more than one analyst stated that market participants had taken a step back to wait and see what would happen. Arthur Hayes, CEO and co-founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX, told CoinDesk that the market was in a state of “suspense” as it waited to see what action the PBoC would take in regards to the major Chinese exchanges. He speculated that the central bank would both eliminate margin trading at these exchanges and “require a minimum fee to be charged on all trades.” Hayes speculated that these moves would lessen speculator interest in bitcoin. Bitcoin traders got their first piece of clarity on 13th January, when BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi quietly revised their margin trading policies. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, told CoinDesk that his exchange made these changes after receiving guidance from the central bank. While Hayes spoke to the potential negative impact that such changes could have on bitcoin markets, some analysts seemed more optimistic about the situation. “There has been a relative calm over the market since the PBoC news was released,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategy. Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, provided similar sentiment, telling CoinDesk: While some analysts have expressed concerns about how the looming possibility of new regulations might be creating anxiety for traders, Kong Gao, oversea marketing manager for Richfund, took a different tack. “The creation of regulations will more likely benefit the industry than hamper it,” he told CoinDesk. “We are already seeing this happening. BTCC has just announced that they had stopped providing leverage and other exchanges will likely follow suit.” He elaborated on the situation's foreseeable costs and benefits, stating: “We will likely experience a price decline, but bitcoin's volatility will be reduced. Reduced volatility, combined with a stamp of approval from PBoC with regulation, will likely positively contribute to bitcoin's adoption in China and elsewhere.” Zivkovski took a similar view, saying: The reduced use of margin should lower the incidence of long and short squeezes, he emphasized, which should reduce volatility.

In a statement published yesterday by the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the regulator warned that potential investors should ""exercise extreme caution"" in light of radio advertisements and other sales pitches made for OneCoin, bitcoin and types of digital currencies. The agency said in a statement: Nigeria's SEC went on to state that in some cases, those promoting the aforementioned advertisement may be conducting wholly fraudulent enterprises. ""The public should also be aware that any investment opportunities promoted by these persons, companies or entities are likely to be of a risky nature with a high risk of loss of money, whilst others may be outright fraudulent pyramid schemes,"" the statement read. The timing is perhaps unsurprising, given recent developments. Earlier this month, the controversial Ponzi scheme system MMM announced that it would reopen its doors in Nigeria, telling prospective users that it would introduce bitcoin as a form of payment, according to a report from Quartz. OneCoin – which has widely accused of operating a fraudulent Ponzi scheme and has been targeted by other regulatory warnings and investigations – also does business in Nigeria. Nigerian authorities have previously called for improved regulation of digital currency in the country. In mid-2015, Okwu Nnanna of the Central Bank of Nigeria advocated for the creation of new rules to prevent potential money laundering arising from use of the tech. Nigeria image via Shutterstock

According to a statement published on 11th January, the Israel Tax Authority (ITA) said that it would consider bitcoin and other digital currencies as a kind of intangible asset rather than a foreign currency. Profits would then be taxed at the capital gains rate, which in Israel begins at 25%. The agency said in a translated statement: Individuals involved in the sale or mining of digital currencies would be subject to business tax rates. Further, any commercial sales of bitcoin or transactions involved with trading are subject to value-added tax (VAT), the agency said. The release comes more than three years after word first emerged that Israel would seek some degree of taxation on bitcoin transactions. In late 2013, officials from the tax agency were quoted as saying that they wanted to pursue a means of taxing profits on bitcoin sales, but that they were uncertain on how to do so. The move echoes the decision made by US tax authorities in 2014, when it moved to classify bitcoin as a type of taxable property. Image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin: This is Not the Same as 2013                        ",Chris Burniske,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-not-2013/,"Chris Burniske is blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive innovation and co-author of the new white paper, ""Bitcoin, a New Asset Class"". In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Burniske pushes back on the mainstream media, arguing that the idea bitcoin is merely repeating the infamy of 2013 is misinformed.  A common but mistaken refrain is building that bitcoin's behavior of late has been a replica of the infamous late 2013 rise and crash. Certainly, a similar narrative could be spun: bitcoin breaks $1,000, the People's Bank of China issues some comments that scare people, bitcoin crashes. But if a few marketplace characteristics are investigated, I think the difference in bitcoin's maturity between then and now becomes clear. On 5th December, 2013, a short while after bitcoin broke $1,000, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) sent out a statement claiming bitcoin was ""not a currency in the real meaning of the word"". The PBOC went on to restrict financial institutions from getting further involved with the technology. Last week, on 6th January, 2017, a short while after bitcoin broke $1,000 for the second time in its eight-year life, the PBOC sent out new statements indicating that its representatives had met with major China-based bitcoin exchanges to reinforce the importance of remaining compliant with ""relevant laws and regulations."" The tenor of the statements was markedly different, but let’s focus on the numbers. Following both announcements, bitcoin quickly fell below $1,000, which is what has led to the false proclamation that bitcoin hasn’t changed a bit since 2013. I believe such a proclamation is born of ignorance around the specific market dynamics. As shown below, the daily percent changes in bitcoin's price both leading up to the PBOC announcement, and after the announcement, have not been nearly as severe as they were in 2013. On the X-axis of the graph is a metric called, 'Days Removed from People’s Bank of China Announcement'. In other words, the zero point for 2013 is 5th December, while for 2017 it's 6th January: those are the days when the PBOC announcements went public. ""-60"" is sixty days before the PBOC announcement, in each respective year. Taking the standard deviation of these daily percent price changes yields one of the most common metrics for volatility, as shown below. In 2013, the volatility in the 60 days leading up to the PBOC announcement was more than 3x the volatility preceding the PBOC announcement in 2017. The volatility in the week after was twice as great in 2013, as well.  It appears, however, that some bitcoin investors are suffering PTSD. After all, the 2013 announcement precipitated a long slide in bitcoin’s price through 2014, bottoming in January 2015. Such fear may explain why volatility on a relative basis jumped more after the recent announcement than it did in 2013. In other words, in 2013 the volatility roughly doubled after the PBOC announcement, while this year it has roughly tripled. That said, volatility after the PBOC announcement this time around is still less than the volatility before the PBOC announcement in 2013. Critics have come out of the woodwork recently, many once again proclaiming bitcoin is too volatile for most portfolios. However, if an investor has held Twitter, LinkedIn, Workday, Netflix, GoPro, Tableau and many more high-flying tech names over the last few years, then they have endured single day drops greater than bitcoin has experienced over the last week. I think bitcoin's subdued volatility in the face of fears over China is a sign of its maturing markets. For instance, liquidity has improved considerably, with global trading volumes roughly 30x greater than they were in late 2013. Meanwhile, it appears a more informed base of investors now has the conviction to hold through the whims of nation-states, picking up the slack from weak hands. Yet, at the moment, bitcoin may not be stable enough to be a currency. Its price swings are still great enough that they could cause havoc if bitcoin was a broadly used unit of account (and they do wreak havoc on other cryptocurrencies, where bitcoin is often used as the unit of account). Furthermore, changes in bitcoin’s price make it harder to use bitcoin as a means of exchange, because significant exchange rate risk can arise. But, if bitcoin is a new asset class — as I've put forth in paper authored with Coinbase — then it doesn’t need to behave like other assets we already know in order to gain mainstream adoption. I think it just needs to mature, and signs are that it’s doing just that. Old phone, new phone image via Shutterstock

                            China's Bitcoin Exchanges Quietly Made Policy Updates Overnight                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/china-bitcoin-exchanges-trading-policy-updates/,"China's major bitcoin exchanges halted, or otherwise updated, their lending-based bitcoin trading services today. First reported by China-based bitcoin traders and market observers this morning, BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin appear to have quietly adjusted their terms, though only BTCC had moved to issue a formal comment confirming the changes. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, acknowledged that changes to the exchange's service were being made in response to interactions with the People's Bank of China, the country’s central bank, though he stopped short of saying that the service had been terminated or disabled. Lee indicated that the move came after the exchange received ""informal guidance"" from the PBoC, which has been more actively engaged with domestic bitcoin exchanges amid the run-up in bitcoin prices seen at the start of the year. The developments followed news that central bank officials had met with representatives from the exchanges. Lee told CoinDesk: At press time, BTCC is the only exchange to explain the changes in a message posted to its website. ""BTCC will [suspend loans and borrowing services] from 12th January, 2017,"" it reads. OKCoin and Huobi did not respond to requests for further information, though a customer service representative for Huobi had indicated that it had ""paused"" new lending services. At press time, traders were reporting that loan-based trading services were no longer available on Huobi. OKCoin's international and China-facing websites OKCoin.com and OKCoin.cn were said to be offering limited or augmented versions of the services, though traders were reporting different experiences. While some users told CoinDesk they were able to borrow 2x leverage at press time (even when executing CNY-denominated trades on OKCoin.cn), others indicated that their accounts were prohibiting this action. One trader said he was able to see higher margin options, but only able to borrow lower amounts. (OKCoin representatives did not respond to requests for further clarity). Nonetheless, news spread quickly about the changes on social media, with seven local industry representatives acknowledging they were aware of the supposed changes (some noted that they had yet to actively test their perceptions via exchange accounts). Still, local traders indicated that they were not surprised by the news that some margin trading services had been updated, given the longstanding lack of legal clarity under which the exchanges had operated. One former representative of a China-based exchange, who declined to be quoted on the record, indicated that he is unsure of whether the issue would have been with the service itself or the way it was marketed to consumers. ""I don't know if it's [paused] while they implement a system that's agreeable to the government, or if it's gone for good,"" he said. OTC trader Zhao Dong, likewise, hinted at how this development could come to shape the bitcoin markets, portraying it as a double-edged sword for the industry. ""The good side of margin trading is it provided additional liquidity to the market, the bad side is it is easy for investors to lose money,"" he said. Yet from some quarters of the Chinese bitcoin space, there was a broad feeling that further engagement with regulators will be forthcoming.

                            Bitcoin Took a Break From Being Volatile and Broke $800 Today                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-took-break-volatile-broke-800-today/," The price of bitcoin enjoyed a break from its recent volatility today, spending most of the day trading within reasonably tight ranges. Overall, the digital currency's price started by fluctuating mostly between $745 and $775, CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal, before tracking higher. Later, the price would edge upward, passing $800 at 16:30 UTC, and proceeding to trade between $800 and $820 until roughly 21:00 UTC. At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $804.30. Though this may seem like a bumpy day, the developments follow nearly a week of sessions in which prices roiled on the news the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) had held meetings with the country’s major exchanges last week. Prior to this, bitcoin prices had been trading at a three-year high of $1,153, however, uncertainty over the nature and outcome of the meetings (though all parties have provided public statements on their content) continues to linger. For a while this resulted in volatility, but bitcoin was arguably more stable today as market participants became interested in how any long-term trend could develop. To some observers, the decline in price fluctuations could simply be the result of traders who are sitting on the sidelines and waiting to see what will come of this government inquiry. According to Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, the market hasn't decided if it's going up or down just yet. ""The market is in a state of uncertainty and has failed to recover as of yet, despite reaching a monthly support level around $750,"" he said. Zivkovski noted that until the nation’s central bank has provided greater clarity on the matter, he believes that bitcoin prices could experience significant volatility. Other, wilder theories emerged as well. Arthur Hayes, CEO of bitcoin options exchange BitMEX, noted that the market is in a ""state of suspense"" pending updates, though he suggested the downside risk of further action was high. Hayes went so far as to speculate that the PBOC could limit margin trading, an event he suggested would limit volume and harm prices. Adding to the suspense is that the market movements resemble those observed in 2013, when PBOC actions derailed the digital currency's appreciation and sent it on a years-long downward slide. Whether or not history will be repeated is likely something on most traders' minds. Blue sky image via Shutterstock

                            Just 7 People Complained to the CFPB About Bitcoin in 2016                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/seven-complaints-cfpb-virtual-currency-2016/,"New data shows American consumers filed a total of just seven complaints with the US Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) in 2016. The CFPB was created in the wake of the financial crisis of the late 2000s as part of a bid to more closely scrutinize financial products and services in the US. The agency began accepting complaints related to digital currencies in August 2014. Now, student loan marketplace LendEDU has scraped data from the CFPB's public complaints database, finding that, of the nearly 190,000 complaints filed over the course of 2016, only seven of them related to digital currency services. Four of those were filed against Coinbase while three were submitted against Circle. According to the CFPB database, only one complaint – filed against Coinbase on 29th November – is in-progress, whereas the remaining six were closed. The amount of complaints in other categories dwarfs those in the virtual currency bracket. For example, LendEDU found that 43,841 complaints were made regarding credit reporting; 40,965 for mortgages; and 39,759 for debt collection. But why the low number, compared to the others? The data could simply be reflective of a relatively low number of consumers using bitcoin services. Conversely, consumers may not know that the CFPB – itself only a five-year-old agency – even takes complaints related to the tech, meaning that other parts of the government could be on the receiving end of complaints. Still, in its blog post, LendEDU noted that the data suggests authorities don’t have much to investigate. ""Fortunately for consumers, virtual currency doesn't seem to be a huge issue,"" the company said. ""Or at least not an issue garnering too many complaints."" The findings echo past deep-dives into the CFPB data in this area. The nonprofit advocacy group Coin Center reported in July of last year that a review of complaint data from 2011 through 2015 revealed 37 complaints filed against companies in the digital currency space, including Coinbase as well as other firms like the now-defunct GAW Miners and Butterfly Labs, among a number of others.

BTC123, established in 2011, announced today that it would halt deposits for a financial management system denominated in bitcoin and the yuan beginning on 26th January. The company is also retooling an interest-generating feature on the site, lowering rates that users can earn effective tomorrow. In the blog post, the company cited regulatory requirements in China, naming the People’s Bank of China (the country’s central bank) and the Ministry of Public Security (China’s main policy authority), when explaining the changes. Ricardo Zhang, CEO of BTC123, said that his company is retooling its strategy in light of the shifting regulatory environment. However, Zhang said the startup had not been contacted directly by the central bank. Echoing other domestic bitcoin services, Zhang said that the site would adhere to any regulations required by the Chinese government. He told CoinDesk: BTC123's shift comes after the company announced a new round of funding via the social media platform Weibo when, on 29th December, the site said it had raised 10 million yuan (roughly $1.5m at press time). In addition to offering financial management and price data from major Chinese exchanges, BTC123 also offers news and information related to bitcoin and blockchain tech. The development is the first sign that increased scrutiny by regulators in China may be having an effect on bitcoin-related services in the country. Last week, word emerged that representatives from major Chinese bitcoin exchanges had met with officials from the PBoC. Subsequent reporting revealed that regulators in China were moving to monitor exchange activities more closely (though there is debate about the impact of the move). Exchanges in China have since called for a balanced regulatory approach, while local traders have reported they are largely unconcerned by the developments. Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

China's Big Bitcoin Traders Are All-In On Bitcoin                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/what-central-bank-chinas-big-bitcoin-traders-are-still-all-in-on-bitcoin/," Despite recent reports that suggest China's central bank is casting a critical eye on domestic bitcoin exchanges, local traders remain largely unfazed. In conversations with CoinDesk, members of the country's bitcoin trading community, as well as cryptocurrency exchange operators who were not involved in the talks, expressed their belief that the increased oversight of the industry will be a boon for the technology in the long term. Over-the-counter trader Zhao Dong, who says he trades 250 BTC (or about $150,000) in the digital currency daily, said in interview that he had ""no worries"" about the future of the tech. Overall, he believes that, rather than hostile, the People's Bank of China merely wants to limit investor risk, and that it has no intention of harming or otherwise limiting use of the technology. Zhao told CoinDesk: Zhou Shouji, the operator of FinTech Blockchain Group, a bitcoin hedge fund that claims to have amassed $20m in investments, stressed that, despite the ""high volatility"" in the market, local traders ""are not worried"" about any potential government actions. ""Everyone gets the message,"" he added. The statements come as the impact of the decision by the PBoC to make public its meetings with bitcoin exchanges BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin has left the bitcoin market in flux. (Yesterday, it hit its lowest point in one month). At press time, the price of bitcoin was $770, a value that was roughly 40% below peak prices observed earlier this year. Yet, while confidence may still be high, some trading firms are reporting changes in customer behavior since the decline began. Kong Gao, an employee at OTC trading firm Richfund, for example, noted that his firm had seen rapid new customer growth in the run up to the $1,153 price peak. Since then, though, he said this steady growth has declined. The statements are notable given that OTC trading primarily appeals to larger investors, those who would otherwise influence the bitcoin price on exchanges with large purchases that can cause slippage. ""A rally like this one does have some impact on OTC volume,"" Kong said. ""Some of them have been anxious, but we have assured them this kind of volatility is not really uncommon in Bitcoinland."" Kong declined to provide figures to support how much trading had been affected. CHBTC, an exchange that sees roughly $115,000 in BTC/CNY trading daily, reported that it is still seeing new customers, even if activity is a little depressed. ""Most traders are holding back to see what happens next,"" a spokesperson for the exchange said. She added that CHBTC ""welcomes"" the regulation, echoing statements made by BTCC and OKCoin in the wake of last week's news. But even after the initial news has subsided, there remains a worry that the government's move could be followed by future enforcement actions. Zhao Dong noted that there is a perception that Chinese exchanges display ""fake volumes"", a criticism that has long been prevalent in the West, and that has contributed to a notable distrust of these firms. Zhao, however, stressed that ""not all volumes"" are fake, and that there are ""many speculators and arbitrageurs"" in China that are responsible for contributing to the country's volume. (Figures from CoinDesk Research project 95% of bitcoin trading volumes occur on China-based exchanges). Harry Yeh, managing partner at US OTC firm Binary Financial, agreed that China's market is ""huge"", or at least larger than many people in the West think. ""I think people underestimate how big bitcoin is in China. Some of the biggest traders, the biggest miners are all based out of China,"" he said. However, he acknowledged that findings of fraudulent activity would be ""bad"" for the market. Others stressed the common refrain among bitcoin's ardent supports that, even if China did move to stop or stem trading, the technology would still proliferate due to the power of the blockchain and its peer-to-peer design. A representative of China-based exchange Yunbi, for instance, noted that he is ""not worried"" about the impact, despite the fact his exchange was not in conversation with the PBoC.

                            Why I'm Fighting the IRS's Bitcoin Privacy Invasion                        ",Jeffrey Berns,https://www.coindesk.com/im-fighting-irss-bitcoin-privacy-invasion/,"Jeffrey K Berns is a bitcoin user, Coinbase customer and a managing partner at multi-specialty law firm Berns Weiss LLP. In this CoinDesk opinion piece, Berns explains why he chose to seek to intervene in the IRS's attempt to obtain from Coinbase the identities of, and information concerning, millions of US cryptocurrency users.   On 30th November, 2016, a federal court issued an order allowing the IRS to serve an unprecedented summons on Coinbase, Inc, a cryptocurrency exchange, seeking the identities of each of the company's millions of US customers and essentially every piece of information in the company's possession concerning those customers. As a consumer protection and class action attorney (as well as a cryptocurrency and blockchain entrepreneur), I am deeply concerned about the potential impact that Coinbase's disclosure of this information could have on the burgeoning industry. I am also troubled by the IRS's motives in issuing this summons. While I don't want to bore you with the legal procedure that led to the issuance of the summons, the bottom line is that courts grant the IRS substantial leeway to issue a ""John Doe"" summons to a third-party to require it to identify its customers whom the IRS suspects of tax evasion. Typically, this has occurred when the IRS identifies a practice that has no legitimate purpose, such as improper tax shelters or offshore bank accounts. In those cases, the IRS has the power to issue summonses to tax shelter promoters and financial institutions to identify likely tax evaders, as there is no other way for the IRS to obtain that information. In contrast to those circumstances, cryptocurrencies (such as bitcoin and ether) have clearly legitimate uses, such that there is no reason to suspect that an individual is engaging in tax avoidance behavior merely because they have chosen to buy or use cryptocurrency. Indeed, many major online retailers already accept bitcoin, such as Overstock.com, Dell and others. So, how did I get here? The IRS's characterization of all cryptocurrency users as potential tax evaders concerned me immediately when I first learned of the summons. As I have been involved in the cryptocurrency and blockchain community since 2012, I knew that there was no reason to suspect that any meaningful portion of Coinbase's customers were transacting in cryptocurrency to avoid tax obligations. As I investigated the matter further, I learned that not only was I correct, but that the IRS's actions were even more outrageous than I had originally thought. Incredibly, the IRS's petition to serve the summons seeking information for millions of Coinbase customers was based primarily on three instances of supposed tax evasion involving bitcoin. I was so appalled by the flimsy justification for the summons that I determined to investigate the matter further and, as a Coinbase customer, fight the IRS if and when the court granted its petition to serve the summons on Coinbase. My interests in pursuing this action are twofold. First, I am concerned about the privacy rights of all Coinbase customers, as the IRS is seeking an extraordinary amount of information. This unprecedented demand raises massive security issues concerning the cryptocurrency owned by the customers in view of the government's difficulty in protecting itself from hackers. Second, I am very worried about the effect this summons could have on the continued expansion and development of blockchain technology in the US. Google co-founder Larry Page has said, ""Lots of companies don’t succeed over time. What do they fundamentally do wrong? They usually miss the future."" To the extent that it is taking steps to actively discourage the use of cryptocurrency by US citizens, I strongly believe that the US government is jeopardizing the country’s role in the global economy going forward. Cryptocurrency, and the blockchain technology that underlie it, have virtually unlimited potential to change the way that individuals and businesses transact with each other. I believe that this will happen in a way that will greatly benefit consumers through better privacy, reduced transaction costs, enhanced security and faster processing times. In this way, my stance is about how the government should be fostering this technology, rather than fighting it. While the IRS is mounting a procedural challenge to prevent the court from considering the issues that I have raised, I pledge to do whatever is necessary to insure that the IRS must explain how it could possibly be entitled to the information that it seeks. The federal government must not be allowed to trample on the rights of individuals and to stifle innovation due to an undisclosed political agenda. Boxing fist via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin ATMs Are Being Attacked With Hammers in the US Midwest                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-atms-attacked-hammers-us-midwest/,"At least three people have been accused of smashing dozens of bitcoin ATMs in the the Midwestern US. According to court documents filed in the US District Court for the North District of Illinois and obtained by CoinDesk, Andrew Konja, Alvin Konja and Odai Mabroukare are being accused of perpetrating a ""scheme of intimidation and destruction"" aimed to force out competing ATM operators in Detroit and Chicago. Their goal, the lawsuit alleges, is to put other operators at a disadvantage through extortion and destruction of property. The plaintiff in the case – SandP Solutions, Inc, which does business as Bitcoin of America – filed suit late last month, and is being represented by attorney William P Suriano of Riverside, Illinois. The defendants are accused of violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act. Among the allegations, is that those involved in the scheme attempted to extort other bitcoin ATM operators by requesting digital currency payments in return for protection. The complaint cites one bitcoin ATM operator who paid the demanded sum. In total, the plaintiff reports that ""approximately 70 bitcoin ATMs"" have been smashed, including ""nearly 20"" operated by Bitcoin of America. The complaint explains: The defendants would then go on to offer to repair the broken ATMs owned by affected operators. Further, according to the complaint, the alleged scheme continues to this day. ""This scheme began approximately nine months ago and is on-going,"" attorneys for the plaintiff wrote. Andrew Konja, according to the complaint, had run his own ATM business ""which he sold or which was merged into Bitexpress"", a reference to a Philadelphia-based ATM operator. Bitexpress did not immediately respond to a request for comment. A full copy of the complaint can be found below: Complaint (1) by CoinDesk on Scribd

                            Lightning Strikes: An (Early) Version of Bitcoin's Big Scaling Solution is Here                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/lightning-strikes-early-version-bitcoins-big-scaling-solution-finally/," Developers can now test an early version of bitcoin's much-hyped Lightning Network. Released by one of the most prominent startups working on the open-source micropayments protocol (San Francisco-based Lightning Labs), the daemon runs on the bitcoin testnet, so it's not exactly for average users yet. Rather, the aim is for developers to get their feet wet testing the off-chain transactions, long heralded as one of the best ways to rapidly scale the network, (and it looks like some have already started). Speaking to CoinDesk today, the Lightning Labs team called the release the “most feature-complete” implementation of the Lightning Network. Taken together, they said it packages the full requirements of a working off-chain network, including the ability for channels to open and close and for payments to find a path through the network. Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark told CoinDesk: Lightning co-founder Joseph Poon, one of the authors of the concept's original white paper, added that the idea is to help prepare developers for Lightning's launch on the live bitcoin blockchain and to ease businesses into integrating it. Overall, the team seemed eager to give interested developers more guidance. ""We're hoping that moving forward they'll be able to contribute, but also test, since it's pretty much wide open now,"" developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun said. He mentioned that Thursday, Lightning Labs will also be releasing a walk-through post along with a “channel faucet"" that will release test coins developers can use to test transactions. Bitfury, Blockchain Lab, and Chaincode Labs also contributed to the release. For those who want to find out more, the features in the daemon are those described in the in-progress standards, which outline what features each of the eight or so Lightning projects need to support in order to interoperate. Right now, developers need to run a bitcoin node to try out the daemon, but a less resource-intensive, Lightning-compatible lite-client is in the works. Osuntokun mentioned that it will likely be packaged with some other tools, such as a user interface. All that said, it might not be the milestone the community is looking for right now. The version is not compatible with the existing bitcoin codebase since it relies on a multi-faceted upgrade known as SegWit, which will make the off-chain channels more secure (as well as enable other long-term benefits like more advanced scripting, as Poon emphasized). While most in the bitcoin community say the code will be a boost overall, it’s been somewhat controversial, and only about 25% of the necessary 95% of miners have flagged support for the change since November. “We built this release with the expectation that it will trigger, and I think if you look at past histories of when other soft forks have triggered, sometimes it just took a critical mass. Just because the number is stable right now doesn’t mean we can’t reach critical mass,” Stark said. She noted that the proposal doesn't expire until 15th November of this year. Yet, Poon and Osuntokun emphasized that a version of the Lightning Network, although limited and less user friendly, is possible without SegWit. Poon concluded: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Lightning Labs. Astronaut in space image via Shutterstock

                            The IRS is Catching Flack Again for Weak Bitcoin Guidance (This Time on IRAs)                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/gao-irs-report-bitcoin-guidance-individual-retirement-accounts/,"US citizens who invest retirement money in bitcoin or other digital currencies could face unforeseen tax consequences as a result of IRS policies, a government report released this week argued. Originally prepared in early December, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) published a report on Monday in which it argued that the IRS needs to do more to inform taxpayers about the potential liabilities they face when investing their individual retirement accounts (IRAs) in blockchain-based assets. As the report states, US law offers a broad degree of leeway when it comes to the types of assets that people can invest in as part of an IRAs (ranging from precious metals to real estate). That said, IRS guidance as it exists today creates the risk that taxpayers may not be entirely aware of tax liabilities (or penalties) that may arise from these investments, the GAO argued. The report's authors note: In a way, the report's recommendations – with which the GAO said the IRS ""generally agreed"" – mirror criticisms highlighted in a separate report prepared by the inspector general of the US tax agency. That report, published in November by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA), said the IRS is at risk of not catching potential tax cheats who use digital currencies to avoid reporting requirements. Tax professionals have also blasted the agency for failing to provide more in-depth guidance. The IRS has since moved to expand its oversight of digital currency transactions, seeking information on users from digital currency exchange Coinbase as part of that push. (Though it has generated criticism here, too). In total, more than 485,000 IRA accounts (worth an estimated $49.7bn) are invested in unconventional assets, the GAO said, relying on information gathered from 17 custodians. However, it is unclear how many may be invested in bitcoin or digital currencies. The full report can be found below: Gao Report by CoinDesk on Scribd  Egg smashing image via Shutterstock

Bitcoin prices hit a low of $752.11 – $0.05 beneath the low reported on 2nd December, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The figure represents a roughly 42% drop from the market high of $1,153.02 reported on 5th January. Today saw prices drop below the $800 mark for the first time since 21st December as price volatility shows no sign of abating. Markets are reporting an average price of $768.05, BPI data shows, a drop of more than 15% from the day’s $904.79 opening price. At the time of report, bitcoin was trading at $771.39.

                            Blockchain Angels Invest $1 Million in Bitcoin-Ethereum Hybrid Qtum                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-angels-invest-1-million-bitcoin-ethereum-hybrid-qtum/," A new public blockchain that would seek to merge popular design aspects of both the bitcoin and ethereum blockchains has raised $1m in funding. By marrying bitcoin's transaction model with a similar consensus system to the one in development at ethereum, Singapore-based Qtum is seeking to appeal to distributed application developers who may be experiencing difficulties with one or both systems. Investors in the company include a host of notable blockchain entrepreneurs, including ethereum founder Anthony Di Iorio, OKCoin CEO Star Xu, BitFund founder Xiaolai Li and Fenbushi partner Bo Shen. Speaking to CoinDesk, Di Iorio lauded the team's leadership as one of its main strengths. ""All in all, I believe them to be the best team out of China and Asia,"" he said. ""This has led them to see where improvements are needed in smart contract platforms, learn from mistakes of ethereum, focus on the region they know best."" As explained by Qtum's founders, the open-source technology borrows key elements from each project, and is thus more of a union of both networks, even though it would have its own blockchain and investable token. (Technically, Qtum is a fork of Bitcoin Core version 0.13, running with the ethereum virtual machine – the element that executes that platform's smart contracts). Such an idea is also being explored by the team behind the startup Rootstock, which raised $1m in March to bring smart contracts to the bitcoin blockchain. Patrick Dai, founder of the Qtum Foundation, indicated that the $1m will now help his team to prepare the infrastructure necessary to sell the tokens in a public initial coin offering (ICO), or a public sale of unique cryptographic tokens to investors. Dai told CoinDesk: Dai said that the Qtum Foundation could seek to raise up to $10m in the token offering. In Q3 of 2016, nearly $200m was raised in ICOs, according to CoinDesk Research data. Qtum also claims to be partnering with PwC Asia, which both its team members and investors said will be providing accounting services for the project. While Rootstock aims to improve the bitcoin network, a key aspect of Qtum's pitch is that existing public blockchain developers have become so dissatisfied with their current choices that they will seek a new alternative. Dai believes that bitcoin and ethereum both have design flaws that would inhibit certain uses, which would enable room for Qtum to become a notable alternative. For instance, Dai posited that enterprise developers may be dissuaded from launching a private bitcoin network due to its use of proof-of-work for its consensus model. ""The consensus part is not scalable. You cannot deploy permissioned blockchain and maintain the network,"" Dai said. Additionally, the early interest in such an idea from the Hyperledger team is further evidence that the new blockchain should be further explored, he suggested. Notably, the design would incorporate support for so-called ""blockchain oracles"" – smart contracts that would serve to facilitate interaction between the blockchain and exterior data feeds. On Qtum, these contracts would be called ""master contracts"", a feature that Dai believes will be attractive to enterprise firms like Microsoft that are exploring similar concepts. Microsoft's Project Bletchley, for instance, envisions how corporates may be able to monetize a form of oracle it calls a ""cryptlet"" as a way to boost revenue from data streams. Of course, the proof will be in how Qtum is ultimately able to attract developer interest – a tall task, Dai admitted. He concluded: Dog in dress clothes via Shutterstock

Discussed at new meetings, according to releases by its Beijing and Shanghai offices, were topics including compliance (anti-money laundering and foreign exchange management). ""The checks focused on whether the firm was operating out of its business scope, whether it was launching unauthorized financing, payment, forex business or other related businesses, whether it was involved in market manipulation, anti-money laundering or (carried) fund security risks,"" a translation provided by Reuters states. BTCC CEO Bobby Lee confirmed the meeting to CoinDesk, stating that the PBoC requested data on its operations as well as recommendations on how the government might move to regulate bitcoin exchange operations. However, Lee stressed that the on-site visitations are ""very common"" for businesses in China and continued to express an optimism about the engagement, which he framed as a long-delayed request from local businesses. ""We're now working closely with the government about what makes a healthy market,"" he said, adding: Yet, the exchange also moved formally to stem the reaction to the news. BTCC sought to discourage the speculation that has sometimes followed the PBoC's engagement with bitcoin businesses. ""We urge our customers to take a rational and cautious view to news articles which speculate on the visit and discussions,"" the exchange said. Elsewhere, it seems the meetings continue to be limited to bitcoin exchange businesses, as companies using the protocol (Circle China) and over-the-counter trading facilities (Richfund) indicated they have not engaged with the PBoC.

                            Bitcoin Investing: Where Wall Street and Silicon Valley Meet                        ",Chris Burniske & Adam White,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-where-wall-street-and-silicon-valley-meet/,"Chris Burniske is blockchain products lead at ARK Invest, an investment manager focused on disruptive innovation. Adam White is vice president and general manager at Coinbase, where he oversees its exchange service GDAX.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Burniske and White discuss their recently published white paper, ""Bitcoin, a New Asset Class"", unpacking what they see as the tech's investment potential.    While much of the traditional financial world was focused on ""blockchain"" in 2016, few gave bitcoin as much attention. When brought up, bitcoin was referenced in the context of macroeconomic dislocations like the depreciation of the Chinese yuan, India's banknote ban, or Trump's surprise election win. While these events often provided great examples of its use as a ""disaster hedge"" in the face of capital market turmoil, we believe the bigger story of bitcoin's evolution as a unique asset class was left mostly untouched. Recently, however, we have witnessed institutional investors awaking to bitcoin's maturation and long-term value proposition in the context of Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT). MPT emphasizes that investors should not consider single investments in isolation, but rather in the context of an overall portfolio. Using MPT, investors can intelligently construct portfolios by including uncorrelated assets to maximize returns for a given level of risk. Alternative assets such as gold and oil have become a popular means to add diversification to traditional portfolios of equities and bonds. In our paper, we show that bitcoin's attributes could make it a valuable addition as part of a diversified investment portfolio. Using six years of data, we investigated aspects of bitcoin's market behavior, such as its use cases, volatility, risk-reward profile and price independence. The results show bitcoin is gaining traction as a disruptive peer-to-peer currency, a development that bodes well for its long-term potential. As one of the three core pillars of a currency, we think bitcoin's use as a means of exchange is critical for its long term viability. Coinbase has unique insight into how bitcoin is being used as a means of exchange for goods and services, with around 45,000 merchants using its payment processing tools. In 2016, both the number of transactions and monthly processing volume that merchants accepted using bitcoin, doubled from the previous year. Some of this volume is being driven by new bitcoin users. For example, the number of Coinbase daily new user signups has also doubled since January 2016. In the broader bitcoin ecosystem, transactional volumes grew 118% year-over-year, with bitcoin's blockchain now processing over $115,000 per minute. As bitcoin continues to grow, Coinbase and ARK are seeing increased interest and enthusiasm from capital market investors. We believe many institutional investors are realizing bitcoin may be one of the best ways to get ""blockchain"" exposure in their portfolios. Bitcoin’s absolute returns have outpaced most other assets over the last five years, but few realize that its volatility has been dropping too. When measured by the trailing year standard deviation of daily percent price changes, bitcoin's volatility dropped 28% in 2016. Many people mistakenly equate a rising price with increased volatility. Bitcoin’s 2016 market behavior, however, provided a great counterexample to that misconception. While bitcoin’s price more than doubled last year, it did so in a gradual manner when compared with the more severe spikes and drops of years past. An instance of controlled volatility was during the August 2016 compromise of the popular bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, when bitcoin's price dropped sharply only to quickly regain its footing. We believe this to be a sign of mature investors taking up slack from weak holders, quickly balancing out the order books of bitcoin markets. In prior years, bitcoin’s recovery may not have been so graceful. To give some context on how much bitcoin’s volatility has decreased, it was 30% less volatile than Twitter’s stock in 2016, and just as volatile as USO, one of the more popular oil ETFs on the market. Dividing absolute returns (minus the risk-free rate) by standard deviation yields an investment calculation called the Sharpe Ratio, which calibrates each unit of return for the risk taken. Despite its perception as a ""high risk"" asset, in 2016 bitcoin compensated investors twice as much for the risk they took than the S&P 500 did. Moreover, 2016 provided bitcoin’s best year of risk-adjusted returns ever, as shown in the graph below from our white paper.  Over the years, bitcoin has behaved in a relatively independent manner from the broader capital markets. We believe price independence is a valuable characteristic in a world where the cadence of macroeconomic dislocations seems to be accelerating. As we saw in 2008, world markets tend to be highly correlated in times of crisis. Bitcoin, however, has shaken that trend and consistently demonstrated low correlation with other capital market assets, shown below.  Bitcoin demonstrated its differentiation as an emerging asset class within the capital markets in 2016. That said, if more institutional investors begin to incorporate bitcoin into their portfolios, bitcoin may intensify in its correlation with other capital market assets. For example, when investigating bitcoin's correlation with gold, it was interesting to us that in 2016 its correlation reversed, climbing back into positive territory. Certainly, correlation does not imply causation, but the narrative of bitcoin as gold 2.0 appears to be gaining steam in the capital markets. If bitcoin shows increased correlation with other capital market assets in 2017, then 2016 may mark the beginning of convergence between the Street, the Valley, and Satoshi’s currency.

                            BitX Rebrands as Luno, Reveals Bitcoin Sandbox Project                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitx-rebrands-luno-reveals-bitcoin-sandbox-project/," Bitcoin startup BitX has officially rebranded as Luno, a transition that finds the firm shifting focus to the European market. For the startup, which was founded in 2013, CEO Marc Swanepoel said the new name isn't about shifting away from bitcoin. Rather, he says it's about creating a brand that's both easily digestible and that doesn't bring to mind the connotation that the firm is only an exchange service. ""I think some companies rebranded because they wanted to move into blockchain,"" he said. ""We are totally the opposite: our website and products, we're very focused on bitcoin."" Swanepoel told CoinDesk: The shift follows a number of smaller moves that could help the company continue to support its mission. Luno also revealed today that it has been accepted into a government sandbox supervised by the UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Swanepoel said the move is intended to serve as a ""stepping stone"" that will enable it to extend its bitcoin wallet, exchange and enterprise services into European markets. Luno is now testing how its services can be used to transfer value between GBP and bitcoin within the sandbox, according to the CEO. Swanepoel added that the service is also set to expand through a partnership with bitcoin processing startup Simplex, which will help Luno launch services in Canada and Europe soon. The announcement comes at a time when many bitcoin startups are rebranding amid increased enterprise interest in the technology. For example, bitcoin exchange itBit has rebranded as Paxos and Latin American wallet service BitPagos changed its name to Ripio. To date, Luno has raised more than $4m in funding.

For months, some of Assange's ardent Internet fans have been theorizing that he had died. However, Assange responded in a livestreamed talk, calling the theories ""silly"" and confirming that the video wasn't prerecorded by reading off the most recent block hash (a string of letters and numbers, unique to block 447506 on the bitcoin blockchain). Assange said in the talk: The idea is that as a bitcoin block hash is hard to produce, taking a global network of powerful computers to calculate it in an average interval of 10 minutes, it would be almost impossible to guess the string of letters and numbers. However, that wasn't to say that some doubters didn't emerge. The first time reading off the hash he made a small mistake. (Users in the Twitch.tv chat room sidebar then reacted with messages like ""DEAD"" and ""DEAD LUL""). For Assange, the move isn't exactly surprising though. The statements come as the latest in what has been his long-standing support for the digital currency. Wikileaks was the first prominent organization to back the technology, using it as far back as 2012 to route value in the face of a blockade against its financial resources. Image via Reddit

                            Report: Bitcoin ETF Could Amass $300 Million in Assets (If Approved)                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/needham-bitcoin-etf-attract-300-million-assets-approved/,"A new investor note published today by analyst Needham & Company projects that a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) could attract as much as $300m in new assets in its first week alone. Writing about the potential impact of an ETF on the nascent market, analyst Spencer Bogart speculates that such an approval is likely to have a ""profoundly positive"" effect on the price of bitcoin, and that the $300m estimate is ""conservative"". ""The resulting effort to source the underlying bitcoin for the trust would likely drive the price of bitcoin up significantly,"" Bogart writes. In the scenario, he told CoinDesk that $300m in assets would mean that the ETF's authorized participants would need to source this volume of bitcoin for the ETF, sending prices higher. (Bitcoin's market cap was just over $14.5bn at press time). The catch, however, is that Bogart doesn't believe one of the major bitcoin ETF filings – the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF, proposed by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss – is likely to be approved. Though the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is expected to make a final decision on the filing by 11th March, Bogart speculates that the ETF's ""probability of approval is very low"". The note reads: Ultimately, Bogart projects that the Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF has a less than 25% chance of being approved due to a ""confluence of fear, uncertainty and doubt coupled with basic incentives at the SEC"". Bogart goes on to label any approval a ""low probability"" event with ""very significant upside"". Yet, the document also highlights a suspected peculiarity in the law that could enable the ETF to be approved – without any action from the SEC. Highlighted in the note is language that Needham says indicates could result in a scenario in which the SEC doesn't disprove the filing, and as a result, it is automatically approved. The note suggests Needham isn't sure if it's interpreting its findings correctly, but that the possibility could add an interesting dynamic to the March decision. ""We think this is interesting only because, politically, it might be easier for the individuals responsible for making the decision to let the decision go to auto-approval—which essentially only means they lack of a reason to disapprove—than it is to stick a stamp of approval on the rule change,"" it reads. In statements, however, Bogart added that he believes this possibility to be ""highly unlikely"".

""This was simply an idea suggested for discussion and to continue dialogue on enhancing consumer protection and fostering healthy, long-term growth of the industry,"" he said. Echoing statements made by BTCC CEO Bobby Lee, Xu also expressed his hope that the dialogue, and the increased public awareness of it, could improve the regulatory environment for bitcoin and digital currencies.

                            Bitcoin's Price Volatile at $900 as China Concerns Linger                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-volatile-900-china-concerns-linger/," Bitcoin prices experienced intense price volatility on 9th January, continuing a trend that's been the new normal since late last week. Prices fell nearly 5% in less than two hours across global exchange today, declining from an opening price of $913 to a daily low of $878, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data. After falling, bitcoin prices rose roughly 3.4% to $908.37, before tapering off again below $900. The continued market volatility comes in the wake of new concerns that the Chinese government may impose further restrictions on the digital currency. Recently, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) met with representatives of Chinese exchanges OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC, though the details of what was discussed in the meetings, as well as the history between the two camps, remains largely veiled. What we do know is that the PBOC released two separate statements to the public on 6th January, which both quoted a 2013 government document warning that bitcoin is not a currency and that interested investors should be sure to weigh all relevant risks. Separate reports have stated that the PBOC may have imposed (or otherwise reinforced) their desire that the exchanges limit marketing and enforce know-your-customer and anti-money laundering rules. These moves have provoked memories of 2013, when bitcoin's sharp price gains prompted China to tighten restrictions on the digital currency. Causing confusion is now what appears to be a divide between what is being reported by local Chinese news sources and the exchanges themselves. China Securities Journal, for instance, reported today that domestic regulators were considering a ""third-party hosting platform"" to protect investors, according to a prominent local Twitter news feed. Representatives from major bitcoin exchanges, however, continue to indicate that the meetings were ordinary, with one exchange employee calling the articles ""conjecture"". In comments to CoinDesk, Star Xu, CEO and founder of bitcoin exchange OKCoin, confirmed that he was present at the 6th January meeting, but stated that the exchange would not be making changes to its operations based on the conversations. Xu told CoinDesk: Elsewhere, both OKCoin and BTCC distanced themselves from reports that suggested they were under additional scrutiny due to the potential of capital flight. As for how the the developments will impact markets ahead, market participants seemed uncertain. Angel investor Chandler Guo, for instance, said that he believes this is ""just a start"" to what could be other activities from the Chinese government to crack down on bitcoin trading, though he did not add any perspective on his opinion. ""Winter is coming,"" he said, without elaborating further. Other traders, include Bitcoin Core developer BTC Drak spoke to their general distrust of the Chinese government, noting that the actions seem to have occurred during a particularly positive period for the digital currency and its outlook. ""The timing was no accident. The price was going crazy, over $1000 [and it was] covered on Chinese state TV,"" he said. The comments, while unsubstantiated, speak to the general perception in the market regarding developments in China and the practices of China-based exchanges, which have previously come under fire for volume reporting practices. Amid this environment, it's unclear what might happen next. Bitcoin prices alternate between periods where they are either rangebound or experiencing wild volatility, cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk. ""We're still in the wildly volatile mode, where minor news can trigger large moves. Sometime soon it will stabilize a bit and we should see the wall of bids and offers building up on both sides, helping stabilize the price.” Cryptocurrency hedge fund director Tim Enneking also emphasized the key role of market dynamics, noting the sharp price gains enjoyed over the last several sessions. He asserted that bitcoin's prior resistance levels became support because of these rallies. Pete Rizzo contributed reporting. China map via Shutterstock

                            Indonesia's AML Watchdog Links Bitcoin to Islamic State                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/indonesias-aml-agency-links-bitcoin-islamic-state-terrorism/,"Indonesian authorities say they have evidence that Islamic State (IS) militants are using online money services such as PayPal and bitcoin to send money to domestic operatives. Officials with Pusat Pelaporan dan Analisis Transaksi Keuangan (PPATK), an independent agency established in 2002 that enforces the country's anti-money laundering (AML) laws, gave the remarks at a public hearing today centered on the agency's performance in 2016. There, Ivan Yustiavandana, director for examination and research at PPATK, said he believes the use of bitcoin is linked to the preference these groups have shown for technologically sophisticated payment methods. As quoted by Singapore-based newspaper, The Straits Times, he said: PPATK chairman Kiagus Ahmad Badaruddin added that the agency believes terrorists are using the tools because it makes it ""harder"" for authorities to track the transaction. Notably, the agency also reported that IS operative Bahrun Naim had been using these means of sending money to IS colleagues. Naim is the man the authorities believe is behind recent attacks in Jakarta in which two civilians were killed and 24 were wounded, according to figures from CNN. At press time, the statements have also been given additional attention via reporting by The Wall Street Journal. While no data was provided by the agency, the statements are likely to continue the narrative that bitcoin and other blockchain-based digital currencies are becoming an attractive tool for terrorist funding. Following the November 2015 Paris attacks, for example, the European Union sought to take measures that would enhance the supervision of exchange startups that enable bitcoin to be traded for government-issued money. However, there is evidence that such claims may be overblown. The US Treasury Department noted in a risk assessment in 2015 that while the technology may be vulnerable to abuse, it remains unclear how widespread this illicit use of bitcoin has become. Adding to the perceived prominence of the digital currency, is that bitcoin has emerged as a way for the media to bring added attention to government actions against a broad selection of payment tools given its strong online community and following.

                            Bitcoin is Still Volatile, But That Doesn't Mean It's Not Viable                        ",Noelle Acheson,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-still-volatile-doesnt-mean-not-viable/,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and is a member of CoinDesk's product team. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  After teasing us for most late 2016, bitcoin *almost* reached a new all-time high in the first week of 2017. That is, before startling everyone with a sharp crash, rally and correction. The headlines were gripping, and transmitted that edge-of-your-seat feeling that something big was going on. But was there? I don't want to imply that price movements aren't important. A steady increase sends a message, as does a sharp plunge. But the messages sent mask the real news – bitcoin is becoming a valid alternative to fiat currencies, not because of its price, but because of its relative lack of volatility. Yes, I do mean ""lack of"". A 20% slump in one day is severe, certainly, and has no doubt caused short-term traders considerable stress. But, in the big picture, it's not material. We need to remember that, after the initial slump, bitcoin’s price ended up roughly where it was at the beginning of the week. No one can deny that bitcoin has performed well. Whether the performance is due to fundamentals such as geopolitical uncertainty or monetary turbulence (neither of which are going away any time soon), or to market dynamics (which fluctuate, as always), the outlook of bitcoin is still the same as it was a week ago. Sure, China accounts for most of bitcoin’s trading volume, and so has a strong influence on price movements, but the fundamentals are still there. Sentiment is still bullish. Experts polled by CoinDesk at the end of last year predicted end-of-2017 prices of between $1,400 and $3,000. While the eventual performance is not that relevant for bitcoin fundamentals, it does signal enough robust support to withstand short-term fluctuations. Much more important than the price is bitcoin’s volatility. Over the past few months it has fallen to levels generally considered ""acceptable"" for fiat currencies. This week's performance will no doubt push bitcoin's volatility index up a notch, but it's still less than half of what it was six months ago. Over the past three months, bitcoin's volatility (30-day vs the US$) has on occasion been lower than the South African rand, the Brazilian real and even gold. It has been close to that of the yen, the British pound and the euro. And here’s the kicker: it has achieved this without central bank intervention. This is what we should be focusing on: bitcoin’s volatility, in spite of this week's movements, is approaching that of supposedly stable fiat currencies. And it’s doing so on its own. No fiat currency can say that. And so, whatever the price movements, bitcoin is successfully showing the world that its value as an independent alternative is strong. As any economist will tell you, one of the basic requirements of ""good money"" is that its value be relatively stable. Low volatility does not produce dramatic headlines, but it is a much more important metric for investors, entrepreneurs and developers. And as new entrants join the market, volumes will continue to increase, sources will diversify, and bitcoin’s volatility will continue its downward trend.

                            Bitcoin in 2016: The Year Politics Challenged Apolitical Money                        ",Eric Lombrozo,https://www.coindesk.com/2016-bitcoin-year-politics-apolitical-money/,"Eric Lombrozo is a Bitcoin Core developer and CEO of Ciphrex, a software company developing tools and application development platforms for cryptographic transaction processing. In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Lombrozo recaps a fraught year in bitcoin's development history, one that he believes should serve as a reminder of how the community should come together and recognize its common goals.   When I first started working to develop bitcoin applications in 2011, I assumed it was a fairly stable protocol that would be unlikely to change in drastic ways – the rules were well-defined and the network was open to participation by anyone who adhered to these rules. Despite noting plenty of ways the system's design could have been made better in hindsight, it was clear that getting everyone on the network to adopt changes to these rules would be a difficult task. It was feasible to have multiple implementations as long as they all followed the same rules. But even relatively small differences in behavior could introduce systemic incompatibilities that would break the network. In general, it would be much easier to just try creating a new network from scratch, and in fact, a number of people did just that. I was involved in the early phases of two of such projects, Ripple and ethereum. Extending or modifying decentralized consensus protocols turns out to be an extremely challenging problem. As opposed to more conventional deployment models in the software industry, providing a migration path for users involves not just requiring backward compatibility with older protocols and data formats – it also requires ensuring that the economic incentive structures that provide the security as well as the eventual consistency of the entire network remain intact. In particular, when dealing with a distributed financial ledger, it is important that everyone come to agree on its state, and that nobody be able to game it unfairly or violate existing contracts at any stage of an update. I think it's fair to say that the subtle challenges posed by these requirements tend to be often highly underestimated. Bitcoin encountered its first major protocol upgrade challenge in 2015. Prior to this, the bitcoin software had been undergoing frequent updates and releases. There had even been a few additions to the protocol itself. But up until 2015, none of these updates had deliberately involved any changes that could potentially severely disrupt incentives or fork the ledger. There had been minor incidents such as the March 2013 fork that resulted from an undocumented behavior in the database engine. (This caused some nodes to reject a particular block that others had accepted). But while this particular incident required manual intervention to resolve, the incentives were still sufficiently well-aligned to allow for a coordinated cooperative effort that restored the network's functionality quickly and without significant widespread losses. 2015 marked an important turning point. It was the first time a change was proposed that predictably would alter incentives and would be certain to break compatibility in ways that would not only require extensive logistical coordination but would also lead to controversies that would make the kind of cooperation required for smooth transition extremely difficult. To the untrained eye, it seemed to be like a very innocuous and simple change, one involving a single parameter that capped transaction blocks at a maximum size of 1 MB. However, from the perspective of system engineers, what was being proposed was not just a technical change, it was a political powder keg. In a more conventional network setting, especially one where a small number of players could control the execution environment (such as is the case with deployment of new servers within an organization), such a parameter change would seem like an almost trivial change. Engineers would have to weigh the tradeoffs in terms of system behavior and costs. Processing bigger blocks would require bigger, more powerful hardware, but the extra costs can be calculated and the organization can decide whether the greater transaction throughput justifies these costs. However, in a decentralized deployment setting, especially one where participation is voluntary, the entire network is held together by economic incentives in a tight balance, and all network participants must agree to the same rules governing how a financial ledger can be modified. In this way, even such a seemingly trivial change can become a monumental task fraught with tremendous risks. I had already been working on Bitcoin Core for a few years by this time, and I was already very familiar with many of the difficulties that arise in free, open-source software development. But for the first time, I felt the entire bitcoin network (with a market capitalization in the billions of US dollars) was potentially threatened by rising community tensions. I, myself, had no particularly strong preferences for a given maximum block size. But I would have liked to see a good long-term solution emerge where block size could increase dynamically as better technology emerges. This seems to be a common view among many bitcoin developers, but a good solution continues to elude us and will require more work. What was clear was that attempts to just alter this parameter or remove it were highly controversial, and that the economic incentives keeping the network healthy were at risk. The fact that it was controversial meant that without overwhelming stakeholder support that could keep the differing incentives in balance, coordinating a smooth transition would be nearly impossible – there was a very real risk of the network splitting in two or more fragments, all of which would be incompatible with one another. I should point out that no one is to be faulted for this – it is the nature of a system that is designed to be immutable. And had it not been this particular issue, some other controversial issue would have arisen sooner or later. The problems mentioned above had been discussed to considerable length in public discussions, which continued throughout 2015 and well into 2016. Perhaps what was most surreal was seeing the community splinter and fragment as inaccurate information flooded outwards. Camps formed, largely based on events occurring on social forums and a few stories pushed by mainstream media that many engineers viewed as tangential to the essence of the problem. Perhaps ironically, the response to these ended up resembling quite closely the kinds of scenarios that some had anticipated might result from controversial protocol change proposals. It became clear then that despite the issue having arisen due to a technical challenge – namely, how to scale transaction throughput while keeping fees low and the network decentralized – the biggest challenge bitcoin was facing at this time was not technical but political and social. A campaign attempting to circumvent the technical review process had been unleashed, and the existing technical review process at the time was ill-equipped to handle this kind of scenario. With this, 2016 was the year that the term ""hard fork"" entered the popular lexicon – it was the year the world would see the first highly publicized occurrence of a contentious hard fork on a consensus network with significant capitalization. This occurred, of course, on the ethereum network after a major project – The DAO – was hacked, which caused the ethereum network to split into two different networks. For those who are new to the term, a hard fork is any change to consensus rules in a decentralized consensus network that would cause nodes that adopt the changes to fork off to a separate network from nodes that do not adopt the changes. If the changes in question are universally supported by all network participants, then the problem of deployment reduces to one of logistics. These sorts of logistical issues are still quite intricate and carry risks – but they can be tackled via technical means – and it is within the scope of engineering to find workable solutions. However, if the changes are controversial, the problem ceases to be within the realm of engineering and becomes political. Emphatically, bitcoin and proof-of-work blockchains generally do not offer solutions to the basic political problems that have plagued humanity since prehistoric times. Thousands of years of history have demonstrated that the resolution of political disputes is a very hard problem fraught with social unrest, and at times resulting in war and bloodshed. What bitcoin offers is a form of money that is defined by algorithmic rules, enforced not by some external party but by the natural economic and social incentives of the participants within the system, in a decentralized manner. Participation in networks like bitcoin is voluntary. In the event of an incompatible ledger change that is controversial, unless the different parties are able to arrive at some resolution, either one party must coerce the others into adhering; or the parties must all go their separate ways. Coercing people to change their software takes us outside the realm of computer code. Even if a reasonably fair democratic process existed and were to be used (and that's a huge if), it significantly degrades the voluntary nature of participation. And if the parties go their separate ways, the network fragments, reducing its utility and destroying people’s confidence in the underlying financial assets. For bitcoin to have value, we need a robust, global network that can withstand determined, well-funded attacks. It must retain its security and stability even in times of turmoil. As we begin 2017, I encourage people to look to ways we can continue to build upon this technology while avoiding divisive scenarios that could threaten to destabilize or fragment the network.

                            The Only 10 Bitcoin Stock Photos You'll Ever See                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/the-only-10-bitcoin-stock-photos-youll-ever-see/,"Bitcoin: you can't see it, you can't touch it, but you've still got to find some way to illustrate an article about it day after day, week after week. It's actually a trade secret in the bitcoin industry that there are only 10 types of bitcoin stock images in existence, with the illusion of variety being created by making slight variations of these template pictures and hoping desperately that none of the readers will notice. In this feature, CoinDesk explains the secret meaning behind the only bitcoin images you'll ever see. Be warned, the world may never look the same again. You know the great thing about 'mining' as a metaphor? There’s a ton of pictures of it. But since modern mines actually look like the set of a Lord of the Rings movie, it’s better to picture the golden age of mining, where a hobo with a strong back and a dream could hitch his way out to the Klondike and come back richer than your grandma’s beef stew. What’s the hashrate of that pickaxe, pardner? Look at this guy: he's got bitcoin on the brain, literally. He can’t think of anything else. ""Dedicated"", you might think, ""good for him"". What you don't know is that he’s slowly starving to death in his apartment because he hasn’t stopped watching the price ticker for 72 hours straight, his girlfriend left because he spent more time on r/btc than he did with her, and now he won’t even answer calls from his mom. Poor dude. The year is 2025, the place, somewhere finance-y, probably Asia because they're already a little bit in the future. Dramatically lit skyscrapers loom in the background, adorned with some form of the bitcoin logo and a liberal use of the Photoshop glow filter. Disembodied symbols float through the air: stock charts, chat bubbles, perhaps a Wi-Fi sign or two: it's like William Gibson writing a dramatized version of Roger Ver's twitter feed. 'The Skyline' tells you that the future of money is here and it's going to blow your tiny mind. Put the bitcoin on ya phone, bada-bing bada-boom, three words for ya baby: magic mobile money. Fuhgeddaboutit. You know what people in the bitcoin community never talk about? The fact that cryptocurrency is better than fiat. So just to be absolutely clear, here’s a picture of a bitcoin beating fiat currency in some way: displacing the dollar, outperforming the pound, roundhousing the rupee, fencing the franc, knifing the naira, boxing the baht, wristlocking the riyal, and powerbombing the peso off the top rope into a steel chair. You get the idea. ""Let me tell you why you’re here. You’re here because you felt something. You’ve felt it your entire life: There’s something wrong with the world. You don’t know what it is, but it’s there. Like a splinter in your mind. Driving you mad. It is this feeling that has brought you to me. Do you know what I’m talking about?"" ""The Blockchain."" ""Do you want to know what it is...?"" Time was, if you wanted to make a collage you had to go to the trouble of finding some magazines, cutting out pictures, gluing them together ... but no more! These days you can stitch together a heavy handed visual metaphor faster than you can say ‘successful businessman’. So here’s a tip: combine any object with a picture of some circuitry and you’re showing that it’s like that thing – but more tech. A globe and some wires? The Internet! Money and a motherboard? Bitcoin! You can try it out at home, but be careful, kids. INT Boardroom, day. [Executive 1]: Tompkins, bitcoins don't have a physical form. There's no way we can photograph them. It's impossible.

Sure, storing bitcoins safely these days means putting them in a triple factor cold storage nuclear bunker in space, but isn’t that basically the same as locking it with a big lock? I thought so. This picture represents the kind of safety and security that we had in the good old days when the world was still made up of physical things that you could touch. ""Remember physical things?"" you’ll say one day over a pint of cybeer in your favourite VR bar. ""Things were great weren’t they? Back when they were actually made of stuff.

                            China to Restrict Bitcoin Marketing, But Blockchain Firms Unaffected                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/chinas-central-bank-restrict-bitcoin-marketing-blockchain/," Just hours after it was first revealed that the People's Bank of China (PBoC) had held closed-door meetings with domestic bitcoin exchanges, new details are emerging about the conversations. According to a new report by Caixin, the PBoC sought to restrict how the exchanges could seek to acquire potential new users, with the central bank indicating that the startups aren't able to mention the depreciation of the yuan in connection with marketing or otherwise promote their services offline. Some of the involved exchanges were said to have cancelled planned activities that would have potentially utilized such a strategy. The article further states that exchanges were advised to comply with know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) laws, and to refrain from using automated trading bots to boost volume, according to translation provided by Eric Zhao, from the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A regional exchange employee wishing to remain anonymous dismissed the news as ""no big deal"" and unlikely to be motivated by any fears that bitcoin may compete with the yuan. Another exchange employee, who wished to remain unidentified, expressed dissatisfaction with the reporting, alleging that some of the directives were not in fact new, though he did not provide clarity on which might have been previously given. Past precedent provides some hints, though, as bitcoin companies in the region, in one instance, have previously backed out of public conferences due to regulatory pressure. The comments notably follow news that China's State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is looking into bitcoin under its mandate for stopping capital flight. At press time, representatives from BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin had yet to respond to requests for comment. Notably, such instructions do not appear to have been given to startups working on blockchain projects or implementations using the distributed ledger technology behind bitcoin or alternative cryptographic tokens. DJ Qian, CEO of blockchain-as-a-service startup BitSE, for example, indicated that the news ""does not affect its business"" due to its focus on non-monetary applications, a statement that was echoed in other responses. Tong Li, CEO of Circle China, the bitcoin and blockchain-based messaging service, noted that he is not concerned about the directives or its impact on Circle's operations. However, he did suggest that the announcement would be worth ""following closely"". Blockchain investor Bo Shen, founding partner of Fenbushi Capital, expressed similar sentiment, indicating that he had not been in contact with any central bank officials about the topics discussed with bitcoin exchanges. Shen is one of the more prolific investors in China-based blockchain projects, backing firms including Juzhen Financials as well as a number of open-source, alternative blockchain projects. Adding potential insight is that Shen did offer a few words of advice to local exchanges, adding: Chinese-style architecture via Shutterstock

                            2013 to 2017: Comparing Bitcoin's Biggest Price Rallies                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/2013-today-comparing-bitcoins-biggest-rallies/," Is it 2013 or 2017? For bitcoin's investors, traders and enthusiasts, an answer to this question might be harder to give today than you might imagine. Bitcoin prices surged above the $1,100 mark this week (near all-time highs) only to sink back down to earth amid higher volatility and foreboding – if not unclear – news out of China. Taken together, the developments evoke memories of 2013, when the price of bitcoin surged to similar levels, bringing the digital currency to international attention. Both rallies were buoyed by bullish sentiment among those actually trading in the market, and somewhat more eerily, both would face headwinds from events in China. At the same time, the ecosystem is fundamentally different today than it was in 2013-2014, both in terms of the exchange ecosystem (where the majority of trades are happening) and the amount of public interest in the digital currency itself (and its underlying blockchain technology). So, how do the two bull-runs stack up side-by-side? We explore some similarities and differences below using data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index and data provider Bitcoinity, as well as comments from industry participants. First, let’s start with the price. The graph below shows the price as it progressed from 6th September to 6th January in 2013, a four-month period during which the price shot past the $1,100 mark to its highest price ever.  Now, let’s take a look at the past three months.  Seems a bit different, right? Or maybe not? Now that we’ve laid the scenes for the respective rallies, let’s compare the two. The most glaring difference developing between the two rallies lies in how quickly they came together. Prices climbed quickly during the 2013 rally, soaring more than $600 in a two-week period. By contrast, the recent rally developed more slowly over time. This state of affairs changed over time, particularly as December drew to a close, and prices inched closer to $1,000. The data suggests that the 2013 rally was far more volatile in its buildup, whereas in the aftermath of the peak, there are more similarities in terms of volatility. In total, the price of bitcoin was above $1,000 for just 10 days in 2013, and only one day in 2014, according to BPI data. In 2013, prices quickly returned to the $600-$700 level, a low that, at press time, hadn't yet been reached in 2017. On the other hand, both have similarities. Both rallies were buoyed by bullish sentiment among stake-holders, with those trading or watching the markets expressing a strong belief that markets would keep on rising – ""to the moon"", so to speak. Price data, however instructive, is only part of the picture, though. To look at another side – and gain a window into some of the ecosystem differences between now and then – one should take a closer peek at volume data between the respective rallies. For that, we'll turn to data provider Bitcoinity, which publishes information on global bitcoin trading markets. Let’s cast a wide net and look at the volume picture over a five-year period, predating the 2013 run.  Some obvious differences emerge. For starters, trading in 2013 was largely contained to the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox – in its heyday, as much as 90% of the world’s non-OTC bitcoin trading traffic passed through the market. This stands in sharp contrast to today’s picture, in which bitcoin has several China-based exchanges that play host to a majority of trading, with other markets, like Bitstamp, Bitfinex and Coinbase serving sizeable portions of the market as well. What’s more, trading volumes – denominated in BTC – was much lower back then, the data suggests. A key difference emerges: traders are simply exchanging more bitcoins, which could be a result of an increase in algorithmic trading, a rise in the number of traders or other factors that aren’t immediately apparent when looking at the data. Bitcoinity’s data on the amount of trades-per-minute bears out this theory to some extent. It's in this volume picture that the differences between the two rallies can be seen more clearly. Trading has taken place across a broader number of exchanges in a more developed exchange ecosystem. Further, during the first rally, trading was largely contained to what has since been established as a fraudulent exchange that was at the time insolvent. Bram Ceelen, co-founder of cryptocurrency brokerage Anycoin Direct, told CoinDesk that he believes this is an important difference, noting how he believes what was a market bolstered by manipulation in 2013 is now more mature. ""Bitcoin is on the radar of a lot more wealthy investors and other people as in 2013. At that time it was complete madness and greed (plus maybe the effects of Willy bot) that drove up the price,” he told CoinDesk. Mt Gox CEO Mark Karpeles would later be arrested under suspicion of fraud and embezzlement. Another notable development is the rise of leveraged trading. In 2013, most major exchanges only offered buying and selling options (and was the case with Mt Gox), sometimes even this simple service wasn't always reliable or dependable. Now, however, a number of major bitcoin exchanges allow traders to take out 5x, 10x or even 20x leverage on bitcoin traders. These large positions now make the market volatile as traders can consolidate large positions around certain price points. Such was the case earlier this week when sell orders in the $900-range were liquidated, causing the price to drop precipitously in just an hour. Yet, despite the huge losses suffered here, Petar Zivkovski, COO of Whaleclub, argued that there were more fundamental underpinnings behind the most recent rally – and decline. ""In 2013, the rise was powered by speculation and the ensuing selloff was the result of early adopters cashing in around the $1,000 psychological level,” Zivkovski explained. “It was both an unhealthy rise and selloff."" He told CoinDesk: Others pointed to less tangible details. Marco Streng, CEO of hosted mining firm Genesis Mining, posited that it was the 2013 rally itself that set the stage for the recent price run – and that growth in the broader bitcoin and blockchain industry was part and parcel to that development. Since that time, more than $1bn has been invested in bitcoin companies, with many providing services that enable its blockchain to be more useful as a payment network, remittance channel or vehicle for speculation.

                            Report: Chinese Regulators Exploring Bitcoin Connection to Capital Flight                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/report-chinese-regulators-exploring-bitcoin-connection-capital-flight/,"Though details are currently scarce, Chinese regulators are reportedly looking into the use of bitcoin to avoid capital controls. According to Tencent Finance, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) is exploring how bitcoin can be used to circumvent capital flight. The news website cited unnamed sources close to regulators, and Tencent’s report was later cited by Bloomberg. The report emerges in the wake of statements from China's central bank, which said today that it had met with domestic bitcoin exchanges this week, warning them about adhering to state regulations. It also comes as Chinese officials weigh instituting additional capital controls on top of existing constraints amid an outflow of funds from the country, as reported last month by the South China Morning Post. BTCC, one of the exchanges that met with central bank officials, later released a statement confirming their communication with the People’s Bank of China.

                            Bitcoin-Powered Internet Advances With $4 Million Blockstack Funding                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/blockstack-4-million-funding-series-a/,"A new version of the Internet built on the bitcoin blockchain is another step closer to reality thanks to a $4m investment in Blockstack revealed in SEC documents earlier this week. The three-year old project leverages the bitcoin blockchain to build a new Internet free of centralized servers and with a browser that enables users to control their own identities. Based in New York, the company behind the effort is already building a browser for this new Internet, and the four-person team plans to use the funds to finalize a single, unified platform with which developers can build a new network of sites. But in conversation with CoinDesk, Blockstack's co-founders emphasized the investment won't just help build their own platform. According to the team, the money is an investment in every other company already using the technology and those in the future looking to help build this new Internet. Blockstack co-founder Ryan Shea told CoinDesk: Firms already building with the company's technology include a wide range of bootstrapped projects, venture-backed startups and global software providers. Among a total of about a dozen firms publicized so far are decentralized marketplace, OpenBazaar, blockchain-based record startup Tierion, and as of last May, software giant Microsoft, which partnered with ConsenSys to build a decentralized identity platform capable of running across blockchains. The investment led by returning investor Union Square Ventures will be used to grow the team's size from four full-time employees to as many as 10, continue work on a single unified development platform, and in the coming months, launch a new kind of web browser. Other investors are Lux Capital, which participated as a secondary lead investor, Naval Ravikant, Digital Currency Group, Compound, Version One, Kal Vepuri and Rising Tide. In total, the startup has raised $5.3m to date. For those new to the company, Blockstack launched in 2013 as OneName, an identity platform that in its early days logged verified identities directly in the bitcoin blockchain. The technology in its current incarnation is designed to be blockchain agnostic, but it is largely comprised of work the startup had done with the bitcoin blockchain. In addition to learning that the method of logging directly in the bitcoin blockchain didn't scale well, Shea and his co-founder Muneeb Ali discovered that giving users an identity to own was only as useful as the places it could be used. So in May 2016, the duo rebranded as Blockstack, an homage to the layer of services they were now working to build, which they say, amounts to a new Internet. The foundational layer of the Blockstack is the bitcoin blockchain itself, which Ali calls the ""base layer of discovery"". On top of that is a naming protocol that functions in place of the '.com' and '.org' designations on the traditional internet. In their place are domains such as '.id' for a personal user identity and '.iot' for the internet of things. A six-letter, alphabetic-only namespace costs 0.001 BTC and a bitcoin deposit is required before some tasks can be completed.    On top of the ID layer is an authentication layer that automatically verifies users without websites needing to keep a database of their users' personal information. On top of that is a storage layer where users connect to their own storage from Dropbox, Google Drive, or iCloud, enabling a complete browsing experience where the sites know only what the users want and those same users are empowered to collect and store their own data. So far, 67,000 people have gone through the free process of verifying their identities on Blockstack, a required step before browsing can occur. Last year, Tim Berners Lee, who is credited for inventing the World Wide Web, created his own Blockstack ID, and days later, expressed his personal interest in the work. ""We are really trying to enable this new world where users and developers have this direct relationship and users are in direct control of their identities,"" said Shea. Before any meaningful revenue can be generated from the concept, however, Blockstack needs focus on continuing to build out its community and release more software, according to Albert Wenger, lead investor in the round at Union Square Ventures and a long time student of identity protection. In conversation with CoinDesk, Wenger said that as more and more people build on and use Blockstack, value propositions will present themselves organically. The decision not to focus on revenue now is part of a bigger strategy Wenger says his firm built through its work with previous, high profile portfolio members. ""We’re not spending a lot of time thinking about that right now,"" said Wenger, adding: Crucial to Blockstack’s push to grow users and release new software is the Blockstack browser itself. Once it goes live in the coming months, according to Muneeb, users will be able to download the software. This will automatically change their DNS settings across all their preferred browsers, making them instantly compatible with the new Internet. Muneeb concluded: Disclaimer: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstack. Stacked-block image via Shutterstock

The People’s Bank of China (PBoC) released twin statements this morning, outlining that it had met this week with representatives from BTCC, as well as Huobi and OKCoin – exchanges which host the majority of global bitcoin trading today – and warned them about remaining in compliance with state laws and regulations. The digital currency’s price also fell below the $900 mark amid the news. BTCC said that its representatives “work closely” with officials from the PBoC “to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China”. The exchange said: BTCC went on to note that users “should be aware of the current policies on virtual goods”, as well as the associated trading risks. As previously reported, the PBoC developments somewhat mirror circumstances from late 2013, when the central bank told domestic financial institutions to avoid using bitcoin. At the time, the warnings raised fears of Chinese government interference in the bitcoin sector and sent prices reeling across global exchanges.

Bitcoin Price Slips Below $900 Amid China News                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/deja-vu-bitcoin-price-slips-900-amid-china-news/," The price of bitcoin has declined more than 11% already today, a development that comes amid a week of high market volatility. The movements are the latest in a week of trading that has seen the price of the digital currencyÂ nearing all-time highs before falling nearly $200 in a matter of hours and laterÂ recovering. At press time, the price of bitcoin is averagingÂ $899.00 across global exchanges, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). The news also notably follows a decision by the People's Bank of China (PBoC), China's central bank, to publicly disclose that it had issued warnings to major exchanges in the country or otherwise discussed their practices within a legal context. Representatives from BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi â marketplaces that account for the bulk of the world's bitcoinÂ volumes, according to data from Bitcoinity â met with PBoC officials earlier this week. CNY-denominated markets are down more than 9% from the dayâs high. Average prices are currently Â¥5,856.40, BPI data shows. Observers have suggested that the price may remain depressed while the PBoC news is absorbed by the market, though they struck a largely bullish tone long term. That said, the story raises the specter of Chinese regulatory involvement in the bitcoin space, the threat of which sent bitcoin markets plunging in late 2013Â after the Chinese central bank issued warnings toÂ domestic financial institutions. However, it remains uncertain whether the China news is directly correlated with the movements, as it was in 2013. Bitcoin's price first began to slip today at around 8:00 UTC, when prices dropped nearly $30 in one hour. News of the PBOC's actions, by comparison, don't seem to have impacted social media discussion until 11:00 UTC, when posts began appearing on the social media networks Twitter and Reddit. Nonetheless, comments suggest that some may be using the news as a way to influence markets or otherwise gauge their short-term trading strategies given past precedent. Image via Shutterstock

Officials from the People's Bank of China (PBOC) met with representatives of major bitcoin exchanges this week to urge their compliance with ""relevant laws and regulations"", according to statements from the central bank. In total, two press releases were issued today, one by the PBOC's office in Beijing, the other by its Shanghai regional office, in which they revealed the meetings, as well as some information about what was discussed behind closed doors. Representatives from BTCC, OKCoin and Huobi were all in attendance, according to documents. OKCoin was cited under its Chinese-facing brand name. Overall, the public statements aimed to serve as a reminder to citizens who may be considering the digital currency as an investment, and both quoted a government circular released in 2013 saying that bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status. The comments come at a time when bitcoin prices have been highly volatile, rising to near all-time highs only to decline by more than $250 within a few hours of trading. An informal translation of the document reads: The remarks come at a time when capital flight has emerged as a major concern in China, though it remains uncertain if this topic either influenced or was discussed during the meetings. Representatives from BTCC responded to press inquiries, but initially declined further comment citing business confidentiality. The exchange has since released a statement, which can be found here. Officials at Huobi and OKCoin were contacted, but at press time, have yet to respond publicly to the news.

At the close of CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) for 5th January, the price of bitcoin was $1,005.82, a figure that was up more than $100 from earlier in the day. At roughly 14:00 UTC, bitcoin suffered a sudden and sharp selloff, plunging close to $200 in a movement that sparked headlines around the globe. The decline was all the more shocking to many, as it came just after hours of trading within $20 of the all-time high set in 2013. Petar Zivkovski, chief operating officer at cryptocurrency exchange Whaleclub, emphasized the severity of the decline, telling CoinDesk: Yet, following these extreme price movements, the digital currency has been far more calm, comparatively, fluctuating largely between roughly $930 and $990. At close of day, bitcoin prices were again trading above $1,000, though they were about 11% lower than the opening price of $1,129.87. Even after this sharp decline, however, bitcoin prices may have more further to go, according to cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff. ""Bitcoin is still way up over the last month, and could certainly slide more,"" he told CoinDesk. ""A robust price rise needs to be built on a base of long-term users (or at least holders), and I've seen no evidence of such a constituency behind the last month's rise."" Eliosoff is not alone in his assessment either, as commentators are beginning to suggest that the digital currency may be overbought. Calm in storm image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's Rollercoaster 2017: What's Happened So Far                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-rollercoaster-2017-heres-missed/," 2016 may have been a dynamic year for the price of bitcoin, but 2017 is shaping up to be a dramatic one already. Bitcoin's race past $1,000 (and subsequent gyrations above and below that line) have already sparked headlines (both good and bad) worldwide, as today's dramatic fall from above $1,100 drove a massive influx of interest in the the digital currency. If you’re just tuning in to the action, you may be wondering how things got to this point in the first place. To get you up to speed, it may be helpful to look back at the past week's major price developments that took exchange markets near new all-time highs – and, as today showed, dramatic lows. Here's the blow-by-blow for 2017 thus far:  The year got started with a bang on 1st January, when the price of bitcoin crossed the $1,000 mark. After spending the day approaching that level – climbing as high as $999 before settling back down – the price climbed to its then-highest point since January 2014. The movement was notable given less-than-average trade volume figures at the time. Conversely, in the days before, bitcoin prices had approached (but not quite exceeded) $1,000. Read more here.  Things began heating up within a few short days. As reported by CoinDesk on 4th January, early trading this week saw the digital currency’s price drift ever higher after crossing the $1,000 line. A high of $1,060 meant that the price was inching closer to its all-time high of $1,165.89, reached on 30th November, 2013, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). It was during this time as well that mainstream media sources, including The New York Times and The Washington Post began taking note, which continues to today Read more here.  The price, as may be expected, continued to climb that day. Bitcoin shot above the $1,100 line in late-day trading on 4th January, quickly spiking to as much as $1,129.28 before settling back. CNY-denominated markets saw sharp gains that day as well, surging more than 23%. A notable development at that point was the emergence of sell-side pressure in markets like Bitfinex. As reported at the time, there were more sell orders than buy orders between the $1,137 and $1,140 – potentially foreshadowing the developments to come. Read more here.  4th January continued to surprise with heightened volatility, with markets seeing some of the day’s gains lost before re-reaching them once more as trading continued. The day saw prices climb as high as $1,141.05 during the session, the highest total since 5th December, 2013, according to BPI data. Yet prices fell as low as $1,087.53 before climbing once more, signaling that there could be more volatility to come. It was here that at least some observers – who previously had indicated broadly bullish sentiment – began to suspect that a market pullback was on the horizon. Read more here.  Today, opened with significant gains, as the price climbed as high as $1,153.02 – well within striking distance of the all-time BPI high. As reported this morning, the market behavior seen seemed to follow a pattern previously exhibited the day prior. That is to say, sharp movements upward before consolidation. One noticeable change was a shift to more buy orders on exchanges like Bitfinex, potentially signaling that the price of bitcoin would climb even further. Read more here.  This morning’s dramatic price plunge, however, would cast a shadow on those bullish sentiments. Just hours after climbing closer to the all-time high set in 2013, market averages suddenly tumbled. Markets had been fluctuating between the $1,080 and $1,070 lines, according to BPI data, before falling to as low as $887.47. Overall, USD-denominated markets fell as much 23%, with CNY-denominated markets tumbling more than 15% as well. However, in the hours since, the price of bitcoin has recovered. At press time, the average market price is $978.25.  Of course, we'd be remiss to note that bitcoin is an open-source technology – meaning, tweaks to its core protocol are ongoing. Amidst all the ups and downs, a number of bug fixes were released that showcase how bitcoin could continue to evolve and become more useful, even in the face of challenges. Read more here.

                            Volatility and Liquidity: How Bitcoin Compares to its Crypto Competitors                        ",Willy Woo,https://www.coindesk.com/network-effects-volatility-liquidity-bitcoin-versus-payment-coins/,"Willy Woo is an entrepreneur, angel investor, derivatives trader and cryptocurrency enthusiast. In this opinion piece, Woo takes readers on a deep dive into the historical performance of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that he believes already compete against it as general purpose consumer ""payment coins"".   2016 has been a bull year for privacy-focused cryptocurrencies. Just as an example, last year we saw the rapid appreciation of monero, the mega-hyped launch of zcash (which peaked at an astounding $5,300 per coin) and subsequent pumps in other similar offerings including shadowcash and navcoin. But, while it may seem like these crypotcurrencies are something new or novel, I would argue that all of these are ""payment coins"" competing in the battle to win the war to be general money. Let me explain. While most altcoins tend to be forging into market specific ""appcoin"" territory, what makes payment coins unique is the sheer size of the potential win. While appcoins can only capture a market segment that effectively puts a cap on their valuation, payment coins being a kind of generalized money can capture ""M2 money supply"" as a ceiling – ie trillions. When I look at payment coins, I see that very strong economic network effects are in play. As I covered earlier with my Commerce Index, liquidity and low volatility are very important for a coin to be useful for general trade as both of these qualities are crucial to make it compelling for end consumers to charge their wallet with a payment token for spending. With high volatility, there’s too much risk holding funds, and with insufficient liquidity, wallet recharge and merchant fees will be high. When looking at the combined qualities of liquidity and price stability together as a Commerce Index, we could see other coins catching up with Bitcoin. In this study I will be doing a deeper dive into these two qualities individually. For the sake of this study, I will be looking at the leading coins by market cap, namely bitcoin, monero, dash, Zcash and ShadowCash. All of these coins are well above $5m market cap, navCoin and others at less than $3m have been excluded.  The plot above shows the liquidity (weekly traded volume) of each payment coin. For the sake of comparing apples with apples, the Chinese zero-fee markets for bitcoin have been ignored as volumes can be faked easily. If we had included them, you can multiply bitcoin's volumes by 10x to 100x. The liquidity of alternative payment coins has been on a rapid rise in 2016, particularly in the case of monero (which if this year’s trend continues could match bitcoin in just one year). But, there’s an argument here that liquidity can climb quickly upon the introduction of a new currency as can be seen by the steep liquidity growth of bitcoin in its first two years. Of note is Zcash’s introduction which opened with remarkable liquidity, levels similar to what monero and dash enjoy today but which took them two to three years to achieve. It's pretty clear that liquidity can be won very quickly. Arguably achieving low volatility is more important than sheer liquidity as this is key to mass adoption. Consumers need to be sure a payment currency is stable before charging their wallets. If the token price swings wildly like we saw in bitcoin's early days, we would see very few people holding it in their wallets, and no chance for user adoption. It’s the prerequisite – if nobody is using your coin because of high volatility, then who cares if you have liquidity to assist in lowering merchant fees. In this section, I’ll plot each payment coin’s volatility trend. Bitcoin Volatility  In a previous volatility study, I established that bitcoin is well on the path to being the most stable currency in the world, an astounding claim, one that surprised even me. Yet, when I break down the mechanism in which price stability is achieved, it makes sense. Price stability happens at the exchanges. If you want to buy or sell a currency, and there’s millions of buyers or sellers on the other side of the market wanting to take your order, you will see a very small change in price movement from your trade. When we look at fiat forex markets, the orders comprise of speculative trade, international trade and remittances. National trade within a currency never hits the forex exchanges. But with bitcoin nearly all merchant and remittance activity worldwide hits the exchanges to convert to fiat, thus the potential for a much deeper order book. Another way to say this that with bitcoin, every cup of coffee you buy, anywhere in the world adds to market stability. Its ceiling on stability should be orders of magnitude higher than fiat currencies. The study concluded bitcoin would achieve fiat level volatility by mid-2019, which in my opinion is a level that will create a positive feedback loop that leads to more mainstream comfort with the currency. This should open the way for bitcoin as a viable mainstream currency for the use of day to day commerce, further increasing its stability. A side conclusion was that payment startups such as BitPay are too early, and that their time will come in 2-3 years. Monero Volatility  First up in our alternative payment coin list is monero, the biggest payment coin behind bitcoin. Unfortunately, monero over its 2.5-year history has shown an increasing trend in volatility, and we've seen a lot more speculators pushing the price around during its 2016 price breakouts. Here, we see how keeping liquidity high and volatility low can be like pulling on opposite ends of a tug-o-war. Often high volatility attracts traders which then feeds an increase in liquidity. Though monero may be losing out on reduced volatility, it has a very important feature. Unlike dash, zcash and shadowcash, it is unique in that it is not a fork of bitcoin, so it has a chance of winning the payment coin war by competitor implosion should there be a vulnerability in bitcoin’s codebase. In this regard, monero is an excellent bitcoin hedge in my opinion. Dash Volatility  Dash was pleasantly surprising, showing a volatility reduction in line with bitcoin, and a slowly climbing liquidity rate, that if sustained, could catch bitcoin in one to two years. In terms of lag, dash is about 18 months behind bitcoin in volatility, but unlikely to catch up if its present trend continues. Last time I checked, 65% of dash is locked up in MasterNode staking, which creates a flow of currency to MasterNode owners, also 10% of block rewards are spent to develop the network. This flow of currency could be responsible for dash's lower volatility. The theory is that currency flowing to more people should add more depth and more even distribution to the order books of dash, and that it’s these two properties that ultimately reduces volatility. ZCash Volatility ZCash is the new kid on the block, at barely six weeks old, it’s not had enough time in the market to even calculate a single 60-day volatility point on a chart. I ran a check of 30-day volatility, and it varied between 90% and 9500%. That’s literally off the charts, so we'll need wait some time before we see any meaningful trends. ShadowCash Volatility  Shadowcash, like dash, is making inroads with liquidity, with just over two years to match bitcoin liquidity if 2016 trends can be sustained. From our two years of history on this coin, we can see a slight reduction in volatility, but not at any rate that will catch up with bitcoin. Like dash, this coin allows staking with a 3-4% return for holders compared to dash’s 10-11% returns. This could be the reason for SDC’s proportionally smaller decline in volatility compared to dash. I started this study to double check my assumptions that bitcoin was well ahead of the pack in network effects. What the data showed was this was only partly true. Bitcoin’s lead in liquidity is not unassailable, monero could match it in a year, while dash and shadowcash could achieve it in just over two. This ignores bitcoin's zero-fee markets, which are colossal so perhaps it’s not a fair comparison. Probably the most accurate comparison would be to look at on-chain transaction volume which is difficult data to get, involving estimates of transaction values (technically, an estimate of change outputs back to the sender). Interestingly, dash and shadowcash’s staking mechanisms (which distribute payouts to more participants than just miners) seem be making a significant difference in reducing volatility. This is in no way conclusive, but in theory it makes sense. All of bitcoin’s competitors tote features that bitcoin is lacking – faster confirmation times and private payments. Both of these features will most likely be coming to bitcoin as layer two protocols in 2017. If and when this happens, the battle for payments and general money will be fought solely on the playing field of economic network effects, that of liquidity and volatility. Bitcoin remains the standout contender in this regard. This article originally appeared on Woo's blog and has been republished with his permission.

                            Bitcoin Freefall: Prices Drop Nearly $200 in 1 Hour                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-freefall-prices-drop-200/," Bitcoin prices tumbled sharply this morning. According to data from CoinDesk's Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), market averages dropped abruptly only days after passing the $1,000 mark on 1st January. This morning's decline came after prices reached a high of $1,153.02 in early morning trading. Still, despite coming within reach of all-time highs, prices fell more than 20% across global exchanges before recovering. Markets were fluctuating near $1,071 before reaching a brief low of $887.47, the lowest figure observed on the BPI since 25th December. At press time, the average price of bitcoin was $958.31, a decline of more than 15% from the day's peak. The movements marked a sharped contrast from yesterday's trading sessions. Then, prices surged past the $1,100 mark, a rally that saw markets climb more than 10% over the course of the day. At the time, however, sell order pressure kept markets below the all-time high, leading some analysts to predict that prices could fall sharply in the face of additional pressure. Meanwhile, CNY-denominated markets fell more than 15% from the start of the day, dropping to a low of ¥6,160.68. BPI data reports that CNY markets are trading at an average of ¥6,644.34 at press time. Today's price move raises the question of whether the rally that began last month will continue into the new year – or if we're in for a repeat of 2013-2014, when bitcoin peaked and quickly fell. One might be tempted to look at the steadily rising markets over the past few weeks – in mid-December, the price hadn’t yet crossed the $800 line – but this metric is only part of the equation. The answer to whether the current bitcoin rally is sustainable may lie in the volume numbers, or the amount of money traded per day across global bitcoin exchanges. At least one exchange operator reported that the volume picture is different this year than it was during the last market high in late 2013, which saw prices cross the $1,100 mark before tumbling over the months to come. When reached for comment, representatives from Chinese bitcoin exchange Huobi – which boasts nearly a quarter of the world’s bitcoin trading market share – said that the situation is very different from three years ago. Exchange reps told CoinDesk: The firm added: ""Current trading volume is 37x of that in 2013 and bitcoin price fluctuates 15.95%, which is much more stable than the year 2013."" Data from Bitcoinity, too, suggests that trade volume is higher today overall than it was during that period. The number of trades per minute, as shown in data provided by the site, points to a fundamentally different picture – though the higher velocity could swing markets in either direction depending on momentum. Ultimately, market watchers may just have to wait and see what happens next. Image via Shutterstock

                            Will 2017 Bring an End to Bitcoin's Great Scaling Debate?                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/2016-bitcoin-protocol-block-size-debate/,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, CoinDesk contributor Corin Faife recaps developments in bitcoin's biggest technology debate.   In bitcoin's early days, discussion of the protocol was almost the only thing that mattered – and 2016, it could be said, has brought this discussion back to center stage. The reason has been the continued focus on network scalability, more specifically whether modifying bitcoin's block size is the right way to increase the number of transactions the network can process. It's important to note that to some, the continued ""debate"" isn't really a debate at all. As evidenced at the technology's annual developer summit, there remains a strong (if not overwhelming) consensus that a proposal called Segregated Witness is the best solution – if it is approved, it will nearly double bitcoin's capacity. Yet, a vocal minority continues to remain opposed (partly over disagreement about ""Satoshi's vision"" and partly due to trust issues with Bitcoin Core, its primary volunteer developer team). As such, the argument over the pros and cons of this proposal has still not been conclusively resolved. While bitcoin's price has once again returned to its 2013 highs, it could be said that only one number matters in 2017, the percentage of miners that agree to upgrade to a version of the protocol featuring the SegWit upgrade. The progress of developments (like the much-hyped Lightning Network), as well as the business models of many startups, arguably depend on SegWit's implementation. Against this backdrop, 2017 is likely to prove a pivotal year. For now, let's look at how the debate unfolded in 2016, along with the related projects and personalities that fed into it. The debate over block size and scalability was already contentious in 2015, but the main difference was that a range of proposed solutions were on the table and the partisan lines were less clear. Then, in December 2015, Blockstream co-founder and developer Pieter Wuille introduced a proposal called Segregated Witness, which would increase network throughput without modifying block size by changing the way that transactions were stored in order to use less space. Also beneficial, developers argued, was that it could be introduced via a mechanism called a soft fork (meaning that miners who adopted it could co-exist on the network with those that did not). As evidenced by ethereum this year, a hard fork could risk splitting the economic network into two incompatible versions. (Opponents claim that a hard fork is more democratic, as it allows voting and the possibility of two outcomes). Following the release of the Segregated Witness white paper, proposed solutions to the scalability problem were effectively flattened into two groups: those who wanted an increase in block size (with a further debate over what the ideal size was), and those who wanted to maintain block size while improving efficiency in other areas. So, 2015 rolled into 2016 with a far more polarized version of the debate than had previously been seen. This initially left Bitcoin Core developers who supported the Segregated Witness solution scrambling to do a better job of clarifying their position, with the launch of a website, Twitter feed, and Slack channel to bridge perceived communication gaps. Meanwhile, support for the alternative path gathered steam with the release of Bitcoin Classic in February, a repackaging of the Bitcoin Core software which would double the maximum block size from 1MB to 2MB. Yet at almost exactly the same time, another power bloc emerged in the form of a consortium of miners and exchanges who declared that they would not back any proposal resulting in a hard fork of the network, throwing doubts over the viability of getting Bitcoin Classic off the ground. Toward the mid-point of the year, a group of about 20 contributors to the Bitcoin Core code met in Zurich to review the Segregated Witness code. Held in late May, the meeting brought the distributed group of developers together to discuss the code itself, and broader issues of strategy and communication for the roll-out of the code. Not long afterwards, the Bitcoin Core developers merged the Segregated Witness code into the master branch of the bitcoin codebase, allowing for a new round of testing of the code on the bitcoin testnet. With momentum firmly behind them at this stage, and after a few more months of testing the Core, developers announced that version 0.13.0 of the Bitcoin Core software would include SegWit code, albeit in a pre-activation state that could be triggered with a subsequent update. The version also included faster block relays on the network, among other technical updates. Meanwhile, in July, an upgrade to the bitcoin network's block relay structure was also announced. The project was an improvement to the Bitcoin Relay Network, a system developed to boost the speed at which block data was propagated amongst bitcoin miners and thereby reduce the incidence of orphan blocks. When the Bitcoin Relay Network began to ‘show its age’, bitcoin developer and Blockstream co-founder Matt Corallo redesigned its successor – the Fast Internet Bitcoin Relay Engine – using the UDP protocol instead of TCP, allowing for even faster data transmission between nodes. Even after the strides of progress seen by the Bitcoin Core team, the last months of the year were to prove that consensus is still proving to be hard fought. One of these hurdles came in the form of ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com owner Roger Ver, two influential opponents to the Bitcoin Core roadmap, both of whom have a stake in the protocol's mining network. In late October, ViaBTC switched from using Bitcoin Core to Bitcoin Unlimited, a rival software client backed by Ver that does not include support for Segregated Witness. Instead, it tackles the problem of scaling by introducing a configurable maximum block size which can be defined by individual miners. (For an easily digestible explanation of how this works, see Peter Rizun's post on how a Bitcoin Unlimited node deals with large blocks). Given that Segregated Witness needs to be backed by 95% of the hashing power of the network in order to be adopted, any mining pool commanding 5% of the hashing power or more can effectively block the process, leaving progress towards scalability at an impasse. This is more or less where the end of the year leaves us: with a widespread support for Segregated Witness, but a small and vocal minority of opponents holding out against it. At the time of writing, over 50% of bitcoin nodes are running the SegWit-compatible 0.13.0 or 0.13.1 software according to Bitnodes, yet over 7% of nodes are running some version of Bitcoin Unlimited – a large enough share of mining power that the network might not be able to switch. However, even with the scales so heavily weighted toward Bitcoin Core, the story is far from over. If and when the network adopts Segregated Witness, the 1.8x increase in transaction volume may buy only a finite amount of time before familiar limitations start to resurface. Though it could be argued that keeping an artificial cap could force innovation in other areas, most (if not all) developers believe the block size will one day need to rise. With this in mind, in 2017 and beyond, it seems certain that the 'block size debate' will continue. Orange pipes image via Shutterstock

At press time, bitcoin prices had increased $10 during the first hours of the day's session to top $1,140, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. The upward movements follow a pattern observed on 4th January, when the digital currency's price appreciated sharply after crossing $1,100 before meeting resistance at $1,140. With the move, global exchange averages are again within striking distance of the previous all-time high of $1,165.89 set on 30th November, 2013. Also notable is bitcoin's highest-ever single exchange listing of $1,242, observed on the now-defunct exchange Mt Gox. Yet, bitcoin prices have faced resistance as they have approached both historic benchmarks. In the last 24 hours, more than 52% of BTC/USD orders on Bitfinex have been buy orders, according to BFXdata, though sell orders had mounted in yesterday's sessions. Still, developments could lie ahead. As of 4:15 UTC, buy orders accounted for 77% of all trades on Bitfinex, suggesting upward pressure could be poised to mount.

                            Sell Orders Slow Bitcoin Rally as All-Time High Remains Elusive                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/sell-orders-halt-bitcoin-rally-time-high-remains-elusive/," Bitcoin prices surged today, breaching $1,100 and rising to their highest average since 2013 before falling back and surrendering gains. The digital currency’s price managed to climb more than 10% during the day, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), however, data reveals that this rally ran into a high number of sell orders. By 21:45 UTC, the percentage of sell orders made through cryptocurrency exchange Bitfinex over the previous hour exceeded 75%, data from BFXdata showed. The data point is the first sign that investor confidence could be waning after weeks of steady gains. With this in mind, cryptocurrency fund trader Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk he believes that bitcoin is currently overbought, and that bitcoin could head back down as low as the $800 range. Eliosoff said: Overall, bitcoin prices rose to as much as $1,141.05 during the session, their highest total since 5th December, 2013, BPI figures reveal. By the time they had reached this daily peak, bitcoin prices had come within $25 of their all-time high set on 30th November, 2013. Shortly after, the digital currency declined to a local low of $1,087.53, before later climbing back to $1,108.64, BPI data shows. While it's unclear if this current ""bull run"" is over, several market analysts were quick to position the rally as an extension of improvements in bitcoin as a technology and an ecosystem. ""This rally has been a long time coming. I think it's telling that right now the biggest problem facing bitcoin is how to deal with all the demand it is facing,"" former cryptocurrency exchange employee Zane Tackett said. At one point during the day's trading session, GDAX, the digital currency exchange operated by startup Coinbase went down, a factor the company attributed to higher-than-average volumes. Other exchange operators were quick to note that they believe the price appreciation is due to ""new money"" entering the market, while emphasizing that data shows overall sentiment is strong.

                            SEC Delays Winklevoss Bitcoin ETF Again                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/sec-bitcoin-etf-decision-delayed-trump-transition/,"By the time Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss receive a final decision from the SEC on their long-proposed bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), a new president will be leading the US. Though an earlier 10th January deadline would have placed the decision by the SEC to approve or disapprove the Winklevoss brothers' request, paperwork filed today now extends the deadline to 11th March. While the extension isn't a surprise, one industry observer thinks the transition of power may have made it essential. Blockchain products lead at ARK Investment Management, Chris Burniske, said that SEC chair Mary Jo White's plans to leave with the departure of President Barack Obama are likely just the beginning of the internal changes. Burniske told CoinDesk: This is just the latest extension the SEC has given itself to come to a final decision regarding the Winkelvoss ETF. Neither Cameron nor Tyler Winklevoss were able to comment on the decision due to restrictions from the regulator. While this is just the latest delay, it's important to note that the series of possible extensions permitted by law is capped at 240 days from the initial submission date in June 2016. Traditionally, the likely course the SEC will follow is either to approve the request or, in the days leading up to the decision, allow the brothers to bow-out gracefully.

                            Bitcoin Price Within $25 of New All-Time High                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-within-25-new-time-price-high/," Bitcoin prices are up $100 on the day, having already shot past the $1,100 mark. Markets have risen nearly 10% over the course of the day’s trading, according to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), which hit a high of $1,141 at time of writing before falling back. With the move, global exchange averages have inched closer to the BPI's all-time high of $1,165.89, set on 30th November, 2013, leaving them roughly $25 below that level. The digital currency's price appreciated sharply after crossing the $1,100 line, quickly spiking to a high of $1,129.28, before meeting some resistance. Bitcoin prices will likely face continued resistance as they approach the all-time high, as figures from BFXdata.com show that there are more sell orders than buy orders at many price points between $1,137 and $1,140. In the last 24 hours, more than 60% of BTC/USD orders on Bitfinex have been buy orders, according to BFXdata. Adding potential resistance, however, is that this figure has now fallen below 50% for the last hour. CNY-denominated markets are also notably up more than 23% for the day, currently averaging ¥8,219.03 after opening the day at ¥6,686.60. The price is currently at ¥7,293.60, BPI data shows. Bitcoin prices have surged since the start of the year, building on major gains seen at the close of 2016. Average bitcoin prices across global markets exceeded $1,000 on 1st January and have been edging upwards since. Image via CoinDesk BPI; Sad dog image via Shuterstock

                            New Bitcoin Software Update Boasts 55 Fixes                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/new-bitcoin-software-update-boasts-55-fixes/," Bitcoin's eighth birthday was marked by a new software update. Though all eyes may have been on the escalating price, Tuesday's software upgrade (to version 0.13.2) is the latest of many ""minor version releases"" published by the volunteer developer group known popularly as Bitcoin Core. It might not be as big of a release as say, 0.13.0, but it rounds up a number of bug and performance fixes, including an upgrade that will allow the built-in wallet to react to memory pool (mempool) changes more appropriately. Other improvements include increased block relay speed on the network and changes that aim to make it easier for miners to adopt SegWit, the scaling solution that's been particularly contentious lately. Major releases add additional features, while minor releases generally polish on those releases by way of bug and performance fixes making the software more robust (although consensus rules are also sometimes added in minor releases). In total, 28 contributors made 55 changes merged into the release. Similar releases often need a few rounds of testing (which each manifest in a new ""release candidate""), but since no problems were reported since the first release candidate, the developer group packaged up and distributed it. To make the upgrade (which developers suggest doing for a performance boost), users need to turn off their full node, install the latest version, then restart it. Not everyone upgrades to the latest software, but roughly 53% of nodes are now running version 0.13.0 or newer. Meanwhile, the situation for the last release is arguably not ideal. While an upgrade featuring the SegWit activation code was released in late October, only about 25% of miners have signaled support for the change, far from the 95% that will trigger the update. Yet, despite this slow progress, this release indicates that developers are continuing to update the code. Along those lines, Bitcoin Core is continuing work on the next major version, 0.14.0, which could be released as early as March 2017. Generally, protocol developers appear to be focused on privacy and scalability improvements in the coming year. Watchmaker image via Shutterstock

In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Tripathi issues his predictions for the blockchain industry in the year ahead. The opinions expressed in this article are the personal opinions of the author at the time of publication and not of their employer. While these opinions may require significant computing power to change, they are certainly not immutable.   2016 might have been a good year for technology – but it was a difficult year for much else. The UK took a step back on free trade and immigration by voting to leave the EU (causing a fragile EU to teeter toward dissolution); the US elected a president whose transition saw daring squabbles with a country that owns over a trillion in its debt; each of the BRICs shot themselves in the foot (Brazil with corruption, India with demonetization, Russia with Crimea and China with non-performing loans); and the Middle East continued to burn like an oil well on fire. None of these disasters show signs of letting up in 2017. As the major currencies of the world start to tumble in 2017, the flight to quality will lead most investors back into the safety of gold. Some return-hungry ones will seek to exploit market inefficiencies and digital assets like bitcoin will draw a large enough segment of these investors, pushing bitcoin to double its current market cap.  When we do the math, $15bn is the kind of money that the Chinese or Saudi sovereign wealth can punt in their sleep… and I am pretty sure some will... If you are an asset manager, yes, I am talking about flight to quality, clientele effect and search for yield, all rolled in one. Now, who’d have thought one day the term 'flight to quality' will be used in the context of the same asset that people associated with drug dealing on the dark web a year ago? But then, the times, they are a changin’, and changin’ faster then ever. It seems safe to say a bitcoin price of $2,000 or more is likely. But in this uncertain world, it's hard to say what will happen in 2017. Here's my take on the blockchain scenarios we're likely to see. Paying for plumbing is an out-of-body experience where I live in London, and you’re blessed if the plumbing gets done at all. What does this have to do with blockchain? It turns out Brian Behlendorf is bang on the mark when he says that most blockchain startups have had to spend too much time and money on plumbing and would prefer to get on with building business solutions instead. This is exactly the path at least one reputed startup called Everledger has taken: use Hyperledger Fabric and spend their time tracking diamonds, bottles of wine and the like. This trickle of common sense is soon to become a flood. Lots and lots of other blockchain firms will start this migration from their own custom chain to everyone's plumbing chains. Around the end of Q1 2017, I expect Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 will finally arrive and private blockchains will start a rapid march toward enterprise readiness. Then, around September 2017, R3's Corda will be production ready and give the Fabric stiff competition in the financial sector. Soon afterwards, variants of ethereum like Quorum and Monax will start to mature and provide a highly resilient alternatives to Fabric and Corda. In the meantime, hard-boiled crypto companies like Blockstream and Blockchain will launch their enterprise-friendly platforms built on top of the bitcoin blockchain knowledge base and the Grand Ascot race of blockchains will begin. Other private permissioned blockchains will either be built for very specialized problems, such as Sawtooth Lake for IoT, or start to merge with one of the four major (bitcoin, ethereum, Hyperledger, Corda) ecosystems. Remember, we've have seen this before with Linux and Apache Web server coming to quietly dominate the Web without much fanfare. It hasn't taken savvy technologists long to recognize that the first killer apps for private blockchains are to be found in making supply chains more efficient. Let's face it, a technology upgrade of securities settlements or OTC clearing comes with $1tn dollar prize, but the guys who spend the money may not necessarily be the guys who take the spoils. Further, the volume of regulatory change required to enable settlements and clearing on a decentralized ledger architecture makes this a prospect only for the brave and the really well-funded. Similarly, we have learned from the travails of Ripple that being the company that gets paid an altcoin for each cross-border payment would be awesome*, but you need to convince banks or cash-rich platform businesses to let yours be that company. May the force be with Ripple. Elsewhere, insurers have tens of billions to gain from blockchain-led efficiencies in the London insurance market alone, but it's not an industry that has ever been in a rush to drive such efficiencies, mainly because of a relatively profitable industry structure and significant coordination costs, at least until now. Unlike within-industry consortia like R3 (that need to solve for the dynamics of 'coopetition'), supply chains are made of existing participants that have a natural incentive to collaborate and make the entire chain more efficient. Many supply chains also have one dominant player such as Disney, Walmart or Toyota that can force network effects and reap the bulk of the gains from their investment. These existing 'ecosystems' will start to adopt decentralized ledgers as a 'cross-enterprise-ERP' architecture first. Indeed, SAP and Oracle have a lot to gain... or lose, as IBM and Microsoft push the agenda on DLT. Editor's note: A Ripple representative contested this perception of its business model, stating: ""Ripple generates revenue by selling software and services to banks to help them dramatically improve their cross-border payment offerings and lower the costs of settlement."" The big fuss in 2015 was scalability. Almost every client I spoke to would say: ""But I heard bitcoin only does seven transactions per second"" and I'd say: ""But you are not building a decentralized currency for the public Internet, and by the way, have you heard about Tendermint?"" A year later, with lots of proofs-of-concept (PoCs) delivered, I don't get much trouble about scalability. Now, the ‘going concern’ is privacy. With the general data protection regulation (GDPR) on the horizon and the wariness of banks about sharing anything, privacy is such a big deal that both Hyperledger Fabric and Corda have spent barrels of intellectual fuel either solving, or working around the problem. In my opinion, privacy is a much harder problem to solve than scalability, but several approaches exist today that are appropriate depending on the business problem one is trying to solve. Alex Batlin of BNY Mellon has done a terrific job of outlining these on his blog, and the situation will go from hot air to product by the force of demand and ingenuity in 2017. Watching ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin and the crew in 2016 was like watching The Charge of the Light Brigade. We started the year with the rallying cry of 'Code is Law' and ended the year with the whimper of 'Legally Enforceable Smart Contracts', thanks to a $100m experiment called The DAO that broke the faith of the millions of true believers that worshipped the immutable public blockchain. A leading systems integrator immediately followed with chameleon hashes and editable blockchains, to which the response of the blockchain developer community was at best mixed. Then followed a series of hard forks and the mutiny of ethereum classic, leading many nurturing parent types to launch backyard barbecues to provide governance and many critical parent types to launch into moralizing speeches about the need for discipline amongst children. As a business advisor, I am platform neutral, but as a developer, I am closing my year with tremendous respect and optimism for ethereum. Unlike bitcoin (which takes pride in its value, but has taken two years to see SegWit in production), and unlike the emerging field of half-baked blockchains, the people in charge of ethereum are not afraid to make bold fixes and evolve the platform quickly, even at their financial peril. At this stage of maturity, this willingness to change and fix is the sign of a community that puts the dream before the money, and honestly, that's exactly how we got to the transistors, the mobile phone, the Internet and just about anything that has made our world a better place. It’s always the dream, not the dollars. I suspect that in 2017, ethereum will go live with its own version of proof-of-stake, fix several of the known bugs in EVM, probably clean up the mushroom forest of tools and implementations and make something that can be useful in the computer world rather than only on a world computer. I hate to confess that I am an unexcitable 40-year-old survivor of the dotcom boom and the financial crisis. All this while, I have seen people get really poor from booms and really rich from busts. It also works in the reverse. Not many thought leaders feel particularly excited about putting their head down and testing production code, and not many people working on real money spinners like to talk. To an outsider, this hype curve phenomenon appears as the endless bipolar psychology of the nerds. ""I have seen this before… yawn"", is the refrain. My Zen eyes have seen the same too, just the other way round. To an insider, boring is money. When people stopped talking about e-commerce, Amazon started growing like a rocket. When people stopped talking about search, online advertising became a multi-billion industry. Now, big data is so yesterday and data lakes are starting to go live. After years of disappointment, AI has become Siri, Alexa, recommendation engines and maps. For blockchain, 2017 is the year when dull ex-coders like me get to do real work, and the charming thought leaders move on to the next interesting thing. Those who are in the depth of blockchain today need to hang in with their teeth and let the excitement and the hot money wither away. Wait, this happened with bitcoin in 2016 – bitcoin became the honey badger of money. James Carlyle of R3 said this best at the Hyperledger meetup in London this month and I paraphrase: you need two assets to make decentralized ledgers truly useful, the first is cash and the second is identity. Talking about identity is like talking about religion, so let's talk about the secular notion of cash for now.  To use decentralized ledger tech in securities markets, you need true delivery versus payment (DVP). In order to do DVP, the cash leg must settle (ie arrive in the recipient’s account) without credit or market risk, which means you need a cash token backed by the governing central bank in the market you are operating in. No matter how many macroeconomic simulations have been attempted, I think general purpose cryptocurrency on a blockchain is a promising (but risky) economic experiment and no central bank should launch one without a clear roadmap starting with a very limited purpose. The logical place to start is a cash token similar to the utility settlement coin (USC) that banks can use to settle transactions ranging from securities trades and OTC derivatives to commercial mortgages and trade finance. My prediction is at least one OECD central bank will pilot the idea before end of year 2017. Despite this, it's likely we will still be stuck in arguments about whether identity belongs on a blockchain. As a utilitarian simpleton, my starting point for digital identity is a mere token shared by a retailer and a bank with open APIs for the mundane purpose of selling things that a user doesn't need but wants anyway.  I believe we need to solve this simple problem before we can address self-sovereign legal identity for over 7 billion people in the world.

The benefit of global, macro, near-impossible visions is that these visions make us attack the really hard problems that boring capitalists are too boring to pursue.  The verifiable claims project probably best represented by Evernym's Sovrin solution is an example of what self-sovereign identity for a global, public Internet of value needs to look like. Boring capitalists like me who are looking to solve the identity puzzle for the shameless material consumption of the masses can learn a lot from the vision espoused by Evernym.

Yet, unlike cash on blockchain (which excites almost no one from liberal arts), identity on the blockchain makes humanists and philosophers scream in a fit of rage. The only group that benefits either way is the lawyers, and since lots of lawyers of all feathers will be involved in any discussion of identity on the blockchain, progress will be glacial.

Come December 2017, we will have much better technology to deliver solutions for shared identity on the blockchain but not much progress in the real world.
 Again, we have seen this whole wave with bitcoin already. Three years ago, driven by FOMO and FUD, VCs of all sorts rolled into lots of startups that promised to 'disrupt banking with bitcoin'. This year, even the rather well-funded Circle has abandoned bitcoin without really abandoning it. For much of this year, bitcoin has been a bad word, and everyone, (including people building bog standard RDBMS), claim to be working on blockchain (definitely not bitcoin). All the excitement created by the theory of distributed ledgers has led anyone who's sold a company before to at least think about launching a bitcoin company. As a result, a lot of me-too companies without a half-decent business idea or technical capability are now working on blockchain. As the blockchain gold rush starts to calm down and the hype condenses into products, most of these investors will cut and run into the next hype – probably AI or IoT. This is my favorite prediction – even at the risk of becoming persona non grata at all the cool blockchain socials. Leaving aside the top 20 conferences such as Money2020, Ethereum's DevCon, CoinDesk's Consensus and Construct, Eurofinance and Sibos, it's not always been clear what value all the panels that I have myself been on have contributed to the society or the blockchain community. Alright, not all of us can build product and every emerging technology deserves a thriving ecosystem of media coverage, podcasts, panels and presentations to accelerate its progress. That said, I really don't think I have seen this kind of mass panel overdose since Hotmail went live in 1996 and people discovered free email on the Internet. In 2017, most business leaders will stop asking 'What is blockchain?', stop listening to sentences starting with THE blockchain, filter out the keywords, 'revolutionize', 'disrupt' and 'transform' and start asking how they can make money from this technology. That is when blockchain will start making money and blockchain conferences will start losing it.   Mystical book image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Moves Within Striking Distance of All-Time Price High                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-moves-within-striking-distance-time-price-high/," The price of bitcoin continued to inch upward today, reaching a press time high of $1,060 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index. In total, the global exchange average was the highest observed since 5th December, 2013, when bitcoin traded at a high of nearly $1,150. According to BPI data, the price remains just over $100 short of its all-time high of $1,165.89, reached on 30th November, 2013. Notably, the uptick occurred during a time of heightened interest for the digital currency, which has drawn media attention from publications including BBC News, The New York Times and The Washington Post since passing the $1,000 threshold on 1st January. Not all of the news of late has been positive, however, with the Financial Times going so far as to label bitcoin a ""pyramid scheme"". Despite this lack of press confidence, however, analysts largely remain bullish on the price, which has appreciated roughly $100 over the last seven days, a movement that effectively puts it within striking distance of its all-time highs. While bitcoin has been given a boost recently by macroeconomic factors, and its use in emerging markets, it remains to be seen if this rally will grow more speculative, and more volatile. At press time, volumes and prices still appear to be driven by China-based trading, with prices trending $40 higher on CNY exchanges, according to BPI data. High jump image via Shutterstock

Published on 2nd January, the note opines on the current state of regulation, arguing that rules for private blockchain use cases lag behind guidance for bitcoin – the digital currency it called the one blockchain application ""in practical operation"". The document's author, BBVA digital regulation manager Javier Sebastián, contends that regulation will be needed to oversee enterprise blockchain use cases. However, he acknowledged that the current ""exploratory phase"" the technology is in makes this difficult to address. Overall, the note argues for more immediate action to clarify issues that could hold back the launch of blockchain projects, calling for ""a legal framework in which its legal nature is defined, including the applicable jurisdictions and laws, as well as where responsibility lies in the event of error or malfunction"". Sebastián writes: Elsewhere, the author contends that clarity is needed in regards to the legal validity of records stored via a blockchain and whether smart contracts are legally enforceable. The research is the latest from the blockchain bank that emerged as one of the earliest institutional movers on the technology, investing in Coinbase and serving as a founding member of blockchain consortium R3CEV.

The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  This past week saw yet another move in the ongoing scuffle between the IRS and cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. If you haven't been following the story, here’s a summary: In November, the IRS presented Coinbase with a summons requiring the company to disclose client transactions between 2013 and 2015. Coinbase has hinted that they'd rather not. Shortly thereafter, a Coinbase customer presented a motion against the IRS, alleging the subpoena was too broad. This week, the IRS responded, saying what effectively amounted to ""go away"". It claims that since this client has identified himself as a Coinbase user, he is now excluded from the original summons, and his motion is irrelevant (which would make sense if all they wanted was the clients’ names, but the summons asks for much more than that). This case has the bitcoin community understandably concerned. Aside from the violation of privacy, there is the strong impression that this is prosecutorial. Simply through association with Coinbase, clients appear to be under IRS suspicion. The IRS is probably only after high-net-worth individuals, but the damage is done. If the request is successful, bitcoin users and businesses are likely to feel vulnerable, even when they've done nothing wrong. But, the potential harm in terms of sentiment is not the most pressing concern. A deeper issue is insufficient regulation. According to a November report from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the IRS does not have a coherent virtual currency strategy. When policy isn't being put to practice, this leads to confusion and unpredictability, neither of which create a good environment for development. Usually, businesses and individuals are willing to comply with reasonable rules. Not knowing what those rules are leads to unnecessary expenditure and reluctance to engage. Yet even that isn’t the main problem. A bigger concern is that we don’t know how to regulate cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin is eight years old, and lawmakers still don't have a clear idea of what to do about it. That's not to say progress isn't being made. Several institutions and governments are studying the problem, establishing working groups and publishing papers. A few seem to be moving down a path that the respective local ecosystems appear happy with. To be fair, virtual currencies are still a minuscule part of the world economy, so they understandably haven't been a priority. Their presence is growing, however, and the disruptive threat is becoming more obvious. Also, we are facing completely new circumstances. History is not lending us a hand here. Never before have we had such interpersonal connectivity, and the fallout from lack of control over information is not limited to the field of finance. Add to the mix the slippery concept of bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies, and the confusion becomes even more understandable. They don't belong to any specific jurisdiction, no-one controls them, and no official organization can influence where they go. Which brings us to the question: Is it possible to regulate this new technology? It helps to consider what type of regulation we want, and what it is we're trying to control. Consumer protection rules already exist in many jurisdictions. Anti-money laundering disclosure requirements are already part of the financial landscape. Neither are technology-specific. Tax evasion isn’t, either. Cryptocurrencies may provide a vehicle, but the tech is not the problem here. The IRS move against Coinbase isn't about bitcoin – it’s about lack of information. The implied threat and the accompanying publicity of the legal action will push some transactions elsewhere, perhaps to less cooperative environments. In the process, it threatens to damage a young network with significant potential to contribute to economic development. Clear guidelines on disclosure requirements for individuals and businesses will help avoid the collateral damage from shortsighted summonses, but a sharper focus on what really matters will help clarify what rules are needed. Just as this new technology is making us rethink the concept of value, so we need to re-evaluate what regulation is for, and what is needed to enforce it. The issue is not cryptocurrencies or even their uses. The issue is information: what is necessary, and who provides it. Boxing gloves image via Shutterstock

                            Why There's Still Hope for Bitcoin Remittance Companies                        ",George Harrap,https://www.coindesk.com/why-theres-still-hope-for-bitcoin-remittance-companies/,"George Harrap is the CEO of Bitspark, a Hong Kong-based cash-in, cash-out remittance service leveraging bitcoin and blockchain technology. In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Harrap gives a deep dive into his takeaways from nearly three years of running a bitcoin-based remittance startup. His conclusion? Bitcoin is still a game changer.   As of the end of 2016, we are now about seven years into the bitcoin experiment. In that time, remittances have gone from one of the most buzzed-about use cases for bitcoin to one that's billed as one of its biggest challenges. So, can bitcoin make an impact as an intermediary for exotic currencies not often traded? Can it help deliver cash on the ground quicker and cheaper? Well, it turns out there's a lot of ways to approach remittances – from private blockchains, consortiums, apps, FX dealers to decentralized cryptocurrencies. Let's explore some of them below. Traditional FX integrations Only a tiny minority of currencies are freely floated and exchangeable outside their country of origin (generally, it's the top eight currency pairs: USD, EUR, AUD, GBP, CAD, JPY, SGD, HKD). Prices are as good as they get here and spreads are tiny, but these are the currencies of rich countries, not of the recipient nations of remittances globally. There are of course other currencies that are freely traded. But, if we are to solve the issue of remittances globally, we would need close to 180 currencies to be able to be transacted easily and cost effectively, and this is not currently possible. So, FX providers and websites providing FX services are great for B2B payments between the above currencies, and there is an immense market for that. But, this is not the use case we are discussing, the use case we are interested in is that of cash distribution on the ground to individuals in currencies and countries that are often not well connected to the financial system. FX providers work fine, however, more is involved to deliver cash to the street corner where its needed by the recipient. P2P netting of payments As startups, TransferWise and CurrencyFair popularized this model, but banks have been doing it for decades. Essentially transactions going from A to B and B to A can be ‘matched’, and instead of actually transferring the money via the SWIFT network, you can keep currency A and B in-country. The ownership of those balances will then change to be withdrawn domestically via lower cost domestic withdrawal methods. It's a neat idea, but it works only for the most frequently traded and transacted currency pairs where there is an equal amount going each way to 'match'. For the big remittance recipient countries, there are always more transactions going in than is coming out, so matching an equal number of transactions to and from is mathematically impossible. At the end of the day you will need to send money to the destination and how will you do that? Likely a bank-to-bank transfer, which for exotic currencies are always expensive. So you are not solving any problems here and will be subject to those higher exchange rates at the end of the day and will need to use traditional forms of settlement. P2P apps This model is still trying to establish itself via mobile apps, but fundamentally, it actually is based on an ancient system that has been in operation for thousands of years called ‘hawala’. Mobile apps try to make this more efficient by digitizing the connections between people that power the system. However, people need to trust the places they are putting in and receiving money. The usual workflow is deposit money with someone on the app, then the person at the other end will withdraw it from someone else at the recipient end. P2P apps generally want to try to connect you to people who can act as links in the chain nearby. However, some guy on the side of a street you track down via a dot on GPS doesn't exactly illicit trust. So, the logical conclusion is that you onboard trusted entities who deal in cash: the money transfer operators (MTOs, or physical cash money transfer shops), and MTOs are not about to ditch their complicated compliance and remittance system for a mobile app. Even if you assume the most optimistic scenario (where let's say people trust the guy by the side of the road), how will it be scalable for that person to handle hundreds or thousands of transactions via an app that will eventually attract the attention of government agencies? Getting money into and out of the app is the hard part. Hawala has been working for centuries, but it will just take time for people to adjust to applying it with new technologies. In our experience, we have found many foreign workers sending money home often have long established trust with the shop they send money home with or the guy on the motorbike who collects their cash at a construction site. Switching to something new is daunting, and it is also why bitcoin ATM-powered remittances haven't taken off. Nobody trusts new things. Private blockchains If you are a bank, a private blockchain may offer a few benefits to you in settling payments between your intermediaries or other banks. However, when other currencies are involved, the lines get blurred, and there is no way to avoid the global FX markets. If you have a tokenless blockchain (that is, a unit of account that does not have a floating open market price), there is no 'value' to transact across borders, it is merely a database entry on either your system or your connected intermediaries' – and this is possible without a blockchain. If you have a blockchain with an underlying value token, you need buy-in from entities in your private blockchain system other than yourself to act as counterparties and, regardless of how you structure it, it will never be as liquid as the global FX markets. There may be a case to be made for exotic currencies (which are not currently traded or adequately connected to global FX markets), but settling payments across currency pairs requires liquidity. A private blockchain requires buy-in from entities other than yourself, so the solution may be to setup a consortium to debit and credit balance between consortium members using a blockchain as an asset-tracking database. Consortiums in this space that might be set up to debit and credit payments between each other are an efficient way of settling payments, but it requires everyone to be on the same page (or ledger). Central bank blockchains I have previously theorized that the use of a blockchain-type system is inevitable for central banks – it offers them the control and oversight they require, while also removing inefficiencies in the existing monetary system. All private banks dealing in a national currency would also be participants in the blockchain and be running the same ledger – any transactional payment metadata can be associated with the blockchain transaction is built into the currency itself. This provides the benefits of a consortium described above (all on the same ledger debiting and crediting balances on the ledger) and also effectively handles end-of-day clearing. Central banks are not innovators (to say the least), so it will be slow for this to catch on. But I would argue such a move will be inevitable, as it aligns with their goals: more control over monetary policy and better oversight of their licensees. Various central banks have been talking about blockchain pilots and, as competition between jurisdictions in this space heats up (we are already seeing this with various 'FinTech rankings' of regulators), more are likely to follow. Using a token of value Physical money transfer shops have customers because they are trusted entities dealing with physical cash. Today, there are a few bitcoin-and-cash startups around the place, but we believe there is space for 10x more of them, in every country, in every currency. But, these brokers need to have access to local forms of payments. Maybe people in one country predominantly get their cash and pay bills, whereas other countries people pay with prepaid RFID cards. Whatever the payment method, it's important to have companies on the ground who understand this and can offer their services using the local mechanisms, while accepting bitcoin in exchange for these localized payments. The problem bitcoin solves here is reducing capital requirements. With bitcoin you don't need to take a $10m position to batch a small payment. You can transfer each individual $200 transaction individually for close to no cost internationally. Game changer! What if I want 5,000 Liberian dollars right now, how can I make that trade? Normally it requires various antiquated in-country mechanisms, bank contacts, accounts, shaking the right peoples hands and ultimately settlement through the US dollar – a very time-consuming and costly process. However, bitcoin is traded 24/7 around the world at the touch of a button. The ‘last mile’ is an essential part of this, and in our case, we connect all the existing last-mile providers and act as the bridge between them. We don't seek to disrupt their business, but to offer them new efficiencies. Pegged cryptocurrencies One of my favorites for a while now has been pegged cryptos, particularly the decentralized kind, like Nubits. (While the Nubits project has had some hiccups of late, I think the idea is intriguing.) Essentially these pegged cryptos are a token of value that adjusts automatically to market conditions to maintain a peg to a chosen fiat currency or commodity. However, it only works if its decentralized. If I have to trust any company or single entity along the way for a pegged crypto it becomes uninteresting and subject to all the common problems associated with holding customer funds. But, having 180 parallel FX assets can't be understated, this will be huge. If it costs me nothing to trade into and out of a token of value for exotic currencies, this will be a massive boon to the remittance industry. So, there you have it. The truth about bitcoin remittances is that the digital currency can and already does bring value to the remittance industry. It's providing a solution for trading into and out of exotic currencies. As a token of value it is reducing barriers to entry, simplifying back-office work for new companies in the space, and at the end of the day, providing superior pricing to end users – even when taking into account the last mile. As more people realize this, we believe we're in for exciting years ahead. Paper boats image via CoinDesk

                            Bitcoin Price Tops $1,000 in First Day of 2017 Trading                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-1000-january-1-2017/," The price of bitcoin inched upward over the course of trading today, passing $1,000 for the first time on CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index since early January 2014. Though the price (at press time) was still shy of a three-year high of $1,023 set in January of that year, the milestone nonetheless marks a bright beginning to 2017 for the digital currency. (Bitcoin appreciated by more than 100% in 2016). The price had reached as high as $999 earlier in the day only to fall back to the $960s, a pattern that was similarly observed over the last week of trading as bitcoin failed to build momentum toward $1,000. The increase notably took place during what was a day of lower-than-average trading volume, 7-day exchange data from Bitcoinity reveals. As asserted by analysts, 2017 is expected to be a banner year, one that could finally lead the price to pass its all-time high of $1,216.7 set in 2013.

",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/what-will-the-bitcoin-price-be-in-2017/,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk contributor Charles Bovaird asks experts for their predictions of bitcoin's price movements in the year ahead.   While bitcoin prices rose sharply in 2016, climbing to multi-year highs, they will likely push even higher in 2017, according to a panel of experts polled by CoinDesk. Propelled forward by numerous forces including strong market momentum, rising interest rates and an influx of new money, the digital currency’s price could surge to fresh, all-time highs next year, the analysts asserted. Bitcoin prices rose more than 100% in 2016, climbing from roughly $430 at the start of the year to $963.14 at around 19:00 UTC on 28th December, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data. When polled mid-December and asked where they thought bitcoin prices would finish out 2016, analysts pointed to factors such as market dynamics and macroeconomic uncertainty when explaining their year-end forecasts. They cited many of the same variables when weighing in on what they think bitcoin prices will do in 2017. In addition, they noted an influx of new money, rising interest rates and the way bitcoin has behaved in prior bull markets.

                            Not Just Bitcoin: The Top 7 Cryptocurrencies All Gained in 2016                        ",Frederick Reese,https://www.coindesk.com/not-just-bitcoin-the-top-7-cryptocurrencies-all-gained-in-2016/,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, CoinDesk contributor Frederick Reese gives an overview of trends in the digital currency and digital asset markets.   2016 has been an exciting year for cryptocurrencies. With most of the major open-source currencies showing growth this year and with some expected to see significant expansion in 2017, 2016 reflects a loss of faith in traditional money systems in light of the global populism trend and a growing confidence in the underlying technologies in play for crypto transactions. As the year comes to an end, CoinDesk took a moment to look at the best-performing cryptocurrencies by market capitalization for the year and the factors that affected the markets throughout the year. For the sake of this analysis, we are looking at a review period of December 27, 2015 to December 26, 2016. Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $6,161,215,794
Market Capitalization (End of Year): $14,590,356,108
Price (Beginning of Year): $411.99
Price (End of Year): $908.17
Price (Annual High): $909.94 In 2016, bitcoin remained the king of cryptocurrencies. The world's oldest blockchain-based asset proved to be a ""little engine that could,” booming dependably in times of macroeconomic uncertainty. While bitcoin failed to reach a new all-time high, the digital currency still rebounded from a low of under $400 to achieve an almost three-year high of $982.87 on 29th December. As of the writing of this article, the price was still at the upper end of the year's range, exceeding $950 per bitcoin. Though shallow markets could also be a factor, bitcoin prices and trading volume were supported by an extraordinary set of global circumstances (at least, according to analysts and investors). These included the devaluation of the Chinese yuan, the UK's decision to leave the EU, and the unpredictability of a Donald Trump presidency. Yet, despite this, bitcoin remained in the middle of the pack by metrics such as year-to-date valuation change and toward the bottom in terms change in market capitalization by percentage. However, bitcoin’s large valuation arguably makes its positive growth more significant to the global investment community. Still, most of the trading activity remains centered in Asia, as Chinese trading volume continued to exceeded US trading volume by significant multitudes. As seen above, some of the largest Chinese miners and exchanges – OKCoin, Huobi, BTCC, Bitfinex and LakeBTC – dominated global bitcoin trading this year. The drop in the yuan may be the reason for all this activity, however, with reports of the Chinese government exploring ways to resolve the obvious bypassing of its capital controls, the local scene may eventually become more subdued. Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $80,339,474
Market Capitalization (End of Year): $638,041,577
Price (Beginning of Year): $2.83
Price (End of Year): $7.31
Price (Annual High): $19.59 2016 saw ether – the cryptocurrency that powers the ethereum network – become one of the world's best-performing currencies, despite a well-publicized hack. With a more than 2,000% increase over the first six months of the year and a nearly 300% increase for the calendar year, the pioneering blockchain for decentralized applications suffered from high volatility, perhaps due to its relative newcomer status. The most significant factors in the instability of the ether price were the DAO hack, the subsequent collapse of the autonomous organization, and the creation of ethereum classic. These actions, occuring in June and July, saw an erosion of nearly 50% of the altcoin’s worth in less than two days. It's important to understand what affect the creation of ethereum classic had on ethereum (see above image). While valuation recovered to a certain degree, the successive forking of the blockchain led to a steady decline in prices. However, as ethereum is currently being seen as the preferred network for possible FinTech permissioned distributed ledgers, enterprise software and Internet of Things applications, 2017 could show a capitalization increase for ether. Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $206,189,522
Market Capitalization (End of Year): $231,713,026
Price (Beginning of Year): $0.006168
Price (End of Year): $0.006310
Price (Annual High): $0.009358 To begin with, it's important to recognize the clear the distinction between an open blockchain asset such as bitcoin, and one that operates on a permissioned ledger overseen by a private company, like Ripple's XRP token. Yet, seeing where this upstart lies on the cryptocurrency map helps to understand what happened in other markets this year. Serving as an intermediary for instantaneously converting one currency to another, there are no retailers that accept XRP. Despite this – and maybe because of the potential XRP has for regulated cross-border commerce – Ripple did show significant potential for growth and currently has the second highest market capitalization among publicly traded cryptocurrencies. Despite this, XRP ended this year close to its opening price, though it did see some noteworthy volatility along the way. The largest spike came in September following investments from major financial firms such as Standard Chartered and Siam Capital. Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $149,142,004
Market Capitalization (End of Year): $212,469,870
Price (Beginning of Year): $3.41
Price (End of Year): $4.34
Price (Annual High): $5.55 One of the oldest of the bitcoin alternatives, litecoin showed one of the more stable valuation curves for 2016. Closing more than $2 above its starting price for the year, litecoin showed gradual but steady growth in value. This was disturbed, however, by two events. In June, litecoin saw its upward spike – which was fueled by the recovery in valuation from the altcoin's 2015 reward halving and by the lowering of mining difficulty – grow significantly in response to the Brexit vote. This, as with bitcoin and most of the world’s fiat currencies, led to the strengthening of the US dollar’s value against the litecoin and caused a significant price drop. Then, in August, VC-backed startup Coinbase added litecoin to GDAX for dollar trading, which cause a temporary spike in pricing. Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $4,707,521
Market Capitalization (End of Year): $133,545,372
Price (Beginning of Year): $0.448294
Price (End of Year): $10.38
Price (Annual High): $13.50 As far as market capitalization growth as a percentage goes, monero is far and away alone in the pack. With a monetization that went from $4.7m at the beginning of our observation period to a high of nearly $168m, monero made skeptics of this non-bitcoin derivative eat their words and rethink their portfolios. The primary reason for monero's rapid valuation increase was its adoption as a preferred currency by the DarkNet market AlphaBay. While this brings up the ghosts of bitcoin's use in dark markets, the exposure served to help mainstream the formerly obscure altcoin. ""Alphabay Market is now implementing monero,"" reads a press release on Reddit. ""Following the demand from the community, and considering the security features of monero, we decided to add it to our marketplace."" This was followed by the currency’s adoption by Oasis Market, another DarkNet marketplace, and by extensive coverage by Vice, ZDNet and others. However, as monero pricing is subject to the same hype market that affects other cryptocurrencies, the price spike collapsed in the post-summer cool down, only to ratchet up again following news of Donald Trump’s election win. Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $47,874,732
Market Capitalization (End of Year): $90,639,072
Price (At Creation): $0.58
Price (End of Year): $1.05
Price (Annual High): $3.30 If XMR represented the highest percent of annual growth for 2016, classic ether represents the highest percentage of price loss for the year. The result of a hard fork to refund the out-of-pocket token holders of The DAO after the 18th June hack, ethereum classic (ETC) formed due to a split in the ethereum community in which some felt that ""code is law"", the blockchain is immutable and that any attempt to correct a “permitted” action defies the purpose and value of the blockchain. The controversial split created a high amount of enthusiasm amongst some traders, which saw classic ether’s prices climb well above $2 and 24-hour trade volume to over $133m at its highest. The 24-hour trade volume at the end of our observation period is less than $750,000, with a low of about $205,000 on 20th November, as per CoinMarketCap. The notion of a double blockchain has always been a troubling and something bitcoin has desperately sought to avoid, as having two competing, identical blockchain could possibly erode confidence in one or both. It would seem that this is exactly what happened with ethereum classic – as ethereum rose, ethereum classic sank. However, there is some light at the end of this tunnel: classic has made as much as a 37% comeback in December, due to aggressive trading by the Chinese altcoin community. With a spike in hashrate, it is likely that this uptick may be part of a long-term trend. Market Capitalization (Beginning of Year): $16,081.586
Market Capitalization (End of Year): $70,675,107
Price (Beginning of Year): $2.64
Price (End of Year): $9.67
Price (Annual High): $14.42 In 2015, darkcoin decided to end its association with shadow businesses and the DarkNet by changing its name to Dash. ""Recently it became apparent that our branding was getting in the way of our mission, so we started investigating rebranding,"" said Dash lead developer Evan Duffield to IBTimes at the time. ""We believe Dash, which stands for digital cash, is a great representation of what we want to become."" “That's the way that Bitcoin started and it eventually moved away from that and more into legitimate areas, so I'm guessing that [Dash] will go the same route.” This rebranding seemed to work. Dash ended its year with pricing nearly three times, and a market capitalization close to four times, where they started the year. Powered by its Darksend system, transactions are virtually untraceable on the Dash network, making Dash and its Masternodes' batch-processing of transactions a preferred choice for anonymity-seekers. It's important to note, however, that Dash still has its fair share of vocal detractors, so the verdict is still out on its potential. As we enter 2017, the future for the cryptocurrency market is looking bright. While some digital currencies, like bitcoin, may hit new highs, and others, like ethereum and ethereum classic, will fight for position, the digital currency/digital asset market will continue to progress and prove its worth as one of the top-performing commodities available today. At the same time, innovations in blockchain interactions, FinTech integration and anonymity-assurance will make cryptocurrencies in 2017 closer to the ideal imagined by Satoshi Nakamoto and the early pioneers of the technology. Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated the date darkcoin rebranding as Dash. Markets visualization via Shutterstock

                            Suspense Lingers as Bitcoin's Price Eyes $1,000                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/suspense-lingers-bitcoins-price-eyes-1000/,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 24th through 30th December.  Bitcoin prices pushed higher this week, benefiting from strong market sentiment, but ultimately failed to break through key resistance and reach $1,000. For those who weren't watching eagerly, the digital currency rose to a nearly three-year high of $982.87 on 29th December, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals, before declining to a press time value of $960. As noted in previous coverage, these figures represented signifcant gains, with the price rising almost $150 at points week over week. Still, the failure to surpass this level notably coincided with a glut of sell orders between $950 and $1,000 on exchanges Bitfinex, OKCoin and Bitstamp. ""It’s a classic resistance level,"" said Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM, pointing to the sell orders limiting bitcoin’s rally. Algorithmic trader Jacob Eliosoff also noted the difficulty of surpassing $1,000, given that psychological levels frequently have ""extra clusters"" of orders. While bitcoin prices have encountered resistance lately, the digital currency is still benefiting from a combination of robust demand and strong market sentiment. ""Bitcoin is on a tremendous bull run and, despite the pullbacks, that run is still very much in play,"" said Petar Zivkovski, COO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. A great deal of this, he said, is simply fear of missing out (FOMO), as many traders chase after quick profits. Zivkovski pointed out these developments at a time when market sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish, with Whaleclub data showing the market has been at least 90% long during every session between 24th and 29th December. He noted that traders ""refuse to let go of their long positions despite the relatively big swings and pullbacks"", adding: Yet, if the digital currency does breach this key psychological level, nobody knows where it will go next. Surpassing this price point could provoke a large number of sell orders, but it might also provide bitcoin prices with a new support level. Zivkovski stated that ""$1,000 and beyond is reachable in the near future,"" even if the digital currency experiences a pullback to the low $900s or even the $800s before doing so. Joe Lee, co-founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, emphasized the importance of this price level. ""$1,000 is a significant price point that traders from all jurisdictions will be observing,"" he told CoinDesk. But, while the price of bitcoin pushed higher this week, it was not the only digital currency to enjoy notable gains. Ether classic (ETC), the token that powers the smart contract-based platform ethereum classic, surged more than 50% this week, pushing higher as the network showed several signs of progress. ETC rose to as much as $1.63 on 30th December, its highest price since August, CoinMarketCap data reveals. This figure represents a roughly 55% increase from its opening price of $1.05. The digital currency rose to this four-month high as transaction volume picked up, with 24-hour trading volume totaling $8.2m on 29th December and repeatedly exceeding $10m on 30th December, additional CoinMarketCap figures show.  On the technical front, ethereum classic is looking forward to a protocol upgrade, named DieHard, which is scheduled to take place mid-January. This update will aim to give the network more time to implement upgrades by postponing the difficulty bomb, a feature programmed into both ethereum and ethereum classic to speed up the adoption of upgrades. The DieHard upgrade will also contain updates that make the ethereum classic network less vulnerable to spam attacks and also protect the network from replay attacks, which can happen if the ethereum network sends instructions to the ethereum classic network that were not originally designed for the latter. The ethereum classic community is also discussing what monetary policies to adopt as it begins to chart a course for the future. Should it differentiate from ethereum successfully, it could continue to remain an interesting asset to traders in 2017.

                            Will We See a $1,000 Bitcoin in 2016? Analysts Suggest Yes                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/will-bitcoin-surpass-1000-2016/," As 2016 draws to a close, bitcoin prices continue to show strong, upward movement. Depending on the media outlet you prefer, bitcoin is either ""storming"", ""surging"" or ""creeping"" its way back up to $1,000. In the past month alone, bitcoin has surged more than 33%, rising from $732 on 29th November to an annual high of $977.35. At press time, bitcoin was up nearly 5% for the day's trading, capping off a seven-day period in which it saw 20% gains. Should bitcoin prices breach $1,000 (the first time since January 2014), the digital currency could benefit from a handful of new tailwinds. The simple act of rising above $1,000, analysts say, is likely to generate greater visibility and therefore a flow of new money into bitcoin. Surpassing $1,000 could also make this price a new support level. Should bitcoin fall back after surpassing this point, the decline could motivate market participants to step in and buy the currency, thereby setting a price floor at $1,000. But bitcoin prices will reach $1,000 soon enough, according to cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Tim Enneking, who told CoinDesk he expects the digital currency will start out 2017 at this price. Enneking emphasized the importance of a ""Santa Claus Rally"" in 2016, meaning bitcoin's gains before and after Christmas. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of exchange firm BitMEX, provided an almost identical prediction ""I am calling for $1,000 to be breached by the 31st of December 2016. The price corrected to $860 and was back above $900 in one day. That is a very healthy pullback,"" he told CoinDesk, adding: In an opinion piece issued yesterday, investor Vinny Lingham suggested the same, stopping short of any year-end price predictions but issuing a rosy 2017 projection. ""I expect to be within the $3,000 range by the end of next year, as I have previously forecast,"" he wrote. Still, not everyone was convinced they could make a call. Cryptocurrency fund trader Jacob Eliosoff emphasized that he believes the bitcoin and ether markets are likely to correlate through the year's end. While he acknowledged bitcoin is likely to pass $1,000, he didn't rule out that another cryptocurrency could attract attention through stronger gains. In particular, he suggested a strong rise in long struggling ether prices, as an example, may be enough to move the market's attention elsewhere. Further, he emphasized that ""no one should bet too much on timed predictions"" when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Kid on trampoline image via Shutterstock

                            The Price of Bitcoin is Up $150 Over the Last Week                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/price-bitcoin-150-last-week/," The price of bitcoin keeps on climbing. At press time, the price of bitcoin was roughly $950 on the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index, a figure that was up $20 from the day's opening price and just $70 shy of a three-year high for the digital currency. (The price hit a high of $1,023.31 on 6th January, 2014). However, this total was notably $150 above the opening price observed one week ago on 21st December, when tokens running on the bitcoin blockchain traded for an average of $799.23 across global exchanges. The 20% increase over just a seven-day span has so far drawn a number of plausible theories, including that bitcoin is improving on economic conditions in countries such as India and Venezuela and decisions by the US Federal Reserve. Data reveals that the increase is the largest price swing observed since late July, when the price of bitcoin declined from highs in the $660s to the mid-$500s following a hack on one of the network's most notable exchanges. Yet, while notable for 2016, the rapid increase is by no means unique to the digital currency. In late 2013, for instance, bitcoin rose nearly $500 to more than $1,100 from 23rd November to 30th November, before falling below $700 just days later.

                            Bitcoin in 2017: A Currency Devaluation Hedge for Emerging Markets                        ",Vinny Lingham,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-2017-currency-devaluation-hedge-emerging-markets/,"Vinny Lingham is the CEO of identity startup Civic, and the former founder of mobile gift card platform Gyft. In this opinion piece, Lingham gives an overview of bitcoin's recent positive performance, predicting a $1,000 bitcoin before the year's end, and even a $3,000 bitcoin by 2018.  Since writing ""Bitcoin Awakening"" in April, bitcoin has moved from trading in the $400-dollar range to the verge of $1,000. This is the first time this has happened since 2013, as I had forecast in that blog post. But to be even clearer, I said that it would hit $15bn market cap this year, which I'm pleased to report officially happened today when the price breached $934. But before I break down my thoughts for 2017, I wanted to point out a couple of things. In total, the price of bitcoin spent less than 48 hours in the $800 zone, after trading sideways for weeks in the $700s.  Apart from the usual troll tweets responding to that tweet, I also received some flattering responses. As much as I enjoy the attention, and the emergence of nicknames such ""Bitcoin Oracle"" (Thanks to TwoBitIdiot for coining it!), I do feel the need to make a point of two things, in particular. Firstly, I don’t have a crystal ball, and everything I say has a certain percentage chance of either occurring or not occurring – we live in a probabilistic world, so when I make a call, it's because I think the outcome is highly likely, but that does not always mean it's certain. Secondly, I’m a macro guy , with a big picture focus. I don't look at the trading charts every day (I just don’t have the time!) and even though I don’t actively trade anymore, I do understand things like leverage, slippage and liquidity in markets quite well. I don't do technical analysis, as macro factors will shift the playing field and disrupt the charts, so in my opinion, they are often best used for looking back, and not forward. Most of my calls are based upon fundamentals that I observed from my working knowledge of capital flows, supply and demand and other fundamental perspectives on economics, psychology, money, business, game theory and a host of other subjects – including life experiences and the differences between living in South Africa and the US (capital controls, hyperinflation leading to Zimbabwe’s currency collapse, high interest rate environments, etc). If you have read my prior posts, you will find this to be the case when I lay out fundamentals for why I believe things in the bitcoin world will play out the way I forecast or suggest. This is not wizardry or crystal ball stuff, it’s just observations that I have made from analyzing lots of disparate data and information derived from multiple sources and then trying to figure it all out. And, sometimes I will be wrong. That said, I believe bitcoin has performed particularly well over the past month for two primary reasons. The first is largely due to the macro economic factors –  demonetization in places like India and Venezuela, geopolitical concerns over the Trump election and most importantly but most misunderstood, the recent Fed rate hike (which puts pressure on emerging market currencies, strengthens the dollar and creates a surge in the forex/BTC trading). In turn, this creates additional foreign buying and demand for bitcoin as a forex hedge, particularly outside the US. The second factor is that after the $800 price mark was breached, there was a hollow supply interval between $800–$900 (ie: there were not a lot of sellers, for various reasons which would take too long to explain in this post). This triggered an effective short squeeze and pushed the price above $900 very quickly. We will most likely find a potentially short period of consolidation around the low $900s, before we start testing the four-digit barrier, possibly with one or two mini spikes to the mid $900s and then a sell off back into the upper $800s/low $900s as the market finds its feet. There is also the year-end impact of profit taking around 31st December, but I don’t expect it to be outside these ranges. As I alluded to in the previous point, the Fed interest rates impact bitcoin to a degree that most people will not grasp. This is a topic for a much longer post, so I will need to be brief here. Essentially, the higher the rates go, the higher the demand for bitcoin will be. The divergence that you see is happening because gold has been heavily favored by gold bugs for historical reasons (in times of crises, etc) as the go-to commodity based store of value if an economic collapse happens. This was often followed by a period of low interest rates and then inflation. Inflation is just not happening in the US, due to quantitative easing. As a result, gold is still overvalued, especially if the Fed now continues to raise rates, which I expect will occur. Bitcoin will rise with an interest rate hike because unlike gold, there is further upside in the capital value of bitcoin, so the need for some type of yield to offset it is greatly reduced. When the Fed raises rates, emerging market economies have their currency devalued, which raises the effective price of bitcoin for people in those markets, creating more equity value in their bitcoins and driving up demand for more. This is because the price to mine a bitcoin is largely uniform (electricity price aside) in every country in the world, as it’s a commodity that trades freely across global markets  (labor input costs are not germane to bitcoin, unlike gold). If your currency devalues, it just costs you more to mine a bitcoin or buy a bitcoin. The market doesn’t care how your currency is performing. Some would argue that bitcoins don’t provide yield similar to gold and therefore should be subject to the same price pressures that impact the precious metal as interest rates rise. But, the reality is that the current market capitalization of bitcoin is fractional to gold and so, for the time being, the expected capital appreciation of bitcoin heavily discounts the need for a yield curve right now. This may change in the future. To expand on Fed monetary policy a bit more, the world has been on a dollar-based debt binge for assets and equity over the past eight years, with record low interest rates, which partially explains the negative interest rate policy (NIRP) in some countries (watch RealVisionTV.com for more detailed info here). When rates rise, entities (corporates or governments) have to then make interest rate payments in USD and, to do that, they then have to sell local currency. This in turn further weakens the local currencies – effectively trying to close out a dollar short position on a regular basis. This is over and above any unwinding of carry trade positions that are no longer profitable with higher cost dollars, and so a vicious cycle ensues. Bottom line is that rate hikes devalue foreign currencies and strengthen the dollar. This is particularly visible in countries where entities with local currency earnings have been financing dollar-denominated debts without sufficient dollar-based income. Bitcoin is seen to be gaining in local currency price trading pairs, which makes it far more desirable and in effect increases demand, because of upward price momentum in those currencies which creates more demand for bitcoin. Without a doubt, bitcoin will rise further next year – I expect to be within the $3,000 range by the end of next year, as I have previously forecast. Overall, I would compare the last price spike in 2013 to $1,255 as being ""irrational exuberance,"" similar to the peak of the dot.com bubble – so I don't expect another one like this again, but I could be wrong. Similarly, the tech world eventually crushed those ""bubble"" highs once the technology and businesses matured and built towards higher and even more sustainable highs, post 2000. Since the previous high for bitcoin, it has been over three years. A lot has changed since then, and I will write a follow-up post which expands on some of the topics above in greater detail, but for now, I will summarize my expectations for next year. Looking ahead, we can expect reasonably low volatility for bitcoin (maybe a couple of dips here and there), a steady pace of growth, broader industry use cases and applications for bitcoin, and the adoption of Segregated Witness (SegWit) to handle scaling. My company, Civic, is building out a blockchain-based identity platform and I’m very excited about the prospects of using a public ledger for global identity management (and no, we don’t store your personal info on the blockchain!). Also likely is the government sponsorship or endorsement of bitcoin-related companies and more likely, government-led buying of bitcoins or investment into bitcoin mining companies or similar. Potential government crackdowns on bitcoin in certain countries, due to capital flight or loss of exchange controls could be seen as well. But, this will drive up the bitcoin price in the black markets in those economies. I do expect a two-to-three-times price growth overall in 2017 for the USD/BTC pair. This may result in bitcoin prices in other currencies being up 4x to 7x, but I think it’s fair to say that USD/BTC pairing is what we should use as the benchmark. While these are all exciting developments, there are some events that are unlikely to occur. Parabolic growth (20x gains) are unlikely, ie: bitcoin at $10,000 is probably not going to happen in 2017. A hard fork is also not realistic, given what happened with ethereum (I would give this a 5% chance of happening). Consumer adoption  will still trail, and I don’t believe we’re going to see mass adoption of bitcoin as a currency of any sort by average consumers. I would still argue that bitcoin is a commodity today, not a currency. That will change in time.

                            Ensuring Bitcoin Fungibility in 2017 (And Beyond)                        ",David Vorick,https://www.coindesk.com/ensuring-bitcoin-fungibility-in-2017-and-beyond/,"David Vorick is a Bitcoin Core developer, former IBM software developer and the co-founder of decentralized cloud storage platform Sia.  In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Vorick tells us why ensuring fungibility remains a top priority for bitcoin developers entering 2017, and how 2016 increased awareness of what he argues is a pivotal issue.   Fungibility, put simply, is the idea that every item in a set is worth exactly the same amount. In bitcoin, fungibility means that all bitcoins have the same value, regardless of who owns them or what their history is – and fungibility is extremely important to the success of a decentralized network. To understand why, we have to analyze how bitcoin's current limited fungibility is creating real problems in the marketplace. For example, it's common for exchanges and merchants to discriminate between bitcoins based on the owner or their history. An example is that exchanges will attempt to block bitcoins that have been stolen, especially if the theft was well publicized. Other points of discrimination can extend to include bitcoins associated with drugs, gambling and other societal vices. But it's important to note, this can happen even in cases where the owner of those bitcoins hasn't engaged in any such behavior. In short, the problem can be summed up like this: bitcoins with clean history can be accepted everywhere, while coins with dirty history can only be accepted in places that aren't performing strict background checks. The problem is not that the merchants are rejecting bitcoins associated with unfavorable activities, the problem is the effect that it has on everyone else. When performing a trade, dirty bitcoins are less valuable than clean coins. That means that everyone needs to know when they make a trade whether the bitcoins they will be receiving are dirty or clean, because that impacts whether they are getting a fair trade and whether they will be able to spend them or cash them out through the typical avenues. The only way to know that your bitcoins are clean is to go to a centralized service and ask for a background check. Suddenly the value of your coins is being decided by a centralized party (something that many would argue runs directly against the core values of the bitcoin project). Every platform accepting bitcoin could implement different policies for deciding which coins are clean or dirty. And exchanges in different legal jurisdictions (US, China, India, etc) are likely to have different policies. The bitcoins worth the most money would then be the bitcoins accepted everywhere (which would only be a small subset of available bitcoins). This means it's not enough to just ask one exchange for a background check, you have to ask every major platform whether or not they think you have clean coins. And a platform doesn't think that you have clean coins, their decision reduces the value of your holdings regardless of whether you actually use that platform – your coins cannot be traded with any of the platform's users. 2016 has increasingly seen bitcoin fungibility come under attack. Blockchain forensics startup Elliptic was able to raise $5m for the purposes of identifying illicit bitcoins, while exchanges like Coinbase have become increasingly strict about accepting coins with known fringe histories. So fungibility has been damaged, though not yet enough that people feel like they need to consult blacklist services before accepting bitcoins. That day is getting closer, though, and when it arrives it will be a massive blow to the whole bitcoin ecosystem – the need to consult a blacklist service is the need to ask permission to use bitcoin. It will mean that bitcoin has become centralized. Because any platform in any jurisdiction can damage fungibility by choosing to discriminate between coins, most fungibility improvements come down to privacy. The best way to protect fungibility is to ensure that there's no way to tell the difference between two coins, regardless of the actual history of those coins. 2016 has seen a lot of momentum in this direction, with many of the improvements on track to become available to the general public in 2017. Below is a list of the most exciting things happening with regards to fungibility. Most transactions today in bitcoin go onto the permanent public ledger, available for anyone to scrutinize. Lightning changes this equation by allowing strangers who have never met to transact without ever making a transaction on the ledger – instead doing everything off-chain through the Lightning Network. The number of open-source Lightning implementations increased substantially in 2016, with the total number now somewhere between five and 10. This list includes implementations from Lightning, Blockstream and MIT. Though no solution is yet ready for the masses, there has been major progress, and several implementations are promising basic releases in 2017. Most of the existing code depends on Segregated Witness (SegWit) activation, however. Provided SegWit succeeds, 2017 should be the year that you are able to try out bitcoin's Lightning Network for yourself. A research paper for a new tumbling service was released in early 2016, TumbleBit is unlike existing tumbling services. This was a big leap forward, as it provided tumbling service that could not scam its users, and also could not de-anonymize its users. In short, a major improvement to existing tumbling strategies. More than just a paper, successful tumbling operations have been submitted over the live bitcoin network. TumbleBit is not something that you can use today, however, but a command line release is expected in early 2017 and a user-friendly graphical release is expected mid year. You can expect 2017 to be the first year where bitcoin can fully support large scale, anonymous, secure tumbling operations, and that's exciting. Long awaited, October 2016 finally saw the release of Zcash, a cryptocurrency in pursuit of the holy grail of fungibility. zkSnarks, the technology behind Zcash, make it possible to achieve true fungibility, where every single coin looks identical to every other coin. The issue is that only recent computers are powerful enough to perform Zcash transactions, and there is uncertainty that the cryptography will hold up against further scrutiny. Still, 2017 is likely to see improved performance, reduced computational requirements, and quite possibly improvements to the cryptographic protocols. The progress that Zcash has made so far is a huge benefit to the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Monero is a cryptocurrency with a core focus of fungibility, and its greatest strength is perhaps its philosophy, which holds that fungibility is strongest when everybody is forced to use private transactions. Monero essentially acts as a giant on-chain coin mixer, with every single transaction participating in the mixing. This has a huge advantage over traditional mixers, as people tend to only mix their coins when they have something to hide (meaning that it's often reasonable to assume that coins are dirty merely because they've been mixed). With Monero, that assumption is invalid, because all transactions contain mixed coins. Due to this philosophy, and due to the large number of users, Monero is perhaps the most fungibile cryptocurrency in the ecosystem, outperforming even Zcash by this attribute. 2016 saw a huge rise in popularity for Monero (placing it as the most valuable privacy-focused cryptocurrency), and saw the creation of a new protocol, RingCT, which combines Monero's traditional output mixing with the ability to disguise the value of the coins being spent. A hard fork in early 2017 will introduce RingCT into Monero, further enhancing the privacy and fungibility of the cryptocurrency. Elsewhere, 2016 has seen massive progress in the direction of privacy and fungibility. JoinMarket, which has been under active development by multiple developers throughout 2016, is working to provide a decentralized tumbling service. Further, 2016 saw the introduction of the MimbleWimble protocol, which would allow historic transactions to be removed entirely from the blockchain. Progress was also made on privacy-improving technologies like MAST and Schnorr signature aggregation. It's believed Schnorr signature aggregation will allow multiparty signatures to appear like single-party signatures, while MAST will allow highly complicated scripts to appear like less-complicated scripts. Client-side validation is an off-chain scaling technique which improves both privacy and scalability, allowing both the blockchain history and the blockchain state to be pruned, exposing tiny pieces only to those who need to see them. Each of these improvements is good for fungibility, and each is being actively researched or developed. With this in mind, it's safe to say that fungibility research is very active today, and is likely to produce exciting new technologies in 2017. Rubber ducks image via Shutterstock

                            How Not to Lose Your Bitcoin in 2017                        ",Pamela Morgan,https://www.coindesk.com/how-not-to-lose-your-bitcoin-in-2017/,"Pamela Morgan is an entrepreneur, attorney, educator and CEO of Third Key Solutions, a key consulting and management company that is the culmination of her work advising bitcoin startups on security and estate planning.  2017 is almost here and the bitcoin price is surging! Are you surprised by how much your bitcoin is worth? Don't let that surprise turn to dismay by losing it. Now is the perfect time to take a few basic precautions to keep your cryptocurrency secure. Here are 8 do-it-yourself tips to help you improve your security: You can never say it enough: back up your wallet. If you haven’t yet backed up your wallet, do it now. Most hardware and software wallets use an industry standard backup protocol called BIP 39 that allows your wallet backup to be 12, 18, or 24 English words. It's important to write the words down, on paper, in order, and securely store the backup somewhere safe from people, water and fire. If you don’t back up your wallet, you could well lose your bitcoin. Forever. If you have backed up your wallet, check on the backup locations. The new year is a perfect time to check on your important papers, including your wallet backups. Can you still access them? Can you still read the words? Are they secure from fire, water and theft? If you've given the backups to someone else (lawyer, accountant), ask them to check their storage. Do they still have them? Verify the location and security of your backups. While we all know we should be checking our backups, wallets and estate plans regularly, it's hard to remember to do it. Add a reminder to your calendar now, to check all these things again in three, six or at most 12 months. With the increase in the bitcoin price, you might be shocked at how much money you've been carrying around on your smartphone. Now is a great time to move your coins onto a hardware wallet or into cold storage. Hardware wallets are very easy to use, with user-friendly software components, and are considered one of the safest ways to store bitcoin. While it's great to carry petty cash or spending money on your phone, never carry more bitcoin on your smartphone than you would carry as cash in your wallet. If you have coins sitting on an exchange, move them out today to a wallet you control. Most of the popular exchanges pool coins and while you have a ""balance"" showing on your account, you do not actually control the keys. If the exchange gets hacked you could lose your money. Remember that you only control the bitcoin if you control the keys: ""not your keys, not your bitcoin"". Add two-factor authentication to your bitcoin-related accounts and to all other important online accounts. The best two-factor solution is a hardware token and you can buy one for just $20–$30. Otherwise use a smartphone authentication app, such as Authy or Google Authenticator. SMS is not a very good two-factor solution, though it is still better than none at all. Humans are great at identifying patterns and that makes us terrible at randomness. Password best practices – choose a different random password for each site, never write them down – pose management problems. For most people, the only way to accomplish this is to use a password manager – one which generates and stores your passwords securely on multiple devices. Popular managers include 1Password, LastPass, and the open source KeePass. Many offer free basic services, with premium services costing less than $80 per year. They're easy to use and in just a couple of weeks you’ll never want to be without one again. If something happened to you tomorrow would your family be able to access your bitcoin? While this tip takes time to implement, it's worth it. It shouldn’t take you more than an hour to make a plan and decide who you want to get what, write down instructions and tell your family about your plan. Be sure to consult an attorney, to make sure your plan is consistent with local law and can’t be challenged in a court. If you have a will, trust, or other estate plan, let your attorney know that you have new assets that need to be included in your plan. Getting your first bitcoin is becoming easier and easier, but keeping it safe from hackers, insolvent exchanges, and loss isn't as easy. These 8 tips will help you bring in the new year with a renewed sense of confidence that you can safeguard the bitcoin that you have, especially now that it’s worth a lot more.

                            Trusted Hardware Can Help Bitcoin Scale, But At What Cost?                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/trusted-hardware-can-help-bitcoin-scale-cost/," As 2016 comes to a close, bitcoin development remains at a crossroads. Take the long-anticipated scaling solution, the Lightning Network. An open-source project that aims to boost bitcoin's capacity to millions of transactions per second (and by extension the technology's value), it's code is nearly ready to go live. Yet, bitcoin isn't exactly ready for the change. While some form of the Lightning Network is possible to deploy today, the technical change that could pave the way for an improved version still needs near-unanimous support from miners and users or it won’t activate. (For now, miner hashrate signaling has plateaued at about 25%, far from the necessary 95%). This bottleneck has lead some researchers to begin exploring other options for getting Lightning-style payment channels off the ground. One new idea, Teechan, comes from Initiative For CryptoCurrencies & Contracts (IC3), an academic group focused on blockchain and led by Cornell University. The announcement post explains that the off-chain transaction protocol is similar to Lightning Network, potentially allowing millions of transactions per second – but it uses a different construction. Namely, it relies on a special type of hardware, Intel SGX, that masks data and guards it from outside tinkering. The upside is that it works right now, and that it takes advantage of the relative ubiquity of Intel's chips. Ittay Eyal, one of the computer scientists behind Teechan, told CoinDesk: One thing to keep in mind, however, is that participants would need to buy a specific type of computer with a specific hardware to open up a channel. (Intel SGX only works on a subset of the company's products). While bitcoin's developers say they aren't opposed to the idea of trusted hardware in all blockchain networks, the idea it could be applied to a global, trustless network in some capacity has some up in arms. At issue for many is that trusted hardware is at odds with bitcoin's decentralized security model as it has been popularly conceived. By nature, it requires some degree of trust in the tech giant Intel. The use of trusted hardware in cryptocurrency projects (that are largely software driven) has drawn skepticism before for that reason. Although trusted execution environments are one way to ensure the privacy and security of data, Intel (or another hardware provider) potentially has a backdoor to the content. ""That’s certainly true,"" said Cornell Tech computer science professor Ari Juels, though he argued that it’s ""hard to escape"" centralization in all forms. Trust in Intel is particularly hard to avoid, he said, since their chips power so many devices, even the nodes and wallets that bitcoiners already rely on. According to data from 2015, nearly 90% of all computers run on Intel chips. There seems to be some interest in the idea from other open-source blockchain communities as well. Ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin, for instance, posted a Twitter poll last week asking his followers how they feel about the trend towards using trusted hardware as an ""ingredient"" in blockchain projects, which received a mixed response. The answer might not be so clear, according to cryptographer Matthew Green. ""It depends what's at stake. The security of a global network and billions of dollars? No way,"" he commented, reiterating how he believes Intel poses a single point of failure. Here Green might be referencing proof-of-elapsed-time (PoET), a consensus algorithm developed by Intel that uses the same Intel hardware. With that in mind, IC3 has been looking into trusted computing use cases beyond micropayment channels. (Intel was even recently added as a sponsor of the academic blockchain group). Further, of 13 blockchain projects listed on the IC3 website, at least three use trusted computing to some degree as a way to ensure data integrity or privacy. One reason is that the smart contracts that would run on top of a blockchain are increasingly being thought of as tools for data verification, say, if the temperature on a certain date and time would be necessary for its execution. ""Pretty much any interesting smart contract needs to have some awareness of real-world state. Any financial instrument needs to have an idea of what’s going on in the real world, whether equity prices, commodity prices,"" Juels said. But, while it might sound like an easy task, retrieving trustworthy data for smart contracts is what Juels called it a ""pretty major stumbling block,"" because data can be manipulated before it reaches the smart contract. He argued that current oracles on ethereum don't provide high trust assurance. On the other hand, the project Town Crier uses SGX to scrape data from a website that the participants deem trustworthy with the assurance that it won’t be tampered with in its journey to the smart contract. The Town Crier white paper is public, and IC3 plans to release a public version on ethereum in early 2017. Hawk is another ethereum project that uses the privacy technology behind Zcash to hide the sending and receiving addresses of ethereum transactions. Programmers can write smart contracts as they normally would, then, run it through the Hawk compiler to mask its contents. By playing the role of “manager” in some Hawk applications, Intel SGX can help to execute Hawk smart contracts that sees a user’s inputs, but is trusted to keep them secret from other programs. And this may be just the beginning. Juels thinks there are many future applications of trusted hardware that have yet to be tapped and many more experiments for developers to attempt. As an example, he cited how bug bounties now offer rewards to coders, benefiting open-source projects (such as ethereum) as well as coders who have the ability to spot errors. But, Juels mentioned that fair exchange is often an issue. Coders don't always get paid what they're promised after revealing the bug that they found, while others might get a pay out for finding a bug that isn't real or useful. He offered the idea of a bug bounty smart contract. Using the strong integrity guarantees of SGX, bounty hunters can prove that they discovered a bug without revealing it to the company. In the future, IC3 is also looking into improving concepts that are already out there, and continue the development of protocols that use trusted hardware. While the jury may still be out on the technology, it's safe to say it could become a big trend in the year ahead as major blockchains compete to boost capacity. Tools image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Prices Rally Nearly 18% As 2016 Draws to a Close                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-prices-18-percent-2016/,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 17th through 23rd December.  Bitcoin prices surged more than 17% during the week through 23rd December. The digital currency surpassed $900 after opening the week at $780.85, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal. At press time, bitcoin prices had climbed as much as $918.95 during the session – a 17.7% gain since the start of the week. Markets are currently trading at an average of $916.19. Bitcoin experienced these gains amid several contributing factors, including strong market sentiment and significant trade volume on Chinese exchanges. In sum, the price gains signify a strong rally after markets pushed through key resistance at $800. Aside from that, market observers have pointed to several developments – India’s push to remove certain notes from circulation and sociopolitical turmoil in Europe in particular – as potential drivers of further activity in bitcoin markets. Market observers struck a bullish tone about the price movements taking place over the last few days. “Sentiment is overwhelmingly bullish,” said Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. Whaleclub data indicates that the market was 94% long on average in the seven days through 23rd December, after being 90% long on average during the week prior. According to Zivkovski, traders have kept these positions open for shorter periods on average. These factors indicate that traders are “after a quick profit since the trend is so bullish,” he said. While bitcoin prices did see significant gains during the week, they lingered below $800 for the better part of the seven-day period, breaking through this key level on Tuesday, 20th December, BPI figures reveal. Bitcoin markets did see some resistance at $800, a development noted by market analyst Jacob Eliosoff. After the price broke through this level, it rose far more quickly. “It sure looked like steady buying took several days to grind through all the sell orders around $800, and, once it got past them, moved much more quickly through thinner offers above $800,” said Eliosoff, a cryptocurrency fund trader. Bitcoin prices rose quickly, climbing to as much as $874.10 on 22nd December. The digital currency saw another sharp price gain the following day, surpassing $900. Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency hedge fund EAM, argued that bitcoin could easily push higher, saying that it has broken free of rangebound trading. “We’ve broken out of a two-year trading range, so we’re going to move much higher, I think,"" he said. ""We may hit my $1,200 much earlier than I thought.” While Enneking and Zivkovski both emphasized the important role that market dynamics played in driving bitcoin prices this week, Eliosoff cited something else entirely – China. Market observers often point to China as playing a crucial role in bitcoin’s price movements, and this week was no exception. Trading activity on the nation’s exchanges was a major driver of this week’s rally in bitcoin prices, said Eliosoff, who runs a cryptocurrency fund. He noted that these transactions could have been caused by a number of factors. “The question is always how much of the Chinese buying is a) capital control evasion, b) just reducing [yuan] exposure, but not necessarily moving wealth outside China or c) sheer speculation/gambling,"" he said. Eliosoff emphasized that while nobody knows for certain, his guess would be that the biggest causal factor driving this week’s bitcoin price gains was traders reducing their exposure to the yuan. “The yuan has continued its slow depreciation, though not noticeably in the last 24 hours,"" he added. Regardless of which factors are driving bitcoin’s price movements in the near-term, these fluctuations ultimately come down to supply and demand, Enneking noted. “There are fewer [bitcoins] being created and interest is growing,"" he said. ""The price can only go one way.” This article is not intended to provide, and should not be taken as, investment advice. Image via Shutterstock

Bitcoin prices surged more than 80% over the course of the year, with these gains resulting from a handful of sharp price fluctuations combined with a general, upward trend. Bitcoin prices have risen from roughly $430 at the beginning of the year to around $790 at press time. These price gyrations took place as markets and those trading within them responded to a series of major global developments, including the decision by UK voters to exit the European Union, the hack of bitcoin exchange Bitfinex, and the halving of bitcoin’s mining reward, which reduced the number of new bitcoins produced in each transaction block from 25 BTC to 12.5 BTC. While bitcoin prices rose steadily in the months leading up to the halving, markets experienced more abrupt changes in response to Brexit and the Bitfinex hack. As a result, the cryptocurrency's 30-day BTC/USD volatility fluctuated quite a bit in 2016, falling below 1% in both April and October and then surging above 5% in July, according to data from The Bitcoin Volatility Index. It was the vote that stunned Europe. As reported at the time, 52% of UK voters opted to leave the European Union, an outcome that shocked pollsters and set the economic bloc on an uncertain path ahead. Bitcoin's price surged leading up to the Brexit vote, climbing roughly 47% between 1st and 18th June, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures show. Momentum drove the digital currency's price, pushing it above $780 to a 28-month high on 18th June.  However, bitcoin prices went on to lose some of these gains, plunging more than 10% on 21st June after a poll conducted by market research firm Survation showed 45% of voters wanted the UK to remain in the EU, compared to 42% who wanted to stick with the economic bloc. Bitcoin prices extended these losses on 23rd June, falling 15% to $551 early in the session as sources pointed to greater odds that the UK would stay in the EU. Against the predictions of many, the Brexit effort prevailed, and bitcoin prices opened 24th June at $625.49. Several analysts, including Joe Lee, founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, emphasized bitcoin’s role as a safe-haven asset to explain the significant volatility the cryptocurrency experienced before and after the Brexit referendum. “Bitcoin is an uncorrelated asset class and a valuable hedging mechanism,"" Lee told CoinDesk. ""In an investor portfolio where there is macroeconomic uncertainty fueled by local politics, diversifying outside of the geographical boundary becomes imperative."" The halving, on the other hand, was a more muted affair. Bitcoin's underlying code includes several scheduled reward reductions, causing the amount of new bitcoins produced with each block to decline over time. The halving on 9th July was preceded by speculation that the event would drive the price of bitcoin to new heights.  The digital currency's price fluctuated in early July, rising to as much as $704.42 on the 3rd of that month and then closing at $664.74 on the 8th, the day before the halving. Once this much-anticipated event took place, bitcoin prices traded largely within a reasonably tight range between $625 and $675, additional BPI figures show. Petar Zivkovski, COO for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, commented on how this event affected market participants. “Yes, the halving was probably the most impactful event this year. In the months leading up to the halving, price surged as traders and new money anticipated a decrease in supply production,"" he said. ""The mere idea of more scarcity was enough to pump price to newer highs.” However, not everyone seemed as convinced about the impact that the halving had on traders. Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged trading platform BitMEX, seemed a bit skeptical about the event’s importance. “Prices roughly doubled from January to July when the halving occurred,"" he told CoinDesk. Bitcoin prices did enjoy some notable gains during the first half of 2016, rising upwards of 20% in February and May and surging 26.5% in June, BPI figures reveal. These monthly increases contributed to the cryptocurrency spiking more than 56% gain during the first six months of the year, causing bitcoin to rise from roughly $430 to $672.48 in that time. Hayes commented on this relative calm, telling CoinDesk: No 2016 report on bitcoin’s price developments would be complete without covering the 2nd August hack of Bitfinex, which resulted in the loss of nearly 120,000 BTC. In the wake of the hack, the exchange temporarily stopped trading after the security breach was confirmed. Bitcoin prices cratered in response, declining roughly 20% during the session from $607.37 to $480.  Over the next few days, the digital currency recovered, reaching $580 on 4th August. Markets observers were split on the long-term impact of the Bitfinex hack, arguably the most impactful of 2016. “The hack killed the positive momentum building in bitcoin,” said Hayes. “It renewed doubts as to the viability of startups handling vast sums of client money. It also made many newcomers think twice before sending fiat or bitcoin to any exchange. He went on to say: However, others downplayed the importance of the incident. “The Bitfinex hack was a pseudo-event in that it managed to shake out weak hands while smart money swooped in to take advantage of the fear and uncertainty,” said Zivkovski. Bitfinex is a “small player,” he went on to assert, adding that this event was “very unlikely to change the course of bitcoin's underlying value”. After the dust of the Bitfinex hack settled, bitcoin prices enjoyed a steady, upward climb, rising from roughly $580 in early August to linger near $790 at the time of report, representing a 36% increase overall. During that time, controversial business tycoon Donald Trump won the 8th November presidential election, defeating former US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.  The price had experienced swings in the days leading up to the US vote. The price had gone as high as $744.28 on 3rd November, according to BPI data, only to tumble below the $680 mark later that day. In the aftermath of the win, bitcoin prices popped amid a broad decline in stock markets worldwide. Bitcoin prices rose more than 4% on 9th November, climbing from $709 to as much as roughly $739. While Trump’s victory was a shock to some, the resulting bitcoin price rally was not surprising to some observers. Following this event, the price of bitcoin fell back before continuing its slow, upward trajectory, leading them to the price of roughly $790 at press time. Image via Shutterstock

                            Will Bitcoin's Resurgence Bring the Banks on Board?                        ",Noelle Acheson,https://www.coindesk.com/will-bitcoins-resurgence-bring-the-banks-on-board/,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  Two unrelated news items this week could, when looked at together, point to where bitcoin development is heading. The first is that bitcoin’s price breached its previous annual high on relatively strong volume, and more or less held its position. The digital currency has managed to recover not only from the Bitfinex hack earlier this year, but also from the Mt Gox debacle in 2013. This sends a clear message of resilience. The support shows that governance and scalability problems are not enough to make a significant dent in interest in the cryptocurrency. And the relatively narrow trading band must reassure skeptics concerned about volatility. With this performance, bitcoin is taking steps towards dispelling financial institutions’ fears that it is an unsuitable blockchain. While work will no doubt continue on private blockchains (as it should), this is likely to lead to an increase in banks’ interest in public blockchains over the next few months. The second item is that bitcoin wallet startup Blockchain has signed ex-Barclays CEO Antony Jenkins to its board. As far as I know, this is the first time a previous chief of a big bank has joined a bitcoin-related startup. Is it a sign of bankers starting to engage with bitcoin? Or are bitcoin startups becoming interested in banks, the very entities the currency was created to circumvent? Let’s face it, bitcoin wallet providers are already similar to banks. Most of us choose to leave our holdings in accounts at exchanges or with services like Blockchain, knowing that they are not the most secure or decentralized option. Why? For convenience, just as we choose to keep our fiat money in a bank account rather than in wads of cash under mattresses. But banks are not like bitcoin wallet providers. They are not simple custodians or app builders. They are complex financial networks, powered by a wide array of users with different needs and priorities. There you have it. That is what wallet companies such as Blockchain most likely want to be: complex institutions with a range of services that will not only bring resilience to the business model, but will also be instrumental in pushing bitcoin closer towards mainstream use. Relationships between bitcoin startups and bankers will set both on a steep learning curve that will most likely end in a transformation of each. So here are my predictions for bitcoin in 2017: 1) Banks will be less afraid of associating with the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin has proven itself to be not nearly as volatile and fragile as they anticipated. They will be more open to collaborations, willing to test bitcoin-related functions and eager to engage with the community. Private blockchains will earn their place in the banking structure. But the scope and security of the public bitcoin network will open up easy connectivity and new use cases, provide a relatively low-cost sandbox for testing new applications and help existing institutions adapt to new environments. 2) Major cryptocurrency wallet businesses will focus on developing more complex services in order to appeal to a wider base of users and to offer an increasingly attractive alternative to fiat banking. In some cases, they will do this by leveraging relationships with fiat banks. In others, they will embellish the custodian services already on offer, joining forces with other startups to reinforce innovation. Who the main players will end up being, I don’t know. But I am certain that the end of 2016 will come to be seen as a tipping point, the moment when the bitcoin and fiat banking worlds began to think about how to collaborate instead of compete.

                            2017: The Second Era of Bitcoin Begins                        ",Akin Fernandez,https://www.coindesk.com/2017-second-era-bitcoin-begins/,"Akin Fernandez, also known as Beautyon, is the owner of London-based bitcoin voucher service Azteco. He is also a writer who has extensively covered bitcoin and related services, and a software developer with 15 years of experience. In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, Fernandez gives a passionate and personal overview of the cryptocurrency industry's year – 12 months that he says prove ""there can be only one bitcoin"". 2016 has been a fascinating year, where cellular mitosis has been bitcoin's guiding model. The different camps previously in one group or cell have split. There are those who understand bitcoin and remain in its cell, and those that do not, and who are now in their own offshoot cells, “experimenting” on branches that are essentially non-viable. The market participants who know how everything works, those in bitcoin, understand that there can only be one bitcoin. There has been some excellent analysis making this crystal clear, and the fundamentally transformative work being done to extend bitcoin is categorical proof that this is true. Bitcoin is the market winner because it is the first mover and definitive transaction layer. It is immutable not only in terms of the software rules, but the single minded, rational ethos of its protectors, who will not allow any corruption, hysteria or short-term thinking to spoil or endanger the project. Segregated Witness solves the transaction malleability problem, but more important than that, it makes all arguments about bitcoin’s transaction capacity limits a thing of the past. When SegWit activates, transactions using it will show up as spendable instantly – and there will be vastly more of them per second – killing another frequent and frankly, silly objection to bitcoin’s utility. You can get a glimpse of what this will look and feel like with this beautiful colored coins demonstration of Lighting. How bitcoin is used is about to change radically, and for the better. The final perceived limitations to it have been destroyed with SegWit. Now all that is left is building the software and businesses that will take advantage of this new, high-capacity bitcoin. Spectators learned again this year that bitcoin is the only solution, and the roll out of SegWit is further proof of this, and it will cement bitcoin’s premier position. A small group of malcontents will always be attached to any software project, and if the history of software is anything to go by, these miscreants will eventually fade away because they have no software or solutions to offer. If they don’t fade away and manage to scupper progress, then bitcoin was always doomed, and they deserve to win. All of the companies working from versions of the bitcoin software that is now two years old have forked off onto a path that doesn't have the incredible genius of Bitcoin Core underpinning their software. This year, they've struggled to find a use case for their software forks, have failed to attract developers to their GitHub repos and are still trumpeting secret “trials” with corporate sponsors which are nothing more than PR fluff. These sponsors will eventually tire of funding insurgents who don’t have the skill to add fundamental game changing features to the bitcoin software they downloaded, and the first market participant working with SegWit-enabled bitcoin, clearly demonstrating what it does, will cause the hapless sponsor firms to pivot away from these worthless trials and the Snake Oil companies in them. After claiming that bitcoin was ""dead"", R3 has managed to produce literally nothing. Incredibly, they asked their members what they want to see in a new platform, rather than innovating to provide one. Part of their plan (which is now under way with their Corda repo) is to tap the mystical “Open Source Energy” where software magically comes from. None of these people, the bitcoin forkers or R3CEV, understand what they are dealing with both in terms of what bitcoin is and what it is for; why regulation can’t be built in to any software project whose aim is to replace bitcoin; or software development in general and how that process works. They have all been “Trumped”. During the writing of this round up, there have been several interesting announcements. Goldman Sachs has left the R3 Blockchain Consortium, indicating once again that they have literally nothing of value to offer. I have no doubt that they are the first of many to abandon that ship without an engine, and you can be sure that this Emperor’s New Clothes affair is doomed to end up in Davy Jones’ repository. Circle has dropped support for bitcoin payments. The grown ups are tired of bitcoin. But wait, the ex-CEO of Barclays has joined the board of Blockchain! One wallet maker drops bitcoin, and the ex-head of one of the world’s biggest banks joins the biggest bitcoin wallet. Is bitcoin dying, or is it the next big thing? These people can’t decide! Coinbase, the company desperately trying to find out what it wants to be, adopted ethereum just before it was mortally wounded by the DAO disaster. More on that below, but more importantly, they have just been served by the US government with a “John Doe” request for their users' information. This is an absolute disaster for them. Defending this attack will cost them millions of dollars in legal fees and may take years to resolve. During this time of uncertainty, no one in bitcoin will trust them, drying up their already slow user adoption. The one good thing to come out of this is that the case against giving your details over to companies like Coinbase and Circle is now set in stone. Handing over your identity to a bitcoin company is not only worthless to you as a consumer, but it's very dangerous, and should always be avoided without exception. Here’s why: even if their users have done nothing wrong, Coinbase is now set to be compelled to reveal their names, addresses, bank details and their bitcoin addresses and transaction records, and you can be sure these users will be brutally audited by the IRS. So, regardless of whether they have done anything wrong and have paid all “their taxes”, they will now – at their own cost – have to prove their innocence (guilty before proven innocent; a complete violation of the US Constitution and Anglo-Saxon legal principles). This attack on Coinbase demonstrates why ethical bitcoin companies have railed against KYC/AML. It also shows by inference that bitcoin is anonymous enough to thwart the State, and they can only go after users if those users voluntarily attach their identities to bitcoin addresses controlled by companies in toxic jurisdictions. They can’t be easily identified in absentia of that voluntary self incrimination. If this were not the case, the IRS would go directly to the users without referring to Coinbase at all. The fact that they can’t shows bitcoin is anonymous enough. I expect more consumers and businesses will realize this in 2017. Perhaps President-elect Trump can stop all of this with his new America-centric administration. It’s abundantly clear to any capitalist that this John Doe action is 100% pure anti-American, and exponentially increases the risk of pushing bitcoin businesses to foreign jurisdictions. I wrote about this before, in a consultation response to the British Government on how bitcoin should be handled. One of the most interesting events in 2016 was the “Ethereum Event”, where everything Bitcoin Core and others have been saying about the inherent difficulty and risk involved in writing complex cryptographic software came true, thanks to a single bearded man on a laptop running FreeBSD. Since it was launched in Switzerland, cryptocurrency and bitcoin competitor ethereum has sought to radically extend bitcoin’s capabilities to a new separate database, one that was seen for a short time as the inevitable market winner over bitcoin. This is why Coinbase recklessly took the risk of offering ethereum's native token, ""Ethers"", to their customers. One of the capabilities ethereum enables is the ability to create smart contracts, or agreements based entirely in software that execute rules – loosely speaking it's clauses – entirely in code. Smart contracts are an extra-legal way of parties agreeing on how business is conducted and matters settled. It’s radical, extremely exiting, and the biggest smart contract ever, The DAO, the first “Decentralized Autonomous Organization”, attracted over $140m in investment from people around the globe – and then it was hacked. But it wasn’t really hacked. An attacker found a fundamental flaw in The DAO’s software contract clauses, and contractually drained $59m worth of ether from it, into another contract beneath it. “Ethers” are the equivalent of bitcoin in the ethereum public database and software ecosystem. In response to this attack, ethereum, which is the skeleton that the DAO was built on, had its permanent record reversed by the developers who control it, to reimburse investors who lost ether in the DAO. This is anathema to people in the cryptocurrency space, and caused a group to “fork” ethereum at the point in the transaction record at which the DAO contract hack took place. Forking means the new developers made a complete copy of the ethereum transaction record, and started recording their own, separate record of transactions on to the end of it. There are now two diverging ethereae – one called “ethereum” and the other, “ethereum classic”. Both of the database records of these systems are identical up to the DAO event, their native tokens float freely on exchanges, and as of this writing, the prices of both have essentially collapsed. By any metric, it is a fiasco, and it is an object lesson of why there can only be one bitcoin, and why bitcoin should not fork lightly. Rather than seeing the DAO event as a perfect example of why what are now called cryptocurrencies require regulation, the DAO is in fact a vivid illustration of why bitcoin and software should not be regulated. This DAO event cost a statistically insignificant amount of money to teach a powerful lesson to all market participants, including companies like Coinbase. Without an expensive lesson like this, markets would be less efficient in finding the best models and, as a result, more vulnerable due to the speed of iteration being slower. Those advocating for regulation should bear in mind that these experiments would be taking place in free jurisdictions, and some of them are guaranteed to succeed, like the SegWit extension to bitcoin. If the additions like Segregated Witness were subject to regulation, the pace of bitcoin improvement would slow to a crawl. An example of this innovation stifling in the medical industry are the over 4,000 medicines awaiting FDA approval in the US. This backlog is directly analogous to new bitcoin business models – software – being blocked from release to the public. This is exactly why no bitcoin regulation or legislation must be passed, or even considered openly, as it will signal to entrepreneurs that they are better off in another jurisdiction, just as people travel to free countries to try experimental drug treatments when all FDA approved medicines have failed to cure their disease. The risk of bitcoin is spread evenly to the people who voluntarily choose to work with it. Trying to control bitcoin pushes a far greater risk of a generational national loss on all citizens, one that can never be recovered from once the centre of bitcoin is captured and rooted in another place. In order to foster innovation and to allay any fears of a possible explosion of legislation that will make turning a profit in bitcoin impossible, the jurisdiction that wants to win the battle for bitcoin businesses should enact a single law – a 150-year moratorium on any legislation that touches bitcoin. 2017 is going to be very interesting, and the most welcome change on many fronts is the coming Trump administration, that will hopefully eschew computer illiteracy and embrace The American Constitution and bitcoin, which is synonymous with the frontier mentality of risk taking and American entrepreneurialism. America can still win the bitcoin prize, just as it won with Silicon Valley. The title of “World Center of Bitcoin” is still up for grabs in 2017. And in this piece, I haven't mentioned the looming prospect of the inevitable Venezuelan hyperinflation event, or the appalling fallout of the first shots in the war on cash in India, which triggered a 30% premium on bitcoin in that extraordinary country. If there ever was a time for a service like Azteco, 2017 is it – a frictionless means of buying bitcoin, that reduces complexity to almost nothing and is perfect for the consumer. Combined with the welcome international expansion of Purse.io, the sublime and revolutionary OpenDime and the other products and services that are sure to follow, 2017 is going to exhilarate, entertain, enrich and enrage like never before!

                            5 Things the Bitcoin and Blockchain Industry Needs to Stop Saying in 2017                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/5-things-the-blockchain-industry-needs-to-stop-saying-in-2017/,"In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review special feature, journalist Bailey Reutzel takes aim at some of the dominant talking points in the bitcoin and blockchain space today.   The bitcoin and blockchain industry continues to grow, but as new people begin to take notice, they’re often greeted with the same tired talking points. As we head into 2017, some of those talking points should be left by the roadside entirely. Below, let's review the blockchain tropes that are not only hypocritical, but also unimportant to the greater goal of the technology. Bitwala tweeted a question that was posed to Eric Martindale and his response at this year’s Money2020.  Is there any reason to still give lip service to outrageous predictions about the bitcoin price? Predictions that last year and the year before were all wrong. Bitcoin could hit $10,000 per bitcoin by 2018. Seriously, Tim Draper? I guess there’s still plenty of time for his prediction. Not so much for Pantera Capital’s 2014 prediction of $10,000 per coin that year. Earlier this month, Saxo Bank offered an (albeit 'outrageous') prediction that bitcoin could hit $2,000 next year because of the supposed spending spree of President-elect Donald Trump after he takes office in the US, not to mention the currency restrictions of both China and India. Not only is talking about the bitcoin price irrelevant to its goal as an alternative currency and payment method, but it also does nothing more than spark more speculative fervor. According to Coinbase, about 70% of the transactions on its platform are speculative in nature, while only 30% are used for actual payments. So, hyping the price of bitcoin merely makes day traders richer. Nothing wrong with that, per se, although as I’ve always said, not really the altruistic goal. So let’s stop saying things like this: “If you bought $1k in Facebook shares at IPO and $1k in bitcoin at the same time, your FB shares would be $3200 vs $141,000 for your bitcoin.” Thanks, in hindsight, Roger Ver. We get it, you made millions.  Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, tweeted this with a link to his column in The Wall Street Journal about how blockchain could totally rework corporate structure. In his mind (and many others), centralized institutions will fall to decentralized software protocols that allow people to do everything peer-to-peer. While decentralized networks make sense in some cases, in others they are truly inefficient. They’re hard to manage, ask anyone that’s worked on projects of this nature, including Bitcoin Core developers who lament the process for getting consensus. Many blockchain entrepreneurs speak in broad, abstract concepts (snake oil) that don’t dig into the technicals of how the technology will be able to solve issues faced by those industries. Many times, it’s because these entrepreneurs aren’t exactly clear how and why current industries, like healthcare, operate the way they do. This empty-headed optimism also rubs off on the consumer value proposition as well, with many evangelists wondering why anyone would use paper money, checks, cards or anything other than cryptocurrency to transact. The sentiment is at times pompous, lumping every consumer – from grandmothers to business owners to teenagers – into one category, even though these demographics have very different incentives and disincentives for transacting in particular ways. Andreas Antonopoulos, an industry pundit recently tweeted: 
That’s funny. What happened to “We are all Satoshi?” I guess that only applies if you agree with Antonopoulos. Sounds a bit tyrannical for someone that hates the state. This is exaggerated throughout the sector. When someone disagrees, there’s not civil, educated discourse, there’s bullying. Opponents, or just those with a little different worldview, get verbally attacked by people hiding, many times, behind pseudonymous profiles. The real problem, though, is that while bitcoin developers have created and maintained a protocol for businesses to use, businesses have made it easier to interact with that protocol. And in turn, have onboarded significant amounts of people. This uptake brought even more developers and entrepreneurs, even more consumers and even more investors into the space. As Tim Swanson, director of market research at R3CEV tweeted:  While these companies should give back to the developers of the protocol (just like every company that runs online should give back to the open-source community that keeps the Internet maintained), these businesses still get a voice in the industry. Less than three months before The DAO hack, Stephan Tual, founder and chief operating office of Slock.it, the company that developed the free and open-source software for The DAO, tweeted:  This was after publishing an introductory blog post that stated, “A DAO is an organization that’s self-governing and not influenced by outside forces: its software operates on its own, with its by-laws immutably written on the blockchain, not controlled by its creators.” Immutably, huh? And another one, only a couple of days before the attack, emphasis on the picture from Slock.it, retweeted by founder and chief technology officer, Christopher Jentzsch:  For as much testing and verification as The DAO code supposedly got, no one noticed the recursive calling vulnerability that allowed The DAO attacker to – under the conditions of the code – move more than $60m-worth of investor ether into his own account. Decentralized software cannot code away social problems (a class that many problems are). The DAO, not only its fallout, gives the industry an example. Using the number of tokens an individual holds as a basis for their reputation and, in turn their decision making power, only leaves those less socio-economically sound at a disadvantage, the same disadvantage they struggle with in today’s more traditional systems. In parallel with this mantra is one of victim blaming, one that states that people should be free to invest in whatever they want, and if they lose because of a vulnerability in the code they should have more closely examined the code. It’s the same nonsense that happens when someone’s phone gets hacked and their sexy pictures exposed on the Internet. They shouldn’t have taken them or they should have had better passwords. It’s similar to the cryptocurrency community’s stance on initial coin offerings (ICOs), crowdfunding campaigns that sell native cryptocurrency tokens to people in an effort to fund the development of their platform. But with the belief that those that participate should know every risk, especially in a technological area that’s new and opaque, this has lead many people to get screwed by pump-and-dump schemes and all-out scams. While knowing the risks and how to parse the code is beneficial if not necessary, that doesn’t mean the industry should excuse the scammer from consequences. A more appropriate slogan, which has gained some steam after Primavera De Filippi and Samer Hassan published an academic paper on the topic, is “law is code”. In the paper, the two suggest that law can be defined as code, but that code comes with limitations since it’s difficult to render ambiguous and flexible legal documents into a language for a machine. What is blockchain? It’s a term that many years on, the industry is still trying to define. Typically, the definition depends on whether you put an “a” or “the” before the word. Yet blockchain has also become interchangeable with distributed ledger technology and distributed ledger technology can really be damn near anything that looks to pass information between more than a couple of parties. Pushing the obscurity forward, William Mougayar, author of ""The Business Blockchain"" and an adviser at several blockchain startup projects, tweeted out a link to a post he penned likening blockchain to the Google Docs’ feature for simultaneous editing:  It’s not only confusing, but misleading, stripping bitcoin (which launched the first blockchain) of its delicate balance of economic incentives that make the protocol something more innovative than a traditional database. According to James Wester, a research director responsible for global payments at IDC Financial Insights, the term “blockchain” has lost its mystique. “It works still for outsiders, but inside the industry these blanket terms almost signal that the person you’re talking to doesn’t have a good grasp on what goes on underneath,” he said. So do you or don't you know what you're talking about? Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for the year ahead?

                            Analysts Predict Bitcoin Price Could Reach $800 in 2016's Final Weeks                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/analysts-bitcoin-800-price-2016/," After surging more than 75% so far this year, bitcoin prices could finish 2016 even higher, according to a panel of experts polled by CoinDesk. These market observers pointed to a range of factors when explaining their forecasts, including macroeconomic uncertainty, market dynamics and a currency war ignited by nations attempting to fix their exchange rates. Starting 2016 at roughly $430, the world’s largest and most well-known digital currency has had a great year so far, breaking through $500 in May and then surpassing both $600 and $700 in June, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). On 18th June, bitcoin prices reached $781.31, their highest price thus far in 2016, before falling back from this peak, additional BPI figures reveal. By the end of November, the digital currency was trading slightly north of $740, which represented a 72.5% year-to-date return for the first 11 months. Bitcoin prices pushed higher during the first few weeks of December, reaching an annual high of $788.49 on the 13th of that month. The digital currency's price has fluctuated between $700 and $800 since roughly mid-November, and it will likely finish the year in the upper half of this range, according to most analysts reached by CoinDesk.  Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, emphasized bullish market dynamics when explaining his forecast that bitcoin prices would be in the range of ""$750-$780"" by the end of 2016. “We've seen a healthy dose of new money coming in to support price,” he noted, and stressed that the markets have experienced a “lack of negative/bearish events” that would “trigger an aggressive selloff.” “Barring an unexpected bearish catalyst,” bitcoin prices will finish the year within the expected range, he told CoinDesk. Joe Lee, founder of Magnr, gave similar input when elaborating on his prediction that the digital currency would finish the year close to $800. ""Demand for bitcoin has been consistent throughout H2 2016 with macroeconomic uncertainty driving interest,"" he told CoinDesk, adding: BTCC CEO Bobby Lee also provided an optimistic assessment, telling CoinDesk: ""We like what we've been seeing from a fundamental as well as technical standpoint."" He also spoke to the lack of volatility the cryptocurrency has enjoyed as of late. ""Given bitcoin's price stability over the past few months, I think it will likely finish the year under $800."" However, he added that there's a ""small likelihood of an end-of-year price rally"". One factor that could increase the odds of such a year-end rally is speculative activity. Traders have generally been bullish so far this year, and Whaleclub data shows that the market was 73% long during the first 11 months of 2016. 'Confidence', which measures how much larger than average a position’s size was over a particular period, registered 77% over this timeframe. Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategies Limited, emphasized this key market factor when making his 2016 year-end forecast. ""As we've been bullish for quite some time, we’re not going to stop now,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Over the last two months there has been a fair amount of pushing and pulling from both the bulls and the bears, and with our retracement plays working out very well for us in 2016, we see a year close between 790 USD/BTC and 810 USD/BTC."" While Rabaglia pointed to market dynamics, Kong Gao, overseas marketing manager for bitcoin trader Richfund, emphasized the efforts nations are making to manipulate their currencies, telling CoinDesk that ""the currency war is now full fledged"". While China has generated significant visibility for taking action to devalue the yuan relative to other countries, it is certainly not the only nation making an effort to either strengthen or weaken its native currency. Because of this situation, Gao told CoinDesk ""we predict (65% confidence level) that the [bitcoin] price will rise to about $900."" Providing an even more optimistic forecast, BitMEX co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes believes bitcoin could enjoy even greater gains. He suggested that if the digital currency can breach $800, its “next big place of resistance” will be $1,000. This ""big figure number"" is where bitcoin will finish 2016, predicted Hayes.

                            2016: The Year That Wasn't For Bitcoin                        ",Jim Harper,https://www.coindesk.com/2016-the-year-that-wasnt-bitcoin/,"Jim Harper is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, working to adapt law and policy to the information age. A former counsel to committees in both the US House and the US Senate, he served as Global Policy Counsel for the Bitcoin Foundation in 2014. In this CoinDesk 2016 in Review feature, Harper takes aim at bitcoin's so-called ""successes"" in 2016, arguing that fundamentally deficient dialogue is holding back bitcoin and other blockchain-based monies.   It’s been another banner year for bitcoin investors. The cryptocurrency's price, even in strengthening US dollars, rose more than 75%. Network effects continue to benefit bitcoin – it’s arguably a currency's most important dimension – so there is good reason to think that it will be an engine of wealth for 'hodlers' into the foreseeable future. But if the bitcoin price is driving ever upward against fiat currencies, what's with all the smoke coming out the tailpipe and steam billowing from under the hood? 2016 has been the year that wasn't for bitcoin – its continued growth in importance, usage and price belie retrenchment. Deficits in social capital that were front and center this year suggest that it could be decades, not years, before bitcoin and cryptocurrency reach their true potential. It's true, as Ariel Deschapell wrote for CoinDesk this year, that bitcoin is increasingly recognized as a safe-haven asset. Unlinked to any fiat currency or other macroeconomic factor, bitcoin is a good way to diversify a portfolio. If 5% of the $7tn invested in gold were to migrate to bitcoin, a possibility Barry Silbert of the Digital Currency Group likes to ponder, that implies a bitcoin market cap of $350 billion, or a little under $22,000 per bitcoin. What is keeping the world's bitcoins from reaching 1/20th the value of gold? Well, take a look at the /r/Gold subreddit. Compared to bitcoin's, it's a languid, unpopulated island. The bitcoin subreddits, of course, are warring hives of intense activity and acrimonious debate. There aren't a lot of directly valid data points in the observation, but the suggestion is that wealth accumulates where there is peace. Disharmony in Bitcoinland reflects the dearth of social capital around the project. 'Social capital', of course, refers to the human institutions that enable physical or technical capital to function effectively, fulfilling its purposes. A widget manufacturing plant has value not only because of what went into its design and construction, but because people know how to run it, they know how to secure it against theft, how to fix it, how to sell the products of it and so on. Social capital includes knowledge in broader society of how to use widgets, where to buy them, how to preserve them and a sense of their value. Gold has literally thousands of years of social capital built up around it: Everyone knows what it is. A lot of people own or covet gold themselves. Most people have a sense of how to secure it. There are locations across the globe where gold can be purchased, sold and stored. Everyone has a sense of its lasting value. They have this sense because gold has been thoroughly tested over centuries to establish the physical properties that make it shiny and rare. A substantial worldwide storehouse of customs and expectations also makes it specially prized. There are few unknown or controversial dimensions of gold. By comparison, bitcoin has almost no social capital. It's relatively unknown. Of those who know about it, many doubt its viability. They're not wrong to doubt because information suggesting bitcoin’s lasting value is very hard to find. This includes understandings of value itself, open-source software, cryptography, monetary economics and more. In contrast to gold's shiny, self-advertising color, bitcoin has the scaling debate. It's one of the first things any careful investigator of bitcoin will discover upon pulling back the curtains onto the strange crypto world. The most consequential technical development since the Internet itself has a pronounced way of putting people off. For all the smarts and dedication seen in the bitcoin community, it is a collective computer nerd with all of a computer nerd's faults – as Urban Dictionary says, ""somebody who knows more than the speaker about computers, who by implication has no social skills"". Many bitcoiners also have the Millennial’s trait of not knowing how much they don’t know. At scale, social skills are political skills, and this dimension of social capital is also in short supply. Consider the capacity of anyone in the bitcoin world to convince just about anyone of anything. The year began with the stalling out of the effort to shift to Bitcoin XT, an alternative to the dominant implementation of bitcoin's code. Bitcoin Classic came next. It, too, was introduced without sufficient groundwork to attract broad support in a community that is part utterly indifferent and part rigidly partisan. The year ends with Bitcoin Unlimited making its own run at toppling Core and even its preferred improvements appear unlikely to achieve critical mass. Bitcoin implementations really shouldn't be ""toppled"", of course, for the sake of public confidence. Whatever happens in the debate over the block size limit, the present-day bitcoin community is its own worst enemy. The social capital that the bitcoin space still needs crosses many domains. If it is going to help deliver on global financial inclusion, financial privacy, liberty and monetary stability for the world's people, bitcoin still needs to be popularized and demystified. When it comes to the block size limit and similar matters, the ground beneath those debates should be like a Roman road, deeply underlain by scholarly study of the issues in all their dimensions, including the code, of course, but also security and risk management, economics, cryptography, networks, data storage and more. The forthcoming publication of Ledger, a peer-reviewed scholarly journal focusing in on cryptocurrency and blockchain technology should be widely anticipated. Ledger must establish itself as a universally credible publication. Leading figures and groups should be voluble communicators, not just on bitcoin forums and social media, but in mainstream and trade media, as well as each on their own, easily found channels. Bitcoin business leaders should act consistently with professional standards at all times. This year made clear that bitcoin needs better communications. There are social capital efforts underway, of course. Coin Center continues to calm and educate regulators in the US, whose lead many other countries will follow. The Open Bitcoin Privacy Project is another such effort meant to aid users in protecting their financial privacy. The Bitcoin Foundation was supposed to help develop Bitcoin’s social capital, but the enormity of the task, the diffuse (or lacking) vision of its varying leadership, and some significant early missteps relegated that organization. Despite the appointment of another well-meaning executive director mid-way through the year, the foundation has been achievement-free in 2016. Why does this matter? Technology is about people. It only exists with reference to humans and human ends. The bitcoin ecosystem is not self-actuating or self-correcting. It requires attention and maintenance like any system of human organization. The story of bitcoin in 2016 has been one of retrenchment back from the highs and successes that it could be achieving by now, which go beyond capital gains for tech-savvy investors. It masks the long way the cryptocurrency ecosystem has to go before it truly delivers on its revolutionary potential. Have an opinion on blockchain in 2016? A prediction for the year ahead?

The price has been lingering above this level during a seven-day period in which the digital currency hit a 34-month high. Markets surpassed $760 at 10:00 UTC on 7th December, managing to reach one week above this level early on 14th December, figures show. Bitcoin prices surged to $788.49 on 13th December, which represented the currency’s highest price this year and also its most elevated price since February 2014. Thus far in 2016, bitcoin prices have rarely surpassed $760, according to BPI data. The digital currency surpassed this price on 2nd December, the first time it had exceeded $760 since June, but quickly fell back below this level. Over the next few weeks, bitcoin prices repeatedly flirted with their previous high of $781.31 reached in June, but continually failed to surpass that previous peak. However, on 13th December, the digital currency’s price broke past $781.31, hovering above that price for a few hours before declining back below $780. Image via Shutterstock

According to new filings dated 13th December, Los Angeles-based lawyer Jeffrey Berns has disputed the legitimacy of the IRS effort to obtain three years’ worth of user records. The IRS pursuit of a ‘John Doe’ summons, begun last month, was approved by US Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley on 30th November. Berns – who is being represented by the firm for which he is a managing partner, according to LinkedIn – is asking the court to invalidate its previous approval, or, alternatively, to put in place a protective order to stop the effort in its tracks. He argued that the John Doe summons “would constitute an abuse of process” and blasted the document request proposed by the US tax agency as “overbroad”. Lawyers for Berns argued that the filing wasn’t the result of an effort to protect himself from any kind of tax investigation, writing: When reached for comment, Berns Weiss representatives said the filing was, ultimately, submitted in support of users of Coinbase that could be subject to IRS scrutiny. ""While Coinbase has a business interest in protecting its customers’ private information, it also has a business interest in not being adversarial with government regulators,"" the firm said. ""Further, to the extent that there may be a negotiation with the government regarding a possible agreement for the production of a subset of the information sought by the Summons, Coinbase’s customers should be fully represented in any such negotiation."" Coinbase, when reached, said that it was aware Berns' effort. “We are aware of the motion to intervene filed today by Jeffrey K. Berns in the IRS petition. We are tracking all court proceedings and look forward to engaging the IRS,” the company said in a statement. “We will keep our customers updated on any significant developments with respect to Coinbase's engagement on this matter.” Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Coinbase.

Smith went on to write: Jenkins would go on to put the predictions behind that speech into practice, as the move comes weeks after he started his own fintech startup, 10x Future Technologies, which develops cloud-based banking software, according to Business Insider. In a statement, Jenkins echoed those past remarks. ""Blockchain technology has the potential to reinvent the way we use money and contribute to a finance system that’s high quality, low cost, secure, fair and transparent. I am proud to join a company playing a pivotal role in ushering in a new era,"" he said. Image via YouTube/Chatham House

                            Bitcoin-Powered Marketplace OpenBazaar Raises $3 Million                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-powered-marketplace-openbazaar-raises-3-million/,"The developers behind OpenBazaar, the open-source marketplace protocol powered by bitcoin, have raised $3m in new funding. The new round was led by BlueYard, a Berlin-based VC fund with a focus on early-stage startups that has strongly indicated its support for decentralized markets in the past. VC giants Andreessen Horowitz and Union Square Ventures also took part. OpenBazaar is like a decentralized eBay, connecting buyers and sellers directly through an application-based marketplace. But instead of PayPal or credit cards, the market utilizes bitcoin as a medium of exchange. The project grew out of an earlier iteration, dubbed DarkMarket, which won the Bitcoin Expo hackathon in Toronto in 2014. The new funding comes more than a year after the startup that develops OpenBazaar, OB1, raised $1m in seed funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Union Square Ventures and angel investor William Mougayar, who sits on the startup’s board. The round caps a busy year for OB1, which officially launched the service in April following months of testing. Some of the early listings on the market included caramel waffles, accommodations in Taiwan and marijuana seeds. According to OB1 CEO Brian Hoffman, the next year should be just as busy. He said of the new funding: Hoffman told CoinDesk that the funding will help the startup continue expanding its suite of services, describing it as a kind of “seed 2.0” round. Major items in the pipeline include OpenBazaar 2.0, along with plans to develop value-add services (with an eye to monetization) and integrate with Tor, the anonymous communications network.

At press time, bitcoin's price rose to a high of $788.49, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures reveal, the highest price observed in 34 months. The figure not only surpassed the previous 2016 high of $781.31, but also represented bitcoin’s most elevated value since this summer, when expectations were high about the digital currency's upcoming decline in rewards. However, with today's movements, bitcoin has finally broken through after weeks of flirting with its previous annual high. The digital currency neared $781 several times this month, but up until now, has been unable to surpass it.  Bitcoin prices came within roughly $2 of this previous high yesterday, and then broke through it at 01:45 UTC today, BPI figures reveal. After surpassing this level, the digital currency generated additional gains.  Now that bitcoin prices has surpassed the previous high of $781.31, this price could become a new support level for the digital currency.  Whether this support materializes or not, bitcoin prices have generated very strong returns so far this year, rising more than 80% from roughly $430 to more than $780.

                            Bitcoin's Price Continues to Hover Just Dollars Below its 2016 High                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-continues-hover-just-dollars-2016-high/," After a month of toggling, the price of bitcoin remains just out of reach of its annual high. Since November, the digital currency has repeatedly neared $781.31, the high it set in June, and as we head into the year's final weeks, this game of cat-and-mouse shows no signs of stopping. Bitcoin prices continually surpassed $779 today, rising to as much as $779.35 at the time of report, data from CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) reveals. This mirrored bitcoin's monthly movements, which have seen the price rising to $778.14 on 2nd December and falling back to as little as $757.83. Yet, bitcoin's consistent inability to surpass its annual high of $781.31 could mean this particular level is providing resistance. Should bitcoin surpass this price, it could become a support level, helping provide tailwinds for the digital currency’s price. Still, bitcoin prices have enjoyed a steady, upward movement over the last week, surpassing both $760 and $770, meaning it could well set a new annual high before the year is over.

                            Why Circle's Bitcoin 'Pivot' Isn't What it Seems                        ",Noelle Acheson,https://www.coindesk.com/circle-bitcoin-shift-isnt-what-it-seems/,"Noelle Acheson is a 10-year veteran of company analysis, corporate finance and fund management, and a member of CoinDesk's product team. The following article originally appeared in CoinDesk Weekly, a custom-curated newsletter delivered every Sunday, exclusively to our subscribers.  As you've likely heard, Circle announced this week that it had closed down its bitcoin exchange, a move the mainstream press interpreted as a ""surprising"" pivot away from bitcoin and another nail in the cryptocurrency’s coffin. The reaction is understandable, given Circle's significance in the bitcoin space. But it is wrong, on many levels: Let's go through these points in order, and then take a look at the trend this news highlights. The move is not unexpected: Circle has for some time been signalling its intention to focus on payments. When the company’s first consumer products were revealed in March 2014, the emphasis was already on ""deposits and withdrawals"" rather than ""buy and sell"". As early as May 2014, the company was downplaying bitcoin, calling itself ""an Internet-based consumer finance company"". For the same reason, it’s not a pivot. It is true that the company was “born” on bitcoin, but even at the time of its launch in October 2013, CEO and co-founder Jeremy Allaire recognized that standards would evolve and that bitcoin might not end up being the main digital currency. In other words, even at the beginning, Circle was cryptocurrency agnostic, only at the time bitcoin was the only significant one around. As far back as November 2014, Allaire told CoinDesk that the focus was less about bitcoin than about how people use money. The latest news is merely the confirmation of a strategy initiated some time ago. Circle has not ""pulled the plug"" on bitcoin, as many have reported. Users can still store it in their Circle account and send it to others. Bitcoin will continue to be a settlement token and Spark, the new protocol unveiled this week, is partly based on the bitcoin system. What Circle has done is communicate a conviction that bitcoin will not be a significant form of payment in the near future. While it may be a disappointment for bitcoin fans, this does not deal the sector an unexpected blow. Frustration with the slow evolution is spreading. Nevertheless, the price has been increasing. Innovation on variations of the protocol continues. And progress is being made on scaling solutions, sidechains and much more. Bitcoin may be stuck. But it is not dead. Looking at the bigger picture, Circle’s decision highlights a quiet but fundamental trend: the focus on applications rather than mechanics. While bitcoin, ethereum, Corda and many other protocols continue to make noise, the real action is happening elsewhere. Startups like Circle are putting blockchain efficiencies directly in users’ hands. The technology is important, but users are generally more interested in what the protocols can do. The why has a potentially greater impact than the how, and appealing applications (rather than technicalities) will give blockchains the mainstream acceptance they need to kickstart widespread implementation. So, the main news in this development isn’t that Circle is stopping a service that was never a main feature. It’s that functionalities have improved, and more people than ever will have access to what this progress can offer. Click Here to Never Miss a Weekly Email Again Hand puppet image via Shutterstock

                            Why Bitcoin's Remittance Disruption Slowed to a Crawl                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/why-bitcoins-remittance-disruption-slowed-to-a-crawl/," There was a time when cross-border remittance was expected to be bitcoin’s killer app. It was a simple equation: the global remittance market is huge, and the (often poor) people sending money to friends and family across borders pay high transaction fees that could (in theory) be reduced with bitcoin transactions. And yet, years later, the giants of the remittance market are far from slain, despite the average fees of 7.5%, and the growing crisis of bank ""de-risking"" – strategically refusing to process transfers to or from regions considered to present a high risk of money laundering, terrorism or other illegal activities. So, what exactly are the dynamics of the remittance market that keep Western Union, MoneyGram, etc, at the top of the food chain, and what would it take to chip away at their position? The first thing that caused over-optimism in regards to bitcoin's potential was a belief that tiny transaction fees would translate into low-cost remittance processing. While the low bitcoin transaction fees represent the cost of actually processing a payment, many companies in the bitcoin space have found that the technical costs are often trivial compared to the regulatory ones. In fact, even established players can struggle with the cost of compliance. In 2013, Western Union took a hit to profit margins as a result of the investment needed to keep up with new and existing regulations, and even its increased focus on digital payments rather than cash transfers has brought mixed results in the years since. So, for newcomers to the field without such deep pockets, the barriers to starting out can be prohibitive. Gabriel Abed, CEO of Bitt, an exchange based in Barbados that allows users in the Caribbean to trade bitcoin for US dollars or the local Barbadian dollars, says that its success has been hard won. He told CoinDesk: The problem of remittance is also complicated by the fact that the countries most in need of it often lack the kind of ecosystem necessary to help startups transition from idea to launch. For example, in the US, bitcoin startups benefit not just from access to investors and technical talent, but from the work done by policy groups and the growing number of lawyers specializing in cryptocurrency and distributed ledgers. But companies wanting to break into emerging markets are often forced to strike out alone, taking on tasks far beyond the remit of marketers and product developers. BitPesa founder and CEO Elizabeth Rossiello admitted to feeling like her startup is, at times, fighting an uphill battle in Africa. Rossiello said: BitPesa's story is a case in point. An early darling of bitcoin-based money transfer, they have run into trouble in Kenya where Safaricom – provider of the mPesa mobile money transfer network BitPesa tapped into – blocked their access to the service. This left BitPesa frozen out of the network the company was first built on, even as they expand into new markets like Nigeria and the Democratic Republic of Congo. Against this background, the need for a shake-up in cross-border financial services is become more apparent by the day. In recent years, banks based in Western countries have becoming increasingly aggressive in de-risking, which is throttling access to financial services in many parts of the world. If a trade corridor is considered lucrative, such as that between the US and China, although the costs of conducting due diligence are high, banks on both sides are willing to maintain the relationships necessary to process transactions. But for poorer nations with a low volume of transactions and a higher risk of financial crime, maintaining these cross-border banking relationships (CBRs) is increasingly difficult. In a June 2016 report, a team of researchers from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) spelled out the dangers of the withdrawal of CBRs across the world, noting that smaller nations in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific Islands have been particularly affected. The Caribbean has been hardest hit since its island nations have small populations that are largely dependent on foreign trade. Exchanges like Bitt are doing their best to fight against this trend, but resolving the problem requires cooperation from a range of actors from the state level down to individual service providers, and is far more a political problem than a technical challenge. That said, an IMF report into the withdrawal of CBRs suggests that industry-wide initiatives to lower the cost of compliance will play a key part in reversing the trend. That's where some of the experiments in streamlining KYC compliance that make use of blockchain tech could be of use. Yet, counter to the general trend, in certain locations bitcoin transactions do play a role in the remittance process. Notable among these is the Philippines, a nation from which a large percentage of the population regularly works abroad – some of them in Asian neighbor South Korea, where remittances sent home by Filipinos account for roughly $231m each year. To cater for this market, a group of South Korean startups have developed services to facilitate the transactions, some of them (like PayPhil or Sentbe) using bitcoin to transmit the funds. In fact, bitcoin-powered remittances are now estimated to make up 20% of the remittances sent by Filippino workers in South Korea, often charging transaction fees which are only half of their competitors ($6 on a transfer of $200 rather than $12). Even so, not all in the Asian remittance market are convinced by the suitability of bitcoin. Singapore-based startup Toast, which recently received $1.5m in investment to build an app specifically for remittances, decided to pivot away from using bitcoin as the underlying means of transaction, citing concerns over regulation. And systems in which bitcoin must always be traded for another local currency may continue to run into problems of regulation. Looking at this on a macro level, the growing diversity in the range of companies that will accept payment in directly in bitcoin benefits the remittance market too, especially when those companies provide products or services to regions otherwise affected by de-risking. When a Filipino mother can buy groceries for her family directly in bitcoin or with a bitcoin-enabled service, the problem of sending money across borders could become technical rather than political. But until then, bitcoin will not be able to solve the problem of high remittance fees.

Though subject to final approval by senior Japanese government officials, an annual tax document prepared by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and the Komeito party and published today offers new details on a proposal floated in October by the Ministry of Finance and the Financial Services Agency. The tax remains in place today. Yet if approved by the Cabinet, the plan would institute a grace period in June of next year, with the tax exemption becoming official the following month. The document release is the culmination of discussions between government stakeholders first reported by regional news service Nikkei. Bitcoin startups in Japan have responded positively to the move. Mike Kayamori, CEO of exchange service Quoine, said that the plan to drop the sales tax was expected but represents a “good message to the crypto-currency community”. He told CoinDesk: The move caps a busy year in Japan on the exchange front, as the government moved to mandate registration requirements on companies handling bitcoin sales in the country. Discussions around exchange regulation began in late 2015 between government ministers, who mulled ways to gather information from exchange services. a The deliberations took place within the context of the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that imploded in early 2014, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in lost customer funds.

                            Inside 'Spark': Circle's New Bitcoin-Powered Smart Contract Platform                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/inside-spark-circles-new-bitcoin-powered-smart-contract-platform/," If you needed another sign that we're living in a multi-blockchain world, Circle's latest product reveal might have been it. Overshadowed by the clamor surrounding the startup's decision to end consumer bitcoin services, it was almost lost that it announced it would soon open-source a smart contracts platform it described as an ""evolution"" of its core transaction processing. Called 'Spark', Circle's new tech isn't a blockchain or a new cryptocurrency. Rather, as explained by the company, it uses a combination of bitcoin, other blockchains and traditional settlement rails to further its mission of promoting a global, social payments platform. Still, Circle co-founder and president Sean Neville explained that, for all the backlash the company has so far received, Spark doesn't exactly mark a shift in its vision so much as a refinement of how it will execute on it. Neville told CoinDesk: In other words, transactions would still settle in bitcoin, though Spark could also allow Circle and its money transfer partners to use other networks, whether that’s a separate blockchain network (like ethereum) or a traditional card settlement network (like ACH). ""Bitcoin can be used with Spark today, and other distributed ledgers can also be plugged into it. Traditional private systems can also be added as integrations,"" he said. As explained by Neville, the company has (and continues to see) bitcoin as a protocol more akin to TCP/IP, one of the lower-level, foundational Internet protocols. (He compared Spark to a HTTPS, a top-level protocol that relies on TCP/IP as a base layer). In this light, Neville described Spark as an application designed to run on top of any blockchain or distributed ledger, stating that it could even be compatible with permissioned blockchain technologies such as IBM's Fabric or R3's newly introduced Corda system. Neville suggested that this increased functionality would perhaps better allow its transfer network expand to serve more consumers. ""We are still using bitcoin. We still trade in it, and use it to support the global consumer payment service we're offering. We're just no longer supporting the buying and selling of it as an exchange product,"" Neville said. So, what's missing from the bitcoin protocol? In Circle’s view, Neville said that Spark is designed for payments firms that would want to use bitcoin to transfer money. This means it offers extra tools designed for know-your-customer (KYC) and anti-money laundering (AML) compliance and exchange rate negotiation. ""Spark includes protocols and support for workflow rules, identity, regulatory compliance and exchange rate information, among other things, that we've added to support settlement on blockchains and other rails,"" he continued. Neville said that Circle had hoped the official bitcoin software would perhaps one day be designed with these features, but that he understands that they don't fit into bitcoin's roadmap and why they shouldn't be included or prioritized in the protocol. Nonetheless, in statements to The Wall Street Journal, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire expanded on this critique, asserting that the lack of governance around bitcoin software management was also a factor in influencing its decision. ""We've been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward,"" Allaire told the news source. The added functionality also hints at the design behind Spark. Faced with the prospect of competing against established firms such as PayPal or Venmo, Circle's decision to embrace a platform that could expand on the current bitcoin network, as part of a way to include more banks and FinTech firms, is perhaps not surprising. In statements to CoinDesk, Circle spoke in similarly broad strokes, calling Spark a ""public protocol and API"" and an alternative to traditional settlement. For example, should Circle users want to transfer money to the Philippines, Circle would turn the original funds into bitcoin, which would then be sent overseas to a partner firm like Coins, that would then provide local currency. As such, Neville was keen to stress that Spark intends to be an ""open source project"" one that it will seek to manage collaboratively with partners focused on money transfer. As shown in CoinDesk's Q3 State of Blockchain report, there may be added pressures behind the move given the lack of new bitcoin exchanges seeing investment. Over the course of 2016, investment in infrastructure-layer bitcoin companies (such as exchanges and wallets) has been on the decline, a trend that has extended to new blockchain networks, with existing bitcoin exchanges extending to new markets.

                            Bitcoin's Price is Inching Back Up Toward its 2016 High                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-price-inching-back-toward-2016-high/," Bitcoin prices rose on 7th December, once again moving toward their 2016 annual highs. At press time, the price of bitcoin was up again around the $770-mark, a development that may be surprising given the news a major startup, Circle Internet Financial, would no longer provide customers with the ability to buy and sell the digital currency. The announcement, made yesterday through The Wall Street Journal, has so far had little effect on the digital currency. Bitcoin prices reached $768.32 at 20:15 UTC yesterday, coming within roughly 1.3% of the June annual high of $781.31, according to CoinDesk’s USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI). Even after rising to this daily high of near $770, bitcoin fell short of the five-month high of $778.14 reached 2nd December. Circle had generated significant visibility for being one of the best-funded early bitcoin startups, raising $136m. In June, the startup raised $60 million through a Series D funding round, a development that coincided with Circle announcing the creation of its China-based subsidiary, Circle China. The firm has now said it will focus on a new proprietary blockchain-based protocol called Spark, an unreleased technology that will use bitcoin to move money across borders.

                            What the Blockchain Industry is Saying About Circle's Bitcoin Shift                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-industry-circle-bitcoin-shift-stop-payments/," You could say there was a certain feeling that went beyond the news. On the surface, Circle's decision to stop offering bitcoin buying and selling services might have precedent. The company had long talked about its drive toward social payments, and its belief in the bitcoin protocol as a foundational layer for finance, not a currency for consumers. It may not even be that impactful. Circle will continue trading (buying and selling) bitcoin on behalf of its customers to move money, and it will continue using the protocol as the base for a new hybrid blockchian platform called Spark. Yet, it seemed, in the hours after the news, there was little consensus about Circle's decision and what it meant – it was either a complete surprise or an expected pivot, depending on who you ask. Reactions to the news was, as can be expected, mixed, and frustration among some of the startup's customers – particularly those who were using it as a portal to buy and sell bitcoin in the UK – surfaced on social media as well. One of those who wasn't surprised by the decision was Joe Colangelo, president of the consumer advocacy group Consumers' Research. He argued that Circle has signaled such a move ""for some time now"". He credited the shift to low revenues, arguing Circle could wind up reactivating the service under more favorable conditions in the future. Colangelo told CoinDesk: In comments to CoinDesk, Circle differed slightly, with representatives stating that too much of the business's resources were going to supporting bitcoin buying and selling, something they increasingly saw as different from their core mission. Unocoin co-founder and president Sunny Ray also expressed a lack of surprise, though he sounded a more critical note, calling it ""short sighted"" not to ""embrace"" bitcoin as a digital alternative asset more akin to gold. ""They always said that they’re more interested in the transactional element of bitcoin and blockchain,"" he said of the firm's move. Others didn’t see this news coming. Among the industry segment surprised by the pivot was Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for ARK Investment Management. Saying he was ""puzzled"" by the decision, Burniske speculated that a number of factors may have come into play here. He told CoinDesk: The view proved popular with respondents, though Circle did not indicate the move was connected to the US government's actions to increase digital currency tax collection. Burniske went on to frame the pivot as part of a broader shift among bitcoin startups that have turned their attention to applications beyond the digital currency in a reflection of both sentiment in the finance industry as well as among prospective investors. Further, like Colangelo, Burniske suggested that Circle might not leave its exchange service in the background forever. ""That said, these decisions are not set in stone, and it wouldn't surprise me if Circle someday allows users to buy and sell bitcoin on its platform once again,"" he remarked. Among the seeming winners in the pivot is Coinbase, which, as Circle outlined in a blog post explaining the move, will become the startup’s “preferred exchange”, directing customers to it if they want to buy or sell bitcoin. Tim Draper, who is an investor in Coinbase through the DFJ Venture Fund, argued in an email that the shift followed a loss in market share by Circle in favor of Coinbase. ""Circle lost market share to Coinbase, so they decided to change direction,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Coinbase is the big winner here."" Fred Wilson, another Coinbase investor through Union Square Ventures, said that while he doesn’t understand the motivation behind Circle’s move, it undoubtedly puts Coinbase in a strategic position within the digital currency exchange and wallet space. ""While I can't really comment on why Circle made this decision, it leaves Coinbase as the dominant player in a rapidly growing new market and that feels really good to me,"" Wilson said. Although, not everyone saw this as positive. As R3 researcher Tim Swanson pointed out on Twitter, the wallet and exchange part of the ecosystem is increasingly a less crowded part of the industry. For it's part, Coinbase was tight-lipped about the move, with co-founder Fred Ehrsam stating simply: Surprise aside, some industry observers told CoinDesk that, overall, the move is a smart one on Circle's part. Among those who praised the move was author William Mougayar, who told CoinDesk that it puts Circle in a position to nab a bigger share of the global remittance market. ""They are basically re-incarnating Venmo but with a global reach, and a friendly user interface,"" he said. ""This space desperately needs user-friendly experiences, and front-ending a money transfer app with a familiar UI is good news for consumer adoption."" Needham & Co researcher Spencer Bogart emphasized that Circle isn’t completely leaving bitcoin behind, positing that the startup is looking to trim services that are likely revenue-negative to operate – pointing to other companies in the space that have pivoted in search of more revenue. He also added that the move doesn't reflect poorly on the digital currency itself. ""This doesn’t mean that bitcoin isn’t working and growing (it very much is), it just means that it's very difficult to build a profitable, mainstream, regulatory-compliant business based on Bitcoin today,"" he said, going on to conclude: Pete Rizzo contributed reporting.

                            Bitcoin Price Could Triple in 2017, Saxo Bank Says in 'Outrageous' Prediction                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-triple-2017-saxo-bank-prediction/,"Saxo Bank wouldn't be surprised if the bitcoin price saw big gains next year. The Danish investment bank recently published its annual ""Outrageous Predictions for 2017"", a collection of speculations that it stressed represents more of a fringe outlook than anything official. At the same time, the bank said that these ""outlier"" predictions represent its attempt to get those in the financial industry to think about more extreme possibilities for the year ahead. In addition to off-the-cuff calls that the UK won't actually leave the European Union and that Italian equity prices will soar on the back of an EU-led bailout, Saxo Bank said that, under the right conditions, the price of bitcoin could skyrocket to more than $2,100. Chief among its reasons was the potential for the incoming Trump administration to cause turbulence in the US economy (a reason given by bitcoin traders for recent price momentum). Saxo Bank explained: Though the prediction doesn’t represent an official position, it's not the first bullish indication the bank has made. In 2014, then-current CEO Lars Seier Christensen discussed his ""personal"" interest in bitcoin with CoinDesk, describing it as an opportunity for investors. At the time, he had also hinted at early testing of the tech within the bank as well, though later Christensen would go on to argue that liquidity problems at the time were keeping banks on the sidelines.

                            Circle Cuts Bitcoin Buying and Selling in Product Pivot                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/circle-cuts-bitcoin-buying-and-selling-in-blockchain-pivot/," Circle Internet Financial, once one of the best-funded early bitcoin startups, has announced it will no longer allow customers to buy and sell the digital currency. Confirmed today via an announcement in The Wall Street Journal and first revealed last night in a customer update, Circle said it will now focus on using a soon-to-be-launched proprietary blockchain-based protocol called Spark. Customers can continue to store bitcoin using the Circle app, however, those who want to buy and sell digital currency will be directed to digital asset exchange service Coinbase, once one of Circle's biggest competitors in the brokerage space. Users can still convert bitcoins stored via the service to dollars, pounds or euros and continue sending money via social messaging, without fees. But notably, users will no longer be able to send money to other bitcoin addresses. Despite the changes, Circle maintained that its vision is unchanged, even if the technology it uses will shift. A blog post issued today reads: Currently available in the US, UK and some European countries, the introduction of Spark extends the company's service to The Philippines and Korea, via partnerships with startups Korbit and Coins.ph. In total, Circle has raised $136m, according to data from Crunchbase, most recently raising $60m in a Series D funding round in June that also saw it expand its operations to China.

                            Russia's Controversial Bitcoin Bill Could See Further Delays                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/russia-bitcoin-bill-delays/,"Russia’s finance ministry is reportedly delaying the introduction of a bill regulating cryptocurrencies until sometime next year. According to Russian media source Lenta, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said that the measure could be introduced as early as next fall, though he appears to have indicated that the bill could see further delays. The comments were said to have been made during an interview at an event in London. ""Not until the autumn of next year,"" Moiseev was quoted as saying, according to a translation. Russia’s efforts to develop – let alone pass – legislation related to the technology has come in fits and bursts since 2015, with movement earlier this year stymied amidst disagreement between government officials on the final scope. The measure, as it currently stands, would focus on the creation and proliferation of so-called ""money surrogates"", a classification that would cover bitcoin and other digital currencies. At the same time, the Russian central bank, in tandem with domestic financial institutions, have pursued research into potential blockchain applications. Financial firms have investigated the tech for possible use on their own as well. For its part, the government has also experimented with the tech. In October, Russia’s Federal Antimonopoly Service said it was working in partnership with Sberbank on a document storage project. Image via Shutterstock

                            Why I'm Taking Bitcoin Profits Amid Potential Price Resistance                        ",Tuur Demeester,https://www.coindesk.com/im-taking-profits-amid-bitcoin-price-resistence/,"Tuur Demeester is an independent investor, newsletter writer and editor in chief at Adamant Research. Launched in 2015, Adamant Research provides a monthly newsletter service. In this opinion piece, Demeester discusses his latest bitcoin trades and why he's not conviced the price is poised to rally higher.   The bitcoin price has more than doubled since I first published the report ""How to Position for the Rally in Bitcoin"" little over a year ago. It's been a great run, and I think there is a lot of potential left on the upside, but nothing goes up in a straight line and we are faced with a potential price resistance zone at $700-800. Here's how I see it: in the chart above, the straight line is simply the $700– ¥4,000 price resistance (a potential price target for traders), and the slanted line is the resistance above a cup-and-handle continuation pattern that's been forming for the past two years. Since the price went above $700, I've been selling some bitcoins, some more even today, to lock in profit and give myself some more ammo to buy back if prices drop. On the downside, I see support at the $600 and $450 levels. That being said, the cup-and-handle pattern is a huge deal in my view, and if we break out of it, it could catapult the price well over the previous all-time high – perhaps to $1,600 in short order. For your consideration, the chart below shows the bitcoin price in Chinese yuan. Because of the 10% devaluation versus the dollar, the price has already breached both the¥4,000 and ¥5,000 resistance, big question is now if it can break out of that completed cup and handle pattern:  I remember telling myself to be cautious with my optimism when bitcoin rallied to $30 in early 2013 – because that was the previous all-time high – only to see the price consequently rally up to $260 in a matter of weeks. Since that time, however, bitcoin has matured from a tiny startup currency to the equivalent of a mid-cap S&P 400 stock, making explosive price moves a bit less likely, and currently we're also facing some scalability bottlenecks. Bitcoin transaction fees have increased to at times over $0.15 per transaction, and it'll possibly take another six months to activate on-chain and second layer volume capacity, allowing for lower costs. For the time being, exchanges and other startups are processing millions of off-chain bitcoin transactions per day at very low fees (the trade-off is that this is less secure), which I think shows that the ecosystem is very dynamic. Nonetheless, the hurdles towards secure decentralized scalability are real in my view and so could depress investors' sentiment somewhat in the coming weeks and months. In sum, even though I think we could see a pullback in the short to medium term, I'm optimistic on the prospects of bitcoin for 2017, and I'm still expecting the price to approach or exceed the 2014 all-time highs.

                            New OCC Charter Could Give Bitcoin Exchanges Special Bank Status                        ",Michael del Castillo,https://www.coindesk.com/occ-charter-bitcoin-exchanges-special-national-bank-status/," The office of the US Treasury in charge of currency policy has revealed plans to grant special-purpose bank charters to companies working in the fintech space. The proposal, revelealed on Friday but hinted at as recently as October, is currently open to comment by the public. If approved, the new breed of chartered institutions would deepen a global trend that has leaned toward modernizing existing definitions of what constitutes a bank. The impact on the digital currency and blockchain space would be far more meaningful, observers say. Should it be approved, the move could ""help drive greater mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency"", by giving approved exchange services a greater degree of credibility, according to lawyer Carol Van Cleef, newly hired by Baker Hostetler. But Van Cleef went further, telling CoinDesk that not only could nationally granted bank charters give crypto-exchanges more credibility, but it would simplify the current US system requiring state-by-state money transmitter licenses. Van Cleef said: According to Van Cleef, startup banks (which she has previously helped obtain traditional charters) are required to keep $2m cash on hand, but the actual cost of becoming a bank runs as high as $40m. Van Cleef also attended the Georgetown University Law Center event at which Comptroller of the Currency Thomas J Curry related multiple reasons why the fintech charters could be helpful. But the top benefit was ""public interest,"" he said. ""It is clear that fintech companies hold great potential to expand financial inclusion, empower consumers, and help families and businesses take more control of their financial matters,"" Curry added at the time. Notably, the new FinTech charter push is being undertaken without the involvement of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The OCC has ""taken the position that they don’t need new legislation to create a special purpose program for fintech,"" according to Van Cleef. Companies that seek the charter would be evaluated regarding their likelihood of success, their risk management strategy, the effectiveness of their consumer protection and the strength of their capital and liquidity. Jesse Powell, founder and CEO of cryptocurrency exchange Kraken, says that bitcoin exchanges have been ""captured"" by the existing ""ancient laws"", and noted that he welcomes the proposal. ""Having a rational, federal license to run specific, limited banking functions would be a godsend to the fintech industry, which has to date been severely hobbled by the high costs and lack of options around licensing,"" Powell told CoinDesk. Non-profit advocacy group Coin Center emphasized that, while the federal charter would ""open up"" the possibly of preempting state-by-state licensing laws, it would not completely eliminate the local option. In a recent blog post, CoinCenter director of research Peter Van Valkenburgh wrote: The plans, unveiled last week by the OCC, are aligned with similar efforts currently underway in Switzerland to create a ""crypto-bank"" for digital currency companies. In March, the OCC published a white paper laying the groundwork for ""responsible innovation"" within the banking sector. During a public comment period, several blockchain industry leaders (including Coinbase, Circle and Ripple) have published notes in support of a measure to modernize the regulatory body's requirements, making it easier for tech companies to serve their customers while still ensuring the protection of investors and consumers Then, last month Switzerland’s own Financial Market Supervisory Authority published its plans to create an innovation-friendly environment in which newly conceived “crypto-banks” could thrive while still protecting interested parties. The paper describing the fintech charter is currently available on the OCC’s site and a period of public comments will end on 15th January 2017. While Van Cleef is excited about the potential impact the charter could have on cryptocurrency exchanges and similar kinds of services, she warns the compliance requirements would likely exceed anything the industry has experienced thus far. Van Cleef concluded: Piggy bank image via Shutterstock

                            Intel is Winning Over Blockchain Critics By Reimagining Bitcoin's DNA                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/intel-winning-blockchain-critics-reimagining-bitcoins-dna/," With so much R&D ongoing in the blockchain sector, it's hard for any new tech to separate from the pack. In addition to the sheer volume of designs for these new types of financial databases, separating the interesting ideas often requires ample peer review, testing and time. Still, this messy process hasn't stopped tech giants like IBM and JP Morgan from conducting work that rivals the more well-known open-source creations like bitcoin and ethereum in aim and ambition. While these contributions are grabbing headlines, however, praise across both open-source and enterprise communities has been rare. Bucking this trend is Intel, which is winning support from even normally fickle technologists for its quieter, and some say, more innovative, approach to reimaging bitcoin's tech for the enterprise. One of the main contributors to this perception is proof-of-elapsed-time (PoET), a variation on the system that bitcoin uses to ensure that computers in the network agree about which transactions really took place, which it unveiled earlier this year. Perhaps better known to cryptographers, this high-tech tool solves the computing problem of ""random leader election,"" or selecting who will create the next block of transactions. Despite the lack of attention it's received, however, some veteran technologists consider PoET one of the more novel and radical proposals for how a blockchain network could achieve consensus. Created by developers at Intel, PoET is notably designed to be used on a certain type of computer manufactured by the tech giant, called trusted execution environments (TEE). On one hand, proponents argue that it's a more environmentally friendly algorithm than bitcoin's proof-of-work (PoW). On the other, many open-source developers are skeptical that could be widely used, since it requires trust in Intel. Blockstream principal architect Christopher Allen, whose firm is a member of Hyperledger and one of the largest financial supports of bitcoin development, is one experienced observer that echoes this outlook. Allen told CoinDesk: One of the reasons Allen thinks so positively about Intel's contribution is that it provides a variety of options and consensus algorithms, which he believes allow users to build a private blockchain to meets their needs. ""Sawtooth as a proof-of-concept demonstrates that you can have multiple consensus algorithms,"" said Allen. ""There's no reason Sawtooth couldn't do PoW or proof-of-stake."" Allen mentioned that the working group has been discussing how to create the best architecture for allowing users to choose from a variety of consensus algorithms. That's where PoET comes in, as it’s one of the unique blockchain offerings that Sawtooth Lake makes available. Allen described it as a simulation of PoW that might be best used as an alternative for private blockchains. Since it borrows from PoW's Nakamoto-style consensus, PoET offers some benefits over Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), a type of consensus algorithm used by Hyperledger, Stellar and others, he said. For one, it scales to a larger number of nodes and is more reliable since it works when larger numbers of nodes aren't available. One downside is settlement finality: users need to wait for a certain number of blocks before they can be fairly certain that their transaction will be recorded. But, despite these unique properties, another perspective is that PoET doesn't make sense for either private or public blockchains. ""It's way too easy to create multiple layers of obfuscation that ultimately don't contribute to the underlying security model,"" said Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop. The main critique to emerge is that participants would need to use Intel hardware like SGX to execute code in a protected area that can't be inspected or tampered with. That's how you ""know"" — in theory — that the blocks filled with transactions will be dispensed at a certain interval, and that those transactions are correct. And you know that it can't be tampered because of cryptography involved. ""PoET uses this special processor capability to regulate block frequency rather than computation,"" Sawtooth Lake project manager Dan Middleton said, explaining that by using the protected area of the chip, the code is executed as designed. ""This is what enables the return to one-cpu-one-vote,"" he continued, echoing an idea invoked in Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin white paper. But as for comparisons to PoW, there are notable differences. While PoW enables a trustless system, Bishop called Intel's approach ""trust-maximizing"". That's why both Bishop and Allen are skeptical that the consensus algorithm can be used for a public blockchain, like bitcoin or ethereum. ""It's like giving the keys to the kingdom to Intel,"" as Bishop put it. ""The participants are saying, 'We trust Intel to not cause inflation of the system or otherwise interfere, and we believe Intel would rather shutdown before it would comply with government orders to disrupt a system that uses SGX,'"" he said. But while this probably isn’t good enough guarantee for decentralization advocates, this isn't stopping Intel's work from emerging as part of the conversation on the conference circuit. Indeed, it may now be time for the wider market to assess how the idea could be evolved, for instance, for use on other processors. As far as testing the protocol, a user doesn't necessarily need to purchase a TEE. Middleton added that anyone interested in the protocol can now test how it commits blocks across a distributed network. Allen contends that the use of TEE is why PoET isn't currently as appealing as the more mature proof-of-work protocol, or maybe one day proof-of-stake, both protocols that enable participation via specific types of computer hardware. But he agreed that if other hardware vendors implement the new algorithm, this could lead to other possibilities. ""It would be powerful to see a multi-vendor standard for PoET be created someday, for instance in the multi-vendor RISC-V consortium,"" he said. Like all ideas, it will be up to the market to decide. However, for now, it seems Intel's work has passed one milestone, graduating to larger dicussion and consideration.

                            Bitcoin Prices Surge Past $770 But Fall Just Short of 2016 High                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-surge-just-misses-2016-high-770/,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global blockchain token markets. This edition looks at the week from 26th November through 2nd December.  Bitcoin prices neared $780 during the week through 2nd December, coming within 1% of the 2016 high of $781.31 reached in June. The digital currency rose to a high of $778.14 amid sustained support. Prices remained above $700 all week and only briefly fell below $725, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data reveals. Bitcoin prices have been enjoying sustained support, as they have managed to stay north of $700 for more than two weeks, having surpassed that level on 14th November, BPI figures show. The market is highly bullish, according to sentiment data provided by leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. Between 26th November and 1st December, the market fluctuated between 82% and 89% long, maintaining an average of 85% long during the six-day period. Petar Zivkovski, Whaleclub’s director of operations, told CoinDesk: Zivkovski spoke to continued trader interest, telling CoinDesk that he also believes the price rise is fueled by new bitcoin buyers. ""Price has made a series of higher highs and higher lows, which indicates that there is still enough new money coming in to the system to push price to new levels."" Analysts indicate that bitcoin prices are further receiving support from a handful of macroeconomic developments that have helped drive market participants to the digital currency. For example, China recently imposed additional capital controls in an effort to reign in outflows and help reduce the yuan’s continued slide against the US dollar. As the Asian nation's efforts to control its currency continue to draw headlines, cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff pointed to data supporting the notion that China is playing a key role in bitcoin trading. He told CoinDesk: Another development that has stuck out as potentially supporting bitcoin’s recent price movements is India Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s efforts to take 500 and 1,000-rupee notes out of circulation. While this move has been justified as an attempt to help reduce corruption and black market activity, it could potentially push India into a liquidity crisis. Modi has pointed to a survey, conducted through a smartphone app, which shows 90% of participants supporting the move to eliminate these banknotes from circulation. However, the move has drawn the opposition of both opposition parties as well as former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. Zivkovski made reference to this situation, telling CoinDesk that he believes this situation has boosted bitcoin's outlook. ""The Indian crackdown on cash/rupees has most probably contributed to the rise [in bitcoin prices] with the injection of fresh money and bitcoin users from India,"" he said. Elsewhere, ether, the digital currency powering the ethereum platform, continued to struggle this week, falling to its lowest price since April. Ethereum has faced several challenges lately, including undergoing three forks in the space of a few months as the platform attempts to overcome technical challenges. Ethereum underwent a hard fork dubbed ‘Spurious Dragon’ on 22nd November, which was an attempt to rectify some complications that stemmed from continued attacks on the network. An attacker had left a significant number of empty accounts in the blockchain, and Spurious Dragon gave developers a way to remove these accounts. While this hard fork represented an improvement, two major Ethereum clients – Geth and Parity – implemented the code from this fork in different ways. As a result, there came a point where the two clients did not agree on deleting a certain account. While Geth did delete the account, Parity failed to do so, which resulted in a brief split in the network or ""Thanksgiving fork"". In spite of Ethereum’s continued challenges, several market observers have spoken out about the network’s recent progress, pointing to what they called progress in fundamentals such as mining distribution and unique address growth. Zcash prices have calmed down a bit lately, trading in a range between $60 and $80 for most of the week, Poloniex figures reveal. The digital currency traded within this range after experiencing far greater fluctuations earlier in the week, falling more than 25% from $89.45 at roughly 12:00 UTC on 26th November to $65.59 at 22:00 UTC on 27th November. The currency’s available supply is now roughly 133,000 ZEC, a figure that represents less than 1% of the 21 million ZEC tokens that are scheduled to be mined over time. Both Zivkovski and Eliosoff emphasized that at this point, adoption is crucial to supporting the price at current levels, given that supply will continue to increase. Thus far, Zcash has showed promise by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKS to enable counterparties to conduct transactions without revealing themselves. However, the cryptocurrency has thus far obtained little adoption; Until the digital currency has a viable use aside from trading, its value is highly speculative.

                            Coders Named After Harry Potter Characters Join Bitcoinâs 'Mimblewimble'                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/coders-harry-potter-bitcoin-mimblewimble/," One of bitcoin's more forward-looking projects has attracted a group of developers who are usingÂ some obscure names from the Harry Potter book series. Bearing the names of the book series' invisibility cloak inventor (Ignotus Peverell), itsÂ leading wand maker (Garrick Ollivander) and theÂ mother of its main antagonist (Merope Ripple), the developers areÂ now working onÂ the first version of Mimblewimble. First proposed by a cryptographer who usesÂ French version of Tom Riddle (better known as Lord Voldemort), Mimblewimble describesÂ a unique way of solving some of bitcoinâs more pressing problems. By rearranging bitcoinâs transaction structure in such a way, the proposal helps with two things: scaling the bitcoin network to a greater number of transactions and increasing the privacy of user's transactions.Â The downside of Mimblewimble is that its alternative transaction structure doesnât work with the existing bitcoin network, so this code may ultimately come to form theÂ basis for future implementation as a sidechain or an altcoin. In an effort to bring the theoretical project to life, bitcoin experts such as Blockstream mathematician Andrew Poelstra and Bitcoin Core contributor Bryan Bishop have takenÂ an active interest in the project, with Poelstra putting forth a white paper that refines the idea and offers ideas for further scalability improvements. While Lord Voldemort disappeared after debutingÂ his paper, pseudonymousÂ developers bearing the names of Harry Potter characters went on to takeÂ the reins and beginÂ working on an implementation based on the originalÂ concept. According to Poelstra, the jury is still out as toÂ the true identities of these developers. HeÂ told CoinDesk: Shortly after the paper's debut (and its author's departure), Ignotus Peverell took the role ofÂ ringleader, putting Lord Voldemortâs theory into practice in a project called grin. He or sheÂ described the open source project as ""very far from complete"" uponÂ publishing it inÂ the bitcoin-wizards IRC channel, a popular place to chat about technical bitcoin details. On 29th October, Garrick Ollivander joined ranks to ""fix a merkle tree malleability"", among other updates, sparking a new round of excitement for at least one developer. ""And sure enough here was yet another Harry Potter character showing up doing Mimblewimble stuff which was super exciting. I was super jacked. I went for a long run around Austin to let my excitement out,"" Poelstra saidÂ at a recent bitcoin meetup. The entry of Ollivander was followed by Merope Riddle, who made several contributions in late October. Despite the attention from more ""wizards"", Poelstra noted that the project is not yet usable, but that it's ""making steady progress"". Image Credit:Â Ingus Kruklitis / Shutterstock.com

According to an application published on 24th November by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), Coinbase is aiming to patent a “security system forming part of a bitcoin host computer”. Coinbase submitted the application in May of last year, with software engineers Andrew Alness and James Hudon listed as inventors. The startup, which has raised more than $116m in venture capital to date, has sought other patents in the past. The last few months have seen a flurry of activity on the patent front, as the USPTO has released applications from startups like Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, as well as major firms like AT&T and Nasdaq, that are related to the tech. Coinbase explained in the application: When reached for comment, the company pointed to a blog post from September of last year penned by co-founder and CEO Brian Armstrong detailing its plans to seek patents “to keep them out of the hands of bad people”. “We support innovation and development in the space and hope to facilitate through sharing of IP,” Coinbase said in an emailed statement.

Launching with $20m in committed capital, HBV will now seek to invest the funds over the course of the next six to 12 months. The fund will be managed by James Wo, the son of Huiyin Group founder, and focus on improving the blockchain ecosystem through investments in infrastructural projects and new use cases. But while the firm may have ""blockchain"" in its name, those close to the fund suggested the firm is unlikely to invest in enterprise or so-called alternative blockchain projects. Wo indicated that the fund will have a special focus on projects building on or otherwise supporting the bitcoin blockchain. Wo said in a statement: The firm has already started investing through their fund, backing Indian bitcoin brokerage Unocoin, content monetization platform Yours and Purse.io, a bitcoin-powered e-commerce marketplace. Purse CEO Andrew Lee will also serve as an advisor to the fund. For Huiyin Group, HBV's parent fund, the announcement follows its more recent move into the technology sector. (Huiyin Group is a family-owned investment group that has focused on traditional industries like real estate, energy and agriculture). But in the past few years, Wo and his father have taken a personal interest in bitcoin, which ultimately led to the creation of the new fund.

                            Bitcoin's Black Friday Finds its Niche Outside the Mainstream                        ",Bailey Reutzel,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-black-friday-merchants-narrow-niche/," While momentum for bitcoin as a consumer payment method has waned, Bitcoin Black Friday is still attracting attention from merchants its fifth year on. The event, a bitcoin version of the usually aggressive, post-Thanksgiving shopping spree, started in 2012 as what its founder Jon Holmquist calls ""a half-baked idea"". But that impromptu first year has blossomed into a steady stream of demand from merchants catering to bitcoin-holding enthusiasts. This year, more than 150 merchants participated in the event, a figure that was down sharply from 2013, when roughly 600 businesses sold goods. However, there was a notable difference in its target audience in 2016. Rather than going after more mainstream merchants, Holmquist has shifted focus, positioning the event to attract businesses more likely to win heavy users of the digital currency. This has meant targeting adult entertainment sites and bitcoin product providers to promote their Black Friday deals. He told CoinDesk: But while merchant numbers are down, Holmquist saw an increase in traffic to the site, which in his mind means the slump since 2013 is over. ""At least in bitcoin consumer spending, from this point onwards it's healthy, use case based growth,"" he said. ""The growth and attention is no longer smoke and mirrors hype, it is real spending."" Holmquist thinks the pick-up this year is due to the bitcoin-first merchants, many of which offered unique products only found on the Bitcoin Black Friday website as part of the promotion. Focusing on products and services that bitcoin enthusiasts are interested in will be the focus going forward, he said, and merchants involved agree. ""We are doing more and more sales every year, and most those sales are driven by the bitcoin community … which is growing,"" says Eric Larchevȇque, co-founder and CEO of French startup, Ledger. The firm, which sells hardware wallets specialized for cryptocurrencies, sponsors the event's official website. ""From our point of view, bitcoin usage isn't shrinking in any way,"" he continued. For instance, Ledger sees spikes whenever the price of bitcoin rises or there's a hack at any of the mainstream bitcoin exchange providers. As far as Bitcoin Black Friday, Ledger has been participating for three years, stretching the event throughout the weekend. In 2014, the impact wasn’t huge, Larchevȇque says. But the first version of the hardware wallet, Ledger Nano had just been launched. The second year was more interesting. Ledger sold about $5,200 in sales in one day, about ten times more than it had ever sold in a 24-hour span, Larchevȇque says. And those were sales on traffic Ledger wouldn't have been able to pull in on its own. ""Last year I don't think that our brand was that well known to drive the people to the [Bitcoin Black Friday] site,” he said. ""It was more opportunistic sales. A lot of the traffic we got was enthusiasts just wanting to spend their bitcoin."" This year, Ledger sold almost 1,000 units for total sales a little south of $100,000, which according to Larchevȇque is an order magnitude more than last year. Plus the company had five times the traffic this year as compared to last Black Friday. And the event is a good time to spend bitcoin, since all the merchants, similar to the traditional event, offer discounts and deals. For instance, Ledger gives 21% off on all its products Friday through Sunday. Ledger even launched its new product, Ledger Blue, a Bluetooth- and NFC-capable touchscreen hardware wallet during the event. But there are also merchants involved for ideological reasons. Néstor Romeral Andrés, the founder of NESTORGAMES, uses the event to sell unique board games he creates to bitcoin users. During the year, he might not get a bitcoin transactions for months, but during Bitcoin Black Friday he secures a number of sales. Andrés learned about bitcoin through Max Keiser, an American broadcaster known for his heterodox economic theories. To him, decreasing bitcoin transactions is a sign of people understanding bitcoin is ""good money"" (as opposed to government-backed fiat currencies). But Andrés's sentiment is a dying one. ""A lot of the interest has shifted away from bitcoin and into blockchain,"" Holmquist acknowledged. Which makes the Back Friday event one by and for bitcoiners. This ebb has made the event much less work for Holmquist. (Not as many merchants are enthusiastic about accepting bitcoin and he doesn’t get as many media requests). But there are signs the event could continue to serve a purpose for a smaller market. Because of possible legal repercussions, Holmquist hasn’t allowed online gambling sites or legal marijuana sellers to promote, although Mary Jane merchants will likely get a shot on the site in 2017. Those industries, Holmquist said, could be ripe for expansion.  Black Friday image via Shutterstock

According to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), the digital currency first reached the six-month mark at 20:30 UTC, as it rose above $500 on 28th May. At press time, bitcoin was trading above $730 on the BPI. This time frame represents the longest stretch in history where bitcoin has remained above $500. Even though the cryptocurrency surged to more than $1,100 in late 2013, reaching $1,165.13 on 30th November, it quickly fell back, declining below $500 on 18th December, 2013. Even discounting this one-day dip in price demand, that period above $500 came to an end in mid-March, marking a sustained value above this market for just over four months. Putting this in perspective, the digital currency has repeatedly displayed significant volatility, so its ability to remain above this crucial level of $500 for a sustained period might prove promising to those advocating the digital currency. Some market observers have repeatedly criticized bitcoin's volatility, using it as evidence that bitcoin is not a ""real"" currency or sound investment opportunity.

                            EY Switzerland Will Accept Bitcoin Next Year                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/ernst-young-switzerland-bitcoin-payments/,"The Swiss branch of global professional services firm Ernst & Young is set to begin accepting bitcoin payments next year. Starting in January, EY Switzerland will accept bitcoin for invoice payments, the firm said last week. The company will also launch a new bitcoin ATM at its office in Zurich, as well as a dedicated wallet option for EY employees. The launch is, perhaps, an extension of the ongoing cultural experiment involving the digital currency in Switzerland. Late last month, Swiss railway service SBB made international headlines after it announced that it would sell bitcoin through its nationwide network of ticket kiosks. SBB is planning to test the purchase option over a two-year period. The city of Zug began accepting bitcoin payments for public services in May, and in the country’s capital, legislators have begun looking at the question of regulation. According to EY, the launch fits squarely within this experimental context. Marcel Stalder, EY Switzerland’s CEO, said that the company wants its employees to have a working knowledge of digital currencies and blockchain. One way to do that, he said, is to provide ways to access a hands-on education. Stalder said in a statement: EY is just one of the so-called Big Four accounting firms actively involved in the blockchain space today. It recently hosted a competition that led the firm to spotlight three startups that have been working with the technology. Earlier this year, EY helped the Australian government auction roughly $16m in bitcoin confiscated during an investigation of a Silk Road user. Image via Shutterstock

                            A Major Insurer is Developing a Policy to Cover Bitcoin Exchanges                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/major-insurer-policy-bitcoin-exchanges/,"A Japanese insurance firm is reportedly planning to launch a new policy line aimed at bitcoin exchanges. According to Nikkei, Mitsui Suitomo Insurance is working with Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange bitFlyer to develop the policy. The publication reported that the insurer will offer as much as 1bn yen (roughly $9m USD at press time) in terms of coverage, with premiums ranging as high as “several million yen”. It’s not immediately clear when the insurance product would be launched. The launch within Japan would be notable given the collapse of Mt Gox, the now-defunct bitcoin exchange that fell apart in 2014, resulting in the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoin. While the Mitsui Suitomo policy would only cover a fraction of that amount, the launch could offer a degree of comfort to users, as well as regulators overseeing activity in the digital currency exchange space. News of the insurance product comes as Japan’s financial services industry adopts a generally more aggressive stance toward digital currencies and blockchain. Earlier this month, a group of 42 Japanese banks joined SBI and distributed ledger startup Ripple to form a new cross-border payments consortium. Individual firms, particularly banks, have tested a variety of applications in recent months. Japan’s government has set the stage for such action as well. In October, local sources reported that national finance regulators were weighing whether to scrap a sales tax on bitcoin purchases. Regulators and members of the country’s legislature have already moved in the past year to rethink bitcoin exchange oversight. Image via Shutterstock

                            Why Aren't Bitcoin Businesses Talking About SegWit?                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/why-arent-bitcoin-businesses-talking-segwit-protocol-upgrade/," By most accounts, the activation of Segregated Witness (SegWit) should be a boon for bitcoin. The code has been introduced to the network, and at least 20% of bitcoin's hashing power is now signalling support for the software change. First proposed last December, SegWit is expected to provide the first significant boost in capacity to the bitcoin blockchain in its near-decade-long history. While the mechanics of its rollout ensure that its implementation is not a forgone conclusion, to the technical community, SegWit is seen as a significant technical milestone. As described by Blockstream's Greg Sanders, the change (even at proposal) is one of the ""largest ever"" to the bitcoin code base. ""It touched nearly every part of the codebase – serialization, peer-to-peer, wallet, codebase. That doesn't happen very often,"" he said at the Scaling Bitcoin conference this year. Yet, despite the promise the technology holds, the bitcoin startup community has so far only tepidly embraced the idea that Segregated Witness will bring benefits. As summed up by Blockchain CEO Peter Smith, the view from consumer-facing firms that have seen usability issues while debate and testing were ongoing is more measured. Smith told CoinDesk: Smith's comments point to the effects of the months of public fighting that ultimately led to the introduction of the code, and the general sentiment among entrepreneurs that the bitcoin block size will need to be adjusted upward eventually to accommodate more users. The viewpoint has contrasted with how Bitcoin Core, the software's main development project, has conducted work on the bitcoin protocol, which has seen it arguably prioritize optimizations that enable the software to be more effective within current constraints. Regardless of how it was created, the resulting impasse has fostered the conditions under which bitcoin businesses aren't quite championing the change, however well-considered or beneficial it may be when (or if) it is implemented. One bitcoin startup, for example, declined repeated attempts to discuss the news, with one of its executives ultimately explaining that there was ""little upside"" in commenting on the issue. ""I'm guessing some folks just don't want to get in the middle of anything that might have to do with the Core roadmap, positively or negatively,"" he said. The lack of dialogue has not gone unnoticed. Industry analysts like Cato Institute's Jim Harper said that SegWit has perhaps suffered from the poor state of community dialogue, which he critiqued as divisive and ill-meaning. ""For me, this illustrates the crying need for greater social capital in the bitcoin world – deep research into every dimension of bitcoin as a technology and as a tool,"" he told CoinDesk. ""Reddit subs shouldn’t dominate, but should be second-fiddle to serious, carefully framed discussion in journals, academic conferences and among computer scientists, economists and other experts."" The comments are supported by ample observational evidence. Bitcoin now has two dominating Reddit forums (r/btc and r/bitcoin), both of which have shown a tendency to echo the MSNBC/Fox News-style schism observed in media more broadly. While r/bitcoin appears friendlier to Bitcoin Core, r/btc has championed alternative development teams, as well as the investors willing to devote capital to such explorations. In this light, Harper credited the lack of dialogue to the ""extreme hostility"" that has characterized the debates ongoing in these environments. This view was supported by Wedbush Securities research director Gil Luria, whose firm for years has issued forecasts on the potential market impact of the technology. ""The reluctance of bitcoin companies to react to SegWit either way could be a result of the desire to keep options open and avoid getting unnecessarily involved in what is still somewhat of a political debate,"" Luria said. That's not to say there isn't positivity about the changes in bitcoin's business community, it's just that there has yet to be a galvanization of sentiment around the issue (like, say, what happened when many startups spoke out against the New York BitLicense). Smaller consumer-facing bitcoin startups appear more apt to be vocal about the protocol change, particularly because it would make way for other upgrades – including the Lightning Network and sidechains (both solutions expected to bolster capacity and functionality). Respondents who met this profile were more likely to show an appreciation for benefits that would remove business pressures that have resulted from a lack of available block space. Sebastian Serrano, CEO of bitcoin processor BitPagos, for instance, said he expected SegWit would reduce the time it would take partner companies to send funds, as well as reduce the cost his company pays in mining fees. Even firms like Coinbase, whose executives have long been highly critical of the Bitcoin Core development group, offered praise (however faint) for the proposal. The company said in a statement: The comments are notable given that Coinbase has been one of the more vocal critics of Bitcoin Core and what its executives perceive as their inability to adjust development timelines in accordance with business pressures. Representatives of Bitcoin Core largely agreed that bitcoin businesses seem to want to ""quietly adopt"" SegWit without much fanfare. In the face of critiques, the group has argued that the long rollout has been necessary given the strain of testing, as well as the burden it has placed on Core's working processes. In Milan, Sanders spoke of the difficulty in coordinating activity. In one instance, he cited a situation in which there were too many Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) submitted, some of which had overlapping aims due to their sheer volume. The comments point to perhaps a central disconnect in the larger public understanding of Bitcoin Core's processes, and how despite the nature of bitcoin as a well-oiled blockchain, its upkeep requires time and resources that (outside of the altruism of a few for-profit companies) is still largely volunteer. In statements, representatives of the group disagreed with CoinDesk's findings, arguing our questions may have been disadvantaged by their intended public nature. In their survey of businesses, they said the business and startup community is ""widely anticipating"" the rollout of SegWit and its forthcoming benefits. Bitcoin Core representatives further cited the fact that nearly 70 businesses operating on the bitcoin blockchain have indicated that they plan to upgrade to the code. But comments from companies like Blockchain perhaps suggest that this technical readiness doesn't amount to a full-fledged endorsement. In statements, Smith was keen to note that it remains a possibility SegWit won't be enacted. This remains a possibility that's both technical and political. Due to the need for the upgrade to appear ""non-contentious"", SegWit requires that 95% of bitcoin miners show support for the upgrade consistently over a two-week timespan. Complicating matters is that Bitcoin.com and ViaBTC, two mining pools with a combined 9.3% of the bitcoin hash rate, have pledged to support alternatives to the Bitcoin Core software that would more rapidly increase the block size. Of course, both mining pools are comprised, in part, by independent miners who have joined the pools for profit, meaning that these miners could withdraw their support. But as of now, both could effectively stop SegWit from activating, Smith noted. Other respondents put forward the idea that even with SegWit, future increases to capacity (and possibly block size) would be needed. (Members of Core agreed, citing it as a niche belief that bitcoin wouldn't ever increase its block size). Bitflyer CEO Yuzo Kano, for instance, said he didn't know if SegWit would be ""sufficient"" to fix the ""block size issue"" stating that he is ""pro bigger blocks"" because he believes it would make bitcoin more user friendly. The comments showcase how, despite the short-term divisions, there remains a still significant agreement in the project's overarching aims. He said: Man with tape over mouth via Shutterstock

This article covers 19th to 26th November.  Bitcoin continued to trade at elevated levels this week, repeatedly breaking past $750 and coming within reach of annual highs. Having traded above $700 since 14th November as strong market sentiment fueled demand, bitcoin prices reached nearly $755 during the week, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) figures. While this appreciation allowed the digital currency’s price to come within $30 of the annual high of $781.31 reached in mid-June, bitcoin prices soon fell to as little as $713.13. Amid declines like these, many market participants have put themselves into position to ""buy the dip,"" said Petar Zivkovski, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. ""A relatively high amount of new money is coming into the system"" to fuel this speculation, Zivkovski told CoinDesk, adding:  Joe Lee, founder of leveraged bitcoin trading platform Magnr, also spoke to the rising enthusiasm surrounding bitcoin. In addition to bitcoin's near annual highs this week, prices will enjoy their longest stretch above $500 – as long as they remain north of this key level through the end of November, Lee said. Many market observers have pointed out the important relationship between macroeconomic events and bitcoin prices. Lee, for example, stated that Magnr’s data supports the idea that there is a very strong correlation between these prices and factors like the US election or changes in Chinese monetary policy. In recent months, market observers have repeatedly pointed to Chinese capital controls as helping push bitcoin prices higher. If the nation’s monetary policies cause the USD/CNH exchange rate to fall below 7.00, the bitcoin price will break out of its current trading range, BitMEX co-founder and CEO Arthur Hayes told CoinDesk. Zivkovski also spoke to the importance of macro events, emphasizing that while long positions have piled up, these speculative wagers could potentially trigger a long squeeze, driving prices lower. ""For price to keep going up, there would need to be a macro-catalyst such as wide-scale adoption of SegWit,"" he said. ""Market dynamics alone indicate that profit-taking is more likely."" While bitcoin prices may need macroeconomic events to rise in value, both ether (ETH) and ether classic (ETC) suffered price declines this week amid continued technical challenges. Though the former declined 8% week-over-week, the latter fell 15.5%, Poloniex figures reveal. Ethereum underwent its fourth hard fork, ""Spurious Dragon"", on 22nd November. This latest change in the ethereum protocol empowered developers to delete accounts that had been left all over the network by an unidentified hacker. Spurious Dragon is ethereum’s third hard fork in four months. While that fact in and of itself may not do much to inspire confidence in the platform's underlying technology, Spurious Dragon ran into a snag on 24th November. Jacob Eliosoff, cryptocurrency fund manager, explained the situation, saying: “""Neither of the two main clients (Geth and Parity) had implemented the fork's intended logic correctly,"" and both clients became ""buggy"" in different ways. ""This resulted in a mini-fork of the chain, now reunited, but, from what I've seen, not in a very reassuring way,"" he told CoinDesk. Eliosoff emphasized that, on one hand, this whole situation revealed ""more amateurism, more cause for caution and investor pullback"". “On the other hand,"" he added, ""the price hasn't dropped much considering (net ~3%, after bouncing back from a quick plunge), which suggests a decent buffer of opportunistic buyers."" While ethereum encountered some challenges this week, ethereum classic worked to further define its identity. Chris Burniske, blockchain products lead for investment manager ARK Invest, commented on the situation. ""It appears to me that ethereum classic is gravitating towards bitcoin-esque attributes, like immutability at all costs and capped supply,"" he told CoinDesk. ""While I understand the inherent value of these attributes, it positions ethereum classic as more of a competitor with bitcoin, which is an awkward place to be."" Zivkovkski described ETC as “the ‘anti-establishment’, fully decentralized version of ETH”, stating that it has “managed to carve a niche in an already crowded market”.

According to an application published earlier this month by the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), 21 Inc is seeking a patent for ""digital currency mining circuitry with adaptable difficulty compare capabilities"". The application was originally filed on 6th May, 2015, with 21 co-founders Nigel Drego, Veerbhan Kheterpal and Daniel Firu named as inventors. The application is the second for 21, which submitted a similar application in April 2014 that was published in October of last year. Bitcoin mining is an energy-intensive process by which entities on the network race to create the next valid block of transactions, and the successful addition of a block nets the miner 12.5 fresh bitcoins, worth roughly $9,200 at current prices. In the years since bitcoin's creation, mining has evolved from smaller, home-based setups to data center-based operations that run hundreds of machines simultaneously. According to the application, it's the rise of specialized bitcoin mining hardware that resulted in a need to develop improved methods for chasing the next block. The application states: The filing is notable given that 21 Inc had worked with Intel on the development of a bitcoin mine that began operating in 2013, using chips from the Santa Clara-based technology firm as detailed in documents obtained by CoinDesk last year. 21 has gone on to build its strategy around the Bitcoin Computer released in September 2015 and aimed at creating a basis for machine-to-machine payments using the digital currency. The startup, which has raised more than $100m in venture funding to date, launched a software suite in May as part of a push to expand the concept to other devices. The USPTO has published a number of bitcoin and blockchain patents in recent weeks, including those from startups Blockstream and Digital Asset Holdings, as well as established firms like AT&T and Nasdaq. 21 did not respond to requests for comment.

                            Uganda Takes its First Steps Toward Bitcoin Regulation                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/uganda-africa-first-steps-bitcoin-blockchain-regulation/," A UN organization focused on criminal justice issues has released details about a meeting on bitcoin and digital currencies this past summer in Uganda. Held in Kampala on 7th July, the meeting drew support from the United Nations African Institute for the Prevention of Crime and the Treatment of Offenders (UNAFRI); the Bank of Uganda; and the University of Birmingham Law School. Dr Maureen Mapp, a teaching fellow for the University of Birmingham Law School who spearheaded the event, told CoinDesk that the aim of the event was to establish a basis from which bitcoin regulation could be crafted in Uganda. Should the effort move forward, Uganda would be one of the first African countries to regulate bitcoin. (Data from CoinDesk Research shows that interest on the continent is growing, but that its startup sector lags behind other startup sectors internationally). Indeed, Mapp said the effort grew out of a digital currency research project conducted with the Commonwealth Secretariat that showcased to her how Ugandan public officials were largely in the dark about the technology's benefits and risks. Mapp told CoinDesk: The overarching goal, she explained, was building awareness, as well as setting the stage for future discussions. Working with the Ugandan central bank and later UNAFRI – which helped fund the July gathering – Mapp began contacting stakeholders within the country to put together what became the meeting at UNAFRI’s campus in Kampala, Uganda’s capitol. Among the outcomes of the meeting is a think tank dedicated to the ""technological, policy, pluralist, ethical and legal issues"" surrounding digital currencies, composed of the organizations and representatives that attended the July meeting. Those involved also developed a draft framework for future discussions between private and public stakeholders, which was published earlier this month by UNAFRI. Next steps include the preparation for a second meeting, set to take place on the same date in 2017. But ahead of that, the gears are already in motion for future regulatory or legislative moves in Uganda. ""The legal and regulatory environment is moving towards embracing the technology so as to harness its benefits and to promote innovation,"" she said. Before that, stakeholders need to agree on the right approach to regulation. Self-regulatory and public-private partnerships are currently on the table, according to Mapp. ""Another concern is how to mitigate any risks in order to protect the public interests, but without stifling innovation,"" Mapp explained.

                            Bitcoin Pioneer Charlie Shrem Launches New Blockchain Venture                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-charlie-shrem-launch-intellisys-capital/," ""You're going to have bitcoiners owning stakes in septic tank companies."" If early bitcoin entrepreneur Charlie Shrem's newest venture (his first since his release from prison earlier this year) goes to plan, the results could offer new – and unusual – ways for digital currency users to invest. Called Intellisys Capital, the startup (co-founded by CEO Jason Granger) intends to offer a private equity investment portfolio in which tokens representing shares in a portfolio of ""middle market companies"" are issued on the ethereum blockchain. Announced at CoinDesk On Tap in New York today, the venture is Shrem's first since his first startup BitInstant shut down amid regulatory concerns. Intellisys Capital, he said, now intends to issue tokens representing blockchain-based shares in manufacturing, real estate or even sanitary waste firms that are profitable and low risk. Shrem told the audience: Blockchain will be used to administer and decentralize the fund, he added. As explained in a press release, the fund will be called Mainstreet Investment LP, and 30% will be owned by token holders and a controlling stake. The remaining 70% will, in turn, be owned by Intellisys Capital. Using this strategy, Intellisys Capital hopes to begin generating dividends, which it will then issue to token holders and invest in blockchain technology companies to build a portfolio. (Shrem cited this ability as a key reason Intellisys is using the ethereum platform). ""The strategy is designed to create symbiosis between blockchain assets and traditional finance and to help many traditional sectors move toward state-of-the-art improvements and efficiencies,"" a press release said. Expected to launch in the next few months, Intellisys will raise funds through the sale of an ethereum-based token called 'mainstreet investment token', slated to be sold starting 15th January, 2017. The sale will only be open to both global investors and accredited US investors. Elsewhere, Shrem discussed his life after prison, as well as his perceptions on current industry events and issues with Cooley LLP blockchain lead and industry legal veteran Marco Santori. Overall, Shrem was positive about both the bitcoin and blockchain industry and the new venture, adding: For more of Shrem's talk, watch the full stream of the inaugural CoinDesk On Tap event below.  Correction: A previous version of this article stated the crowdsale would not be open to US investors. This has been corrected.

Data shows that, as of today, 10,053,518 wallets have been created by users of the service. That’s 7m more than Blockchain reported in February of last year, a significant jump in the roughly 20 months since that time. The service reported just under 9.4m wallets late last month. Announcing the 10 millionth wallet on its blog, Blockchain cited factors such as the US presidential election, the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and the vote by the UK to leave the European Union as key drivers of interest in bitcoin. The company said of the milestone: Earlier this month, Blockchain said that it was working with payments startup Coinify to create a new in-wallet bitcoin buying option. Currently in beta, the option is expected to see a wider European release in the weeks ahead, followed by a global rollout sometime next year. Blockchain has raised $30m in venture funding to date from a single Series A round in 2014. Image via Shutterstock

Belize’s Office of the International Financial Services Commission has said that Xmaxbit, a website claiming to offer cryptocurrency investment and mining services, is not officially registered in the country. A registration document posted on its website is “a complete forgery”, according to the agency. The Belize government noted: The agency said that website visitors should “take note and exercise extreme caution” in light of the alleged forgery. Belize isn’t the only country to accuse Xmaxbit of fraud. Earlier this month, the Seychelles Financial Services Authority issued a similar warning about the site, stating that Xmaxbit was fraudulently claiming that it was registered in the Seychelles. “Members of the public are therefore strongly advised to exercise extreme caution when dealing with Xmaxbit,” the regulator said. An request for comment sent to an email address posted on the Xmaxbit website was not immediately returned. Image via Shutterstock

The Agriculture Committee of the US House of Representatives sent a letter to CFTC chair Timothy Massad in the wake of the election of Republican Donald Trump, who defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the presidential vote earlier this month. The committee's letter expressed concern about so-called midnight rulemaking, or a situation in which an outgoing administration uses its remaining time in office to put new regulations in place. Committee chair Mike Conaway, a Republican from Texas, called on the CFTC to avoid pursuing “controversial regulations” in the final months of Obama’s term. Instead, the agency should focus on its role as a market watchdog and pursue other kinds of “day-to-day work” including enforcement actions, Conaway wrote. Conaway went on to suggest that the CFTC could also prioritize initiatives like the regulation of digital currencies before the Trump administration takes over, writing: The CFTC moved in September 2015 to formally declare that it would regulate bitcoin as a kind of commodity. The pronouncement came as the agency announced that it was settling charges against bitcoin options platform Coinflip. “Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are encompassed in the definition and properly defined as commodities,"" the agency said at the time. The agency has also held public hearings on blockchain, and senior officials like Commissioner J Christopher Giancarlo have pushed for the CFTC to adopt a more accommodative stance toward the technology.

The Australian Accounting Standards Board (AASB), a government agency tasked with overseeing the country’s reporting standards, has published a new position paper ahead of a December meeting of members from the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). In sum, the paper argues that a more defined standard is needed both for digital currencies as well as other kinds of intangible assets. The question of accounting standards has come up in the past, but the AASB’s paper might be one of the more consequential to date. Its release comes amid a controversial move by the Internal Revenue Service, the top US tax agency, to seek user records from digital currency exchange Coinbase. According to the AASB paper, “clear” guidance is needed by accountants working with individuals or companies that handle digital currencies. The paper’s author, Deloitte director Henri Venter, wrote: Yet such a move would only solve part of the problem, the paper goes on to argue. At the heart of the issue is that there is a deeper lack of standards for so-called “intangible assets”, which would include digital currencies. “...there is no accounting standard that deals with investments in intangible assets or other commodity type assets that are not financial instruments or inventory,” the paper notes. “Consequently, we recommend that the IASB develop a standard that would address the accounting for investments in intangible assets and commodities."" The Accounting Standards Advisory Forum, a body within the IASB, is set to meet on 8th and 9th December in London. According to documents published by the IASB, members will offer their takes on possible paths to creating standards for digital currencies.

                            How South Africa's 'Shark Tank' Saw its First Bitcoin Investment                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/south-africas-shark-tank-saw-first-bitcoin-investment/," In what could be a world's first, bitcoin made an appearance on the popular TV series Shark Tank this week. Launched in October, South African audiences now have their own version of the popular TV franchise (in which entrepreneurs with a business idea pitch to a panel of investors, aka the 'sharks’). But while bitcoin may not seem like an obvious fit, a notable investor in the technology is giving it small-screen visibility. For the first season, one of the four sharks is Vinny Lingham, a South Africa entrepreneur known for a string of companies including Gyft, Yola and now blockchain startup Civic. He also happens to be one of the most vocal supporters of bitcoin, having incorporated it into past products. In the most recent episode, Lingham brought bitcoin to the fore by offering his investment to the developers of augmented reality game Augmentors in bitcoin. In the clip, made available online by television network M-Net, Lingham tells the Augmentors founders: ""The problem you’re trying to solve around creating rarity … can better be solved by using the bitcoin blockchain. So, my offer will be 500,000 ZAR, or roughly 59 bitcoins, for 20% of your business."" In interview, Lingham explained he was given confidence in his investment by the success of games like Spells of Genesis, a trading card game that integrates a blockchain-based token. Lingham told CoinDesk: Games like Augmentors and others represent a first foray into the use of cryptocurrency tokens for gaming, but augmented reality games may prove to be an ideal place, he said, for this blurring of the lines between in-game and real-world value. In short, Lingham proposed that blockchain be used as a new solution to the problems the entrepreneurs were trying to solve – generating scarcity and uniqueness in a digital environment. Initially, the idea for Augmentors was that game characters would be summoned by real-world items, metallic ""triggers"" that would be sold to players in order to generate revenue. But under the new system, the company will raise funds by selling 'databits', an in-game cryptocurrency that also makes use of the Counterparty token system and that players will be able to buy items and abilities for their characters. It was a quick change of direction, but one which the team behind the game seem to have taken in their stride. ""After Shark Tank, Vinny threw us in at the deep end and basically told us to figure it out,"" said Michael Joubert, creator of the Augmentors game and lead developer on the project. Notably, Joubert's comments point to how difficult it remains to use blockchain technology, even for the highly technical. A self-taught developer, Joubert built the initial prototype of the game single-handedly, before showing it to Kyle Haffenden, a friend from high school who went on to become a co-founder and current managing director of the company. Still, he said it took about a month for them to figure out how Counterparty could be used in the token sale. ""It was a bit of a learning curve, but at the end of the day it was straightforward to do it,"" Joubert said. Since adapting its platform for blockchain, Haffenden said the Augmentors have developed a good relationship with other game companies working in a similar space. ""We been chatting with Spells of Genesis, Book of Orbs; all of the other Counterparty games have been in touch,"" Haffenden said. ""We've been listening to what they're doing, explaining what we're doing – you could say that there's a lot of interest between us."" At present, no date for the initial crowdsale of tokens has been announced, but by Joubert's estimate, a full launch is likely to be a year to 18 months from completion of the sale. In the meantime, some character art for the game is already online, along with some backstory for the game world. Images via M-Net

                            Bitcoin Breaches $750 But Struggles to Set New 2016 High                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-breaches-750-struggles-set-new-2016-high/,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets. This piece covers the period from 11th to 18th November.  The price of bitcoin surpassed $750 this week as it continued to near its 2016 high set back in June. The digital currency rose to as much as $752.04 on 17th November, before falling back, according to CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index (BPI) data. Bitcoin prices then proceeded to fluctuate over the course of the week, surpassing $750 multiple times, but failing to build support above this level. At the time of report, bitcoin had dipped once again, trading at roughly $745, but even after this decline, bitcoin was trading more than 4% higher for the week. Concerns about further devaluation of the yuan, a decree made by the Indian government to take certain bills out of circulation, and sustained uncertainty about the outcome of a Donald Trump presidency all affected the digital currency. Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, summed up the impact of the Chinese developments nicely. ""In the wake of an ever-devaluing yuan, Chinese residents are seeing their yuan-based savings evaporate based on the whim of a higher authority, the Chinese government,"" he told CoinDesk, adding: Tim Enneking, chairman of cryptocurrency manager EAM, weighed in on how the Indian government’s decision to phase out the two largest rupee bills is also providing bitcoin with tailwinds. Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced 8th November that the 500 and 1,000 rupee notes would be withdrawn from circulation, a move that created long lines of customers looking to exchange their bills. ""Lots of Indians are now buying hard assets: gold, diamonds, watches – and bitcoin,"" said Enneking. This market activity could provide sustained support for bitcoin prices, as Enneking stressed that transitioning to the new bills will take some time. While market observers are pointing to decisions made by the governments of China and India as driving bitcoin price action, no analysis would be complete without considering the potential impact of a Trump presidency. His surprise victory in the US election flew in the face of predictions that came from all corners, including political analysts and pollsters. Zivkovski spoke to how this unexpected event could impact both bitcoin and the economy going forward. ""Many consider bitcoin in this case to be a hedge against the fiat-economic turmoil they believe will occur during his presidency,"" he said. But while traders were largely positive, the price saw notable fluctuations during the week, as bitcoin even surged $30 in one hour at one point. The frenetic nature of the digital currency was illustrated by the BitMEX's 30-day Historical Volatility Index, which reached as much as 38.54% and averaged 36.43% for the week. In contrast, the index did not surpass 35% during any session during the prior seven-day period, additional BitMEX figures reveal. While bitcoin notched some solid gains this week, Enneking wondered how long these elevated price levels would last. ""The real question is are we going to break through $700 going south anytime soon,"" he said. ""I think we will fall back, but I am not sure how much."" Bitcoin was certainly not the only digital currency that experienced notable fluctuations this week, as privacy-oriented cryptocurrency Zcash suffered even more intense gyrations. Zcash, which leverages zero-knowledge proofs to ensure anonymity, has been struggling to find a place in the global markets after enjoying a highly publicized release on 28th October that saw its value surge to more than $2m. However, while the digital currency managed to generate headlines by harnessing bleeding-edge cryptography, its price has plummeted over the last few weeks. After opening at $225.74 on 11th November, ZEC tokens had fallen 69% to $70.60 at the time of report, Poloniex figures reveal. One reason for the drop is that the currency’s supply has been steadily rising since the launch, surging to more than 50,000, according to CoinMarketCap data. ""As Zcash supply continues to increase, and, in parallel, demand continues to decrease (as the initial hype fades and Zcash fails to gain major traction or a large-market use case), basic economics dictate that the medium-term trend for Zcash is a decline,"" Zivkovski told CoinDesk. While the digital currency may appear to be encountering some challenges, it could simply be that ZEC tokens were pushed to highly inflated prices and simply need to come back down to a more realistic level. Cryptocurrency trader Jacob Eliosoff pointed out the sharp difference between the price of ZEC on Poloniex and the price of BitMEX futures. At the time of report, the digital currency was trading at 0.099 XBT on the former exchange, more than 70% higher than the price on the latter. Eliosoff told CoinDesk that until the two have similar prices, he believes Zcash will simply be a bad buy. Sky ladder image via Shutterstock

Nick Sullivan took to Reddit today to announce the closure. He said that the tipping service will be officially turned off at the end of November, though its website will remain open “for a number of months” in order to allow for user withdrawals. The closure comes less than two years after the startup, once a popular tool for sending bitcoin tips via social media, raised $3.5m in a seed funding round. ChangeTip sought to bring bitcoin tipping to popular Web platforms like Twitch and Facebook. ChangeTip had attempted to sell the remaining assets and code tied to its tipping service but struggled to do so in the months following Airbnb’s acqui-hire. Those hires took place in April. In today’s post, Sullivan confirmed the struggles to find a future for the service, adding that the cost of continued operation played a role in the decision. Sullivan wrote: Sullivan said that withdrawals would be processed every 24 hours or so, before going on to the service’s users for their commitment over the years. “It was a great adventure, and we’re proud of what we built – we sincerely hope you enjoyed using ChangeTip,” he wrote.

The targets of the investigation are not directly named, but are rather referred to as a group of ""John Does"" who are believed to have avoided or failed to have paid taxes on transactions involving digital currencies. Now, it seems, the IRS is looking to more aggressively police digital currency users in the US, and the investigation itself focuses on taxpayers who transacted between 2013 and 2015. Attorneys for the US government wrote: The court action comes more than two years after the IRS declared that it would regulate bitcoin and other digital currencies as kinds of property subject to tax and reporting requirements. Yet, in the years that followed, the IRS has reportedly failed to create a comprehensive strategy around the tech, according to a recent inspector general report. That report blasted the IRS, arguing that the agency's shortcomings have heightened tax avoidance risks. In the meantime, tax professionals in the US have attacked the agency’s approach as too vague and in need of improvement. As of press time, Coinbase has said that it is weighing the filing and that it is seeking to respond in a way that maintains user privacy. ""We take user privacy very seriously and will work to protect the privacy of our users in broad information requests,"" Coinbase representative David Farmer said. ""We are taking a very careful look at this petition and the scope of the government's authority as it relates to this request."" A representative for the IRS did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the petition does not point any fingers at potential tax cheats, some of the filings from the IRS offer examples of the kinds of investigations the agency has conducted to date. A statement from IRS agent David Utzke outlines three instances in which the target of an investigation had ultimately confessed to using digital currency in a bid to avoid scrutiny. He wrote about one individual who, after using offshore accounts for years to maintain their funds, started using the tech to move their money. Utzke wrote: Two other cases involved ""corporate entities with annual revenues of several million dollars"", each of which involved the use of a Coinbase account. ""Both taxpayers admitted disguising the amount they spent purchasing the bitcoins as deductions for technology expenses on their tax returns,"" Utzke wrote. ""The bitcoin transactions were discovered after repeated requests for the original documentation necessary to substantiate the technology expense items claimed on the tax returns.""

Following block 439,488 on the bitcoin blockchain (which occurred at roughly 8:30 UTC today), miners can now upgrade their software by changing a header value in the blocks that they process. Called Segregated Witness (SegWit), the change is best known as a way to scale transactions on the bitcoin blockchain by carving out more space in each block, though it also solves a long-known major bug and expands the software in a few other notable ways. As coded in the latest bitcoin software release (0.13.1), 95% of miners need to signal support for the change in a series of 2016 blocks, or a period of roughly two weeks. If that happens, there will be another two week period before SegWit is officially activated. If activated, the change would ripple out to the rest of the ecosystem of wallets and software projects, and users on the network could begin to take advantage of the update. But not everyone supports the change (one observer even called the signaling period the beginnings of a ""dirty war""). With miners ViaBTC and Bitcoin.com reaffirming their intent to block the update in recent statements, their combined hashing power (roughly 8%), means there's chance the threshold won't be reached. On the other hand, other mining pools have shown eagerness to make the upgrade, with Slush signaling support for the change early (despite the alleged dangers of doing so) and BTCC indicating that its mining pool is ""ready"" for SegWit. Others may not be technically prepared to make the change quite yet. F2Pool said in an email that the mining pool cannot signal support in the ""near future"" because their system isn't upgraded to the correct version of the programming language C++. Bitcoin Core, the volunteer group behind the most popular bitcoin software, released a graph that shows the total, estimated hashrate flagging support of SegWit at any given time (as indicated by the red line). According to the coded rules, miners have one year to reach the near-unanimous threshold before the change times out. Green light image via Shutterstock

The Financial Services Commission convened the first meeting of its new task force this week, and the agency is planning additional hearings over the next few months. Other government bodies represented on the task force include the the Ministry of Strategy and Finance and the Financial Supervisory Service. The Bank of Korea, the country’s central bank, is also involved in the initiative. Up for discussion, the FSC said, is which approach to take, citing examples like New York’s BitLicense and Japan’s recent regulatory moves as possible models. The European Union's work on regulation was also mentioned as a possible starting point. In a translated announcement release, the agency cited “regulatory blind spots” as drivers for action, as well as money laundering and tax evasion risks. The move comes as South Korea’s financial system has pursued varied applications of blockchain, particularly in the area of remittances. In October, bitcoin startup Coinplug said that it was working with South Korea’s largest credit card company on a new identity solution that leverages the tech. The country’s sole securities exchange announced this week that it would open a private blockchain-based market. Image via Shutterstock

At press time, bitcoin prices were up 2% on the day's trading, and up $50 since the start of Monday's trading at 0:00 UTC. Propelled by a sharp uptick earlier this week (in which the price spiked $30 in just one hour), the price of bitcoin is now nearing the 2016 highs it set in early June. According to data from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI), bitcoin is now trading at its highest mark since 20th June, when anticipation for bitcoin's decline in mining rewards was arguably at its peak. In this case, however, the uptick may not be attributable to just one factor. Bitcoin has been enjoying continually bullish sentiment among avid traders in past months, and there are increasing signs that its recent gains may have been sparked by exterior market forces. For example, India has recently seen a ban on certain denominations of banknotes, a development that local bitcoin startups claim has bolstered business, though websites with public data (such as LocalBitcoins) indicate the effects are perhaps less clear. At press time, the price of 1 BTC on India-based exchange Unocoin was 61,688 India rupees, or more than $900, a figure that boosts claims of strong local demand. Other factors boosting the price could be the devaluation of China's yuan, which has suffered daily declines this week. Also a possibility is a general warming sentiment about key technical improvements to the network, with code that could scale the bitcoin blockchain expected to roll out before the end of the year, potentially muting long-held concerns about transaction capacity.

ViaBTC founder Haipo Yang took questions during an Ask Me Anything (AMA) session on the r/btc subreddit, commenting on the block size debate. The event saw strong advocacy for Bitcoin Unlimited, a bitcoin software implementation that has been proposed as an alternative to Bitcoin Core, the primary user client for the bitcoin network. ViaBTC was launched in June of this year (and quickly emerged as controversial). The AMA session came amid the ongoing rollout of Segregated Witness, a change to bitcoin's code aimed at increasing the amount of transactions the network can handle without adjusting the block size. Yet the upgrade has proven to be a controversial one among some bitcoin users, who have argued that an increase in the block size – or a variable size with Unlimited – is the better approach. Yang claimed in the session that, as it stands, China’s mining community wants a bigger block size, but isn't unified in its support for Unlimited specifically. He wrote: Elsewhere, Yang framed the current debate as ""a battle about Bitcoin’s future path"", invoking bitcoin’s pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto and arguing that Unlimited's approach is more in line with the initial vision of the digital currency. While the thread largely drew supporters, critics emerged. One notable inclusion was Blockstream CEO Adam Back, who wrote that Unlimited ""is non-functional"" and ""little tested"", among other critiques. ""I’ve already clearly stated my view: the protocol is more important than the code,"" Yang wrote in response. ""We've been running Bitcoin Unlimited for more than a month with no problems."" The push for bigger blocks within China's mining community was also on display during a recent event hosted by bitcoin mining firm Bitmain. This development has largely continued despite the protests of Bitcoin Core and its supporters, who maintain alternatives would be dangerous if more widely used. Image via Shutterstock

Government officials from both local and national-level jurisdictions are expected to attend. Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi, secretary general for the Supreme Legislation Committee, said of the event: That Dubai would at least begin putting the pieces in place to create comprehensive legislation around bitcoin is perhaps unsurprising. Since the start of this year, its government has aggressively pursued research into the technology, partnering with regional bitcoin startups like BitOasis. Those early steps had developed into proofs-of-concept by the spring, including plans to use blockchain to back up government documents and create connected device networks. For now, Dubai’s legislative body appears to be in a learn-and-see stage. In statements, Al Muhairi argued that the venue would provide an opportunity for members of Dubai’s government to gain a better understanding of the tech. “This will acquaint them with the ways international law deals with ‘bitcoin’, which is now officially recognized worldwide due to the accelerated pace of the smart transformation,” he said.

                            Bitcoin's Lightning Network is Now Digital Asset Compatible                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-lightning-network-now-digital-asset-compatible/," With Bitcoin's Lightning Network nearing launch, the number of tests seeking to upgrade the micropayments network is on the rise. Now, industry startup Colu has unveiled a demo of how Lightning could be made compatible with colored coins (a technology that enables small amounts of bitcoin to represent other assets, such as the US dollar, stocks, or even houses or cars). Mashing this concept together with Lightning could mean more of these transfers at a higher speed. Users can now send test transactions over the so-called ""off-chain"" network using Colu's demo, which perhaps offers the first user-experience for a Lightning Network project. The team worked with the startup Lightning Labs, tweaking its existing code to make it compatible with colored coins. But are near-limitless transfers of mortgage records really necessary? Colu co-founder and VP blockchain Mark Smargon said that he thinks that this functionality could help solve one of colored coins' bigger problems, while conceding that it might not be necessary for every use case. He told CoinDesk: He argues that the low-hanging fruit for this functionality is local currencies, a use case that has become a big focus for Colu, which raised nearly $10m earlier this year in its bid to narrow its focus from colored coins more broadly. A couple of years ago, we saw the peak of debate over the size of a field in bitcoin's code (called OP_RETURN) that companies and developers use to store extra data on the blockchain for use cases such as colored coins. Another small tweak to the protocol, it emerged as a contentious idea because of the possibility that it could ""bloat"" the blockchain in a way that harms overall scalability. Since all volunteers that are running bitcoin nodes need to store the extra data, the argument was that transactions that weren't peer-to-peer digital currency exchanges were perhaps unwanted freeriders. But as Smargon suggested, making colored coins compatible with a platform that grows the network from roughly three transactions per second to millions of transactions that occur off-chain could mitigate the issue. The demo shows how users might see this process. Once you click the page, a new Lightning account is automatically created (the random string of numbers that it calls your ""Lightning ID""), and it starts the user off with fake money ($5,000) that he or she can transfer over Colu's colored coins-compatible test version of the Lightning Network.  This is a demonstration of how the bitcoin in your account can represent US dollars with the help of the OP_RETURN field that adds more information about what the bitcoin are ""colored"" to represent. Smargon explained how channels can be updated using the same pattern that Lightning Network already uses. Once a ""colored"" transaction with OP_RETURN is initiated to open a channel, the channel parties can update the value back and forth off-chain. When it comes time to settle on the blockchain, the OP_RETURN data will reflect the finalized balances. Behind the scenes, the demo runs over ""simnet,"" a simulated private bitcoin network run by Colu. Smargon said that it would work much the same on the bitcoin testnet and that it's ready to go on the real bitcoin network, at least, if and when a feature known as Segregated Witness is triggered on the main bitcoin network that will the enable Lightning Network. (Miners can begin signaling their support for the feature once a certain number of blocks have been added — probably as soon as 18th November). For now, the demo's a taste of what the network might look like once it’s ready for users.

The sudden boost followed a relatively slow uptick over the course of recent trading sessions, with the price fluctuating between $706 and $713 from 0:00 UTC on 15th November to 12:00 UTC today, figures from the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index reveal. However, that would soon change as the price began rising quickly, spiking nearly 4% over the course of just 60 minutes today. Speculation on social media credited the boost to a weakening of China's yuan, a theory that is supported by the fact that China-based bitcoin exchanges continue to account for the lion's share of trading, but that perhaps lacks credible anecdotal evidence. Equally possible is that the uptick was driven by low liquidity in the bitcoin economy and sudden surge in demand. As profiled in CoinDesk, experts believe a number of recent price spikes could have been caused by single traders due to a lack of market depth. At press time, a representative of the bitcoin trading community Whale Club suggested rumors of a 500,000 BTC order at an exchange may have caused the uptick. Jump rope image via Shutterstock

                            With Vulcan Project, PwC Wants Banks to Rethink Bitcoin                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/digital-asset-service-pwc-vulcan-bitcoin/," Digital currencies may have launched the blockchain conversation, but it's no secret that they've taken a backseat amid rising interest in distributed ledgers. Now, with the help of 'Big Four' audit firm PwC's Australia division, a trio of startups are making a play aimed squarely at altering this narrative by convincing financial institutions that bitcoin (and the open network of digital currencies that has sprung up around it) could help them launch new services and better serve existing customers. Called Vulcan Digital Asset Services, the platform (a joint effort by Bloq, Libra, Netki and PwC), aims to enable the professional services firm's clients to launch digital assets that would be interoperable with and trade alongside bitcoin and its many alternatives. In interview, Vulcan lead and PwC Australia blockchain leader Robert Allen explained that the initiative grew out of a bid to make bitcoin more accessible to large institutions. Allen told CoinDesk: Allen explained that a retailer could use Vulcan to issue its own rewards points that could be traded for bitcoin or other digital assets. PwC's platform would then take care of providing the supporting blockchain infrastructure, enabling clients to create wallets, process payments and, maybe soon, launch merchant services. In this light, Allen framed PwC's effort as one that would allow clients to meet compliance needs while still leveraging the open-source blockchain ecosystem, but in a way where the digital currency network would only be run by authorized participants. Libra's Jeremy Drane, a former FinTech lead at PwC, called Vulcan a ""huge"" step in uniting the now divided blockchain and digital currency ecosystems. ""This stack eliminates the argument that banks cannot allow consumers to buy, sell and use bitcoin, and other types of cryptocurrencies due to technical limitations and the implications on related regulatory schemes,"" he told CoinDesk. Though driven by PwC Australia, Allen said that Vulcan is rather a product of feedback from the firm's entire ""global network"", and that it could one day launch as a subscription service. So, what is a digital asset service under the hood? As explained by Bloq co-founder Matt Roszak, the new offering isn't all that dissimilar from offerings by so-called ""blockchain startups"", in that users could create a new blockchain and then link it to another public blockchain (like bitcoin). But Roszak contends Vulcan is best considered as an ""enablement platform"" that would provide businesses with a ""plug and play"" way to launch digital currencies (rather than their own standalone blockchains). This goal is perhaps not a surprise as Vulcan was built by Bloq, a startup that seeks to help enterprises feel more confident in using the bitcoin blockchain. For the effort, Allen said that Bloq had created the tools for its clients to launch a ""multi-asset blockchain"" that would enable users to issue digital assets. On top, would be identity and compliance services provided by Netki and Libra. Roszak said Vulcan is already in talks with one central bank to use the service and that a key advantage to the platform is that it would include many of the features needed for a US dollar coin or a UK pound coin out of the gate. Long term, Allen foresees Vulcan potentially even offering wallet services to users who would hold ""multiple types of fiat and cryptocurrency."" ""We don't see this as being counter to the principle of cryptocurrency, but taking it to a wider customer base. We have the ability within professional services to educate the regulators, the corporates and the wider population on the benefits of digital currencies,"" he added. According to Allen, the launch represents the culmination of more than two years of work in the space for PwC and his division. But while the result may be unconventional by today's industry standards, Allen said that he believes PwC has removed real hurdles by bundling its services creatively and leveraging its existing brand recognition. For example, Allen said PwC has already made inroads in Australia, where he asserted that his firm has had a positive dialogue with regulators, one that has successfully assuaged concerns regarding consumer protection and compliance. Yet, Allen reported that the learning curve remains steep, and that more progress needs to be made before the service (or those like it) will be widely adopted. ""There's a lot of education and some of the clients are resistant for obvious reasons, and those have affected the uptake and adoption and digital currencies in the wider sense,"" Allen continued. ""We use our relationships with those clients to try to understand where the resistance is, and overcome it with what we have, the facts."" In his remarks, Allen offered praise for bitcoin, arguing that it has shown that digital currencies can offer ""huge utility"" as well as a working model for enterprises to follow in launching similar networks. ""In terms of a digital currency, bitcoin's pretty much the only game in town,"" Allen said. But while a development that could open more enterprise institutions to public blockchain, the initiative is just entering its first stages. Allen indicated that the platform is currently operational as a proof-of-concept, and that it will be unveiled at the Singapore FinTech Festival this week. ""We're using the event as the launchpad to come out of stealth and tell the world what we're doing,"" Allen said. Allen expects that the announcement will help drive interest and bring more firms to the platform, with a potential for more announcements later next year as various projects mature.

Revealed today, Gemini users are now able to connect to the New York-based bitcoin and ether exchange via a REST API, WebSockets API and a FIX API, upgrades that bring more widely used electronic communications protocols to the platform. In statements, representatives from Gemini said that the updates would make private order status information more readily accessible to traders. The exchange wrote: Notably, Gemini said the service was inspired by feedback from Whale Club, the popular network for bitcoin day traders, a move that may suggest a shift in strategy at the exchange. Launched late last year by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, Gemini has arguably struggled to attract users from this community, in part due to its original positioning as a service for enterprise institutions and its lack of offerings for more active traders. However, that market may be becoming more important now that Gemini's initial target audience has proved somewhat elusive. Data from Bitcoinity indicates Gemini lags behind the two most popular regulated US dollar bitcoin exchanges, Coinbase's GDAX and Paxos' itBit. Over the last seven days, Gemini has traded 13,913 BTC (nearly $10m), while GDAX saw 40,455 BTC in volume (roughly $28.5m) during the time period. Trading terminal image via Shutterstock

                            Will Bitcoin Have its Moment in the Trump Era?                        ",Michael J Casey,https://www.coindesk.com/will-bitcoin-have-its-moment-in-the-trump-era/,"Michael J Casey works on blockchain-based solutions for the Digital Currency Initiative at the MIT Media Lab. He is also a former Wall Street Journal reporter, and the author of several books including ""The Age of Cryptocurrency"", which he authored with Paul Vigna. Here, Casey examines how bitcoin might fare under the an administration soon to be overseen by noted, and controversial, entrepreneur Donald Trump.  History tells us that no international monetary system lasts forever. And as Barry Eichengreen, the leading thinker in this arena, has repeatedly reminded us, those systems tend to collapse very quickly, whether it was the dominance of Rome’s coins, the British pound’s status as the common unit of international trade, or the various periods in which the world aligned around the gold standard. The same will be true for the US dollar’s unofficial status as the international reserve currency. Its hegemony will at some point disappear and, when it does, the fall will be swift as the world scrambles for a new commercial anchor. Below, I will make the case that the trigger for this decline, whether it happens in the next four years or not, could well have been put in place last Tuesday. A Trump presidency could hold the right ingredients for a US dollar collapse. I will also argue that this time, when the dollar system collapses, it won’t be replaced by another outdated fiat currency like the euro, yen or Chinese yuan. Neither will we go back to a precious metals standard, however much gold bugs hanker for it. In the interim, we may anchor world trade to a transitional, multilateral combination of these paper and commodity currencies, but soon enough it will prove to be too unwieldy and out of touch with a changing global economy. The fact is, we now operate in a digital economy in which economic activity is increasingly decentralized, with transactions happening peer-to-peer and, when the Internet of Things is in place, machine-to-machine. That online, decentralized economic architecture will require a digital, decentralized system of monetary exchange that bypasses the inefficient financial intermediaries of a broken banking system. The solution might not be bitcoin per se, but the distributed, network-run system of value transfer that it represents will, I believe, provide the template for the future model. It's one possible explanation for why the digital currency got a bump on Tuesday evening through Wednesday. Why might Trump set this chain of events in play? To be sure, we don’t know what changes the next president will introduce, but he has definitely stoked uncertainty around the direction of US policy. And uncertainty, the enemy of efficient markets, can often have a self-fulfilling effect. That’s an unsatisfying answer, however. So let’s also break down some of the ideas that Trump has floated and how they might change the international perception of America’s commitment to the dollar-based international system: Rights determined by ethnic background Trump suggests we should discriminate against external foreigners (Muslim visitors to the US), domestic non-citizens (undocumented Hispanic immigrants) and domestic citizens (judges deemed unfit to serve for being of Mexican descent.) This is not just a moral issue; it goes to the heart of whether the law is impartially upheld in the US. That perceived impartiality is critical to foreign investors’ willingness to hold dollar assets. Might a Trump presidency call into question the vital notion that anyone can assert their contractual property rights in the US, regardless of who and where they are? If so, might it tip those investors toward repatriating some of the trillions of dollars they hold in US assets and which underpin the dollar’s reserve status? Contempt for international treaties Whether it’s Trump’s aggressively anti-free trade stance (vs Mexico and vs China) or his disregard for NATO and other international security pacts, the president-elect does not hold existing international agreements in high regard. Yet the US’s commitment to them is integral to the dollar’s role as the monetary rails of international trade. It also seems possible that this isolationist mindset would lead the US to cut off support for the Bretton Woods institutions, the IMF and the World Bank, two cornerstones of the current international financial system that have already been squeezed by funding constraints from a Republican-led Congress. Foreign governments trust the US to hold their reserves under an implicit understanding that Washington will stand by these key elements of the international framework for cross-border exchanges and commitments. Ambiguous commitment to US security umbrellas Trump’s dismissal of NATO, his apparent cuddling up to Russia, and his seemingly more lax approach to nuclear proliferation hint at a dramatic diminishment of the US’s military deployment around the world. That security structure is fundamental to the dollar’s strength – there is an implicit quid pro quo in the idea that in return for Washington’s expenditure on ships, planes and personnel that protect the world’s trade routes, the world uses dollars to transact along those routes. Mistrust in the Federal Reserve Trump’s explicit criticism of Janet Yellen during the campaign, saying she should be “ashamed” of keeping interest rates low, challenges the independence of the most important institution charged with upholding the value of the dollar. What might that do to foreign investor confidence? Runaway federal deficits The Committee for a Responsible Federal Government estimated that Trump’s campaign spending proposals would add a staggering $5.3 trillion dollars to America’s debt load over the next 10 years, 25 times that of Hillary Clinton’s proposal. If even half of that were to be committed, the government would have two options: default on the debt or use inflation to monetize it. Either way, the result would be a massive devaluation in the dollar akin to that which President Nixon achieved when he abandoned its gold peg in 1971. Speaking of the “Nixon shock,” it’s worth remembering that it was achieved through executive fiat, with the audacious plan privy to only a very small clique of close-knit presidential advisors. It provides a valuable reminder of the power of a strong-minded president to singlehandedly change the international monetary system. I’m not saying Trump would willingly take such action, but these are the kinds of historical reference points that foreign investors will keep in the back of their minds as they weigh their bets on the dollar. As for what comes next, it’s worth considering how reluctantly many governments participate in the current dollar-based bargain. It’s no secret that China would love to be less dependent on the dollar for foreign trade, which in turn would mean that it isn’t trapped by a need to hold more than $1 trillion in national savings in US Treasury bonds. But there are also smaller-country governments that feel completely vulnerable to the dollar system, since it means that any change in US interest rates can have a destabilizing effect on their economies. The situation effectively robs them of monetary autonomy. What’s interesting is that new, digital money solutions inspired by, if not based on, bitcoin could help these countries wean themselves off the dollar. The digital ledger technology that Wall Street banks are using to pursue the real-time settlement of securities transfers could equally be used to achieve real-time settlement of trade flows. If Chinese exporters can now get direct rubles-to-yuan payments from Russian importers, without depending on the US-led international banking system to clear transactions through its cumbersome, time-consuming process of aggregated transfers, those two countries’ payments would no longer need to triangulate through dollars. Meanwhile, in smaller emerging markets, governments are exploring digital money solutions that might also bypass banks and potentially even allow them to create independent monetary policy systems. And what might smart contracts that give both businesses and governments automating tools to mitigate cross-border currency risks do to demand for reserve currencies? The only reason to hold reserves, which amounts to deferring money that could be put to use back home, is for insurance against those risks. To me, these changes in the technology of money, along with other aspects of our increasingly digitalizing and decentralizing global economy  –  everything from machine-learning and augmented reality to drone delivery and 3D printing  –  make it unlikely that the post-dollar, international solution for managing value exchange will be another fiat currency-based regime. The new architecture will come from within the decentralizing digital technologies themselves. I’m under no illusions that the powers-that-be who will help determine this future will necessarily gravitate toward bitcoin. But right now, there aren’t many other ways to hedge for these kinds of changes. Bitcoin is the only bellwether we have — a proxy asset class — for the prospect of a future financial system based on a decentralized, distributed trust network. So if, you’re worried and/or excited about the disruption that a Trump presidency could do to the global monetary system  –  I’m both, I suppose  –  bitcoin might just be a creative way to bet on whatever emerges next.

                            Bitcoin's Security Model: A Deep Dive                        ",Jameson Lopp,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-security-model-deep-dive/," When discussing consensus mechanisms for different cryptocurrencies, one issue that often causes arguments is a lack of understanding (and definition) of the security model that they provide for the historical data in the ledger. While each consensus model aims to prevent various theoretical attacks, it’s important to understand the goals for the model. Every security model has two main parts: assumptions and guarantees. If the assumptions used as inputs hold true, then so should the guarantees that are output by the model. Let’s dig into the security model that appears to be offered to bitcoin users who run a full node. The goal of distributed ledgers is to provide an ordered history of events, because in distributed systems you can’t simply trust a timestamp. When a new participant on a blockchain-based network joins, they download any available blocks and consider every valid series of blocks that they see, starting from a hard-coded genesis block. One of the greatest assumptions made by bitcoin’s security model is that the majority of miners are honest – that they are working to secure the blockchain rather than attempting to undermine it. In practice, this has held true throughout bitcoin’s history due to miner incentives, though some question if it will continue to hold true in the future. Given this assumption, full node operators can be completely sure of several facts: Full node operators can be reasonably sure of several other things. There is a strong guarantee that: At a more technical level, this requires a multitude of checks: Once a transaction is confirmed in a block it can’t be reversed without someone expending a minimum amount of energy to rewrite the chain. As long as no attacker holds more than 50% of the network’s computational power, and honest nodes can communicate quickly, the probability of a transaction being reversed decreases exponentially with the number of confirmations it has received. There are other attacks, such as selfish mining, that can reduce this power requirement, though they appear to be difficult to perpetrate. Looking at the current cumulative work performed by bitcoin miners, it would take nearly 1026 hashes to build an alternative blockchain from genesis with greater cumulative proof of work that full nodes would consider to be the “true” chain. To crunch some numbers on the cost involved in such an attack:
An Antminer S9 runs at 0.1 Joule per GH (109 hashes)
 1026 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 1015 joules
 1015 joules = 2,777,777,778 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $277,777,778 worth of electricity to rewrite the entire blockchain Whereas at time of writing a single block must hit a difficulty target of 253,618,246,641 which would require approximately:
 253,618,246,641 * 248 / 65535 = 1.09 * 1021 hashes
 1.09 * 1021 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 1.09 * 1011 joules
 1.09 * 1011 joules = 30,278 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $3,028 worth of electricity per block This is why we can state that bitcoin is provably thermodynamically secure. There are a few variables that you can tweak in the above calculation to decrease the cost, but we can be sure that it will require many millions of dollars worth of electricity alone in order to rewrite the entire blockchain. However, an attacker with this much hash power would at worst be able to reverse transactions back to 2014 – we’ll delve into the reason for this shortly. Also note that this doesn’t take into account the costs required to obtain and operate sufficient mining equipment to carry out such an attack. Because the bitcoin protocol considers the true chain to be the one with the most cumulative proof of work (not the longest chain as is often incorrectly stated,) the result is that a new peer joining the network only needs to connect to a single honest peer in order to find the true chain. This is also known as “Sybil resistance,” which means that it’s not possible for someone to launch an attack against a node by creating many dishonest peers that feed it false information.  Pictured here is a near worst-case scenario in which your node is being massively Sybil attacked but still has a single connection with an honest node that is connected to the true bitcoin network. As long as a single honest peer is passing the true blockchain data to your full node, it will be quite clear that any Sybil attackers are attempting to deceive you and your node will ignore them. The bitcoin protocol creates a number of other interesting attributes with regard to maintaining network-wide consensus once your node is at the tip of the blockchain. The authors of “Research Perspectives and Challenges for Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies” note the following properties that are important to the stability of a cryptocurrency: Eventual consensus. At any time, all compliant nodes agree upon a prefix of what will become the eventual “true” blockchain. Exponential convergence. The probability of a fork of depth n is O(2−n). This gives users high confidence that a simple “k confirmations” rule will ensure their transactions are settled permanently. Liveness. New blocks will continue to be added and valid transactions with appropriate fees will be included in the blockchain within a reasonable amount of time. Correctness. All blocks in the chain with the most cumulative proof of work will only include valid transactions. Fairness. A miner with X% of the network’s total computational power will mine approximately X% of blocks. The authors of the paper note that bitcoin appears to have these properties, at least under the assumption that the majority of miners are remaining honest, which is what the block rewards along with proof of work attempt to incentivize. There are many other algorithms that can be used to maintain consensus in distributed systems such as: These create different security models – the most obvious difference from proof of work being that each of the alternative systems’ consensus is driven at the expense of internal resources (coins or reputation) rather than external resources (electricity.) This creates a very different set of incentives for (and trust in) validators on the network which drastically changes the security model. A common mistaken assumption is that there is a well-defined security model for bitcoin. In reality, the bitcoin protocol was and is being built without a formally defined specification or security model. The best that we can do is to study the incentives and behavior of actors within the system in order to better understand and attempt to describe it. That said, there are a few properties of the bitcoin protocol that are often analyzed incorrectly. Some blockchains have suffered badly enough from attacks that developers add centrally broadcasted signed checkpoints into the node software, essentially saying that “block X has been validated by the developers as being on the correct historical chain.” This is a point of extreme centralization. It’s worth noting that bitcoin has 13 hard-coded checkpoints, but they do not change the security model in the way that broadcasted checkpoints do. The last checkpoint was added to Bitcoin Core 0.9.3 and is at block 295000, which was created on April 9, 2014. This block had a difficulty of 6,119,726,089 which would require approximately: 6,119,726,089 * 248 / 65535 = 2.62 * 1019 hashes
 2.62 * 1019 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 2.62 * 109 joules
 2.62 * 109 joules = 728 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $73 worth of electricity to generate Thus, if a Sybil attacker completely surrounded a new node that was syncing from scratch, it could create some short blockchains at low heights at almost no cost, but only up to the various checkpointed blocks. If it partitioned a node off the network that had synced past block 295,000 it would be able to start feeding false blocks at the cost of $73 per block, at least until it hit a difficulty readjustment. However, the further along the victim node had synced, the greater the cost would be for the attacker to create a chain with more cumulative work. Both Greg Maxwell and Pieter Wuille have stated that they hope to someday completely remove checkpoints. Bitcoin Core lead maintainer Wladimir van der Laan noted that checkpoints are a constant source of confusion to people who seek to understand bitcoin’s security model. An argument could be made that this means a full node is “trusting” the Core devs regarding the validity of the blockchain history up until 9th April, 2014, but the node still checks the Merkle hashes in each block’s header, meaning that the soundness of the transaction history is still secured by proof of work. These old checkpoints enable a performance increase (skipping signature verification) when initially syncing the historical blockchain, though the introduction of libsecp256k1 has made the performance difference less significant. Checkpoints remain in place for three purposes: While this article was being written Greg Maxwell proposed replacing checkpoints with a cumulative work check instead. Once a node has a chain that contains more than 5.4 * 1024 hashes performed, chains with less cumulative work would be rejected. This coincides with the amount of work performed up to approximately block 320,000 in September 2014, at which point individual blocks were of difficulty ~27,000,000,000. Mining blocks at a difficulty of 27,000,000,000 would require approximately
27,000,000,000 * 248 / 65535 = 1.16 * 1020 hashes
1.16 * 1020 hashes * 0.1 J / 109 hashes = 1.16 * 1010 joules
1.16 * 1010 joules = 3,222 kw hours * $0.10 kw/hour = $322 worth of electricity per block Thus, with this proposed change, if a Sybil attacker completely surrounded a new node that was syncing from scratch, it would be able to start feeding false blocks starting at any block after genesis for basically no cost. If a Sybil attacker completely surrounded a node that synced past block ~320,000 it could start feeding a false chain from that point at the cost of $322 per block. In short, either check for securing a node’s initial sync is relatively inexpensive to attack if an entity can gain complete control of your node’s Internet connection; if they can’t, then the node will easily dismiss the attacker’s blocks. On a related note, every blockchain system has its genesis block hard coded into the node software. You could argue that there is a social contract to the “shared history” that is the ledger – once a block is old enough, there is an understanding amongst everyone on the network that it will never be reverted. As such, when developers take a very old block and create a checkpoint out of it, it is done more so as an agreed-upon sanity check rather than as a dictation of history. In addition to checkpoints, there’s also the matter of how a node bootstraps itself. The current process for bitcoin nodes is to check to see if it has a local database of peers it has previously learned about. If not, then it will query a set of “DNS Seeds” that are hard-coded into the software. These seeds maintain a list of well connected bitcoin nodes that they return to your node. As we can see from the code, Bitcoin Core 0.13 currently uses DNS Seeds run by Pieter Wuille, Matt Corallo, Luke Dashjr, Christian Decker, Jeff Garzik, and Jonas Schnelli. Anyone can run a DNS seed by using Pieter Wuille’s bitcoin-seeder software or Matt Corallo’s software, though in order for it to be used by new nodes you’d have to convince the developers of one of the full node implementations to add your DNS seed host to their software. It may once again seem like a point of extreme centralization that the bootstrapping process for a new node is reliant upon a mere six DNS seeds. Recall that bitcoin’s security model only requires that you connect to a single honest peer in order to be able to withstand Sybil attacks. As such, a new node only needs to be able to connect to a single DNS seed that isn’t compromised and returns IP addresses of honest nodes. However, there is a fallback if for some reason all of the DNS seeds are unreachable – a hard-coded list of reliable node IP addresses that gets updated for each release. The security model for these various initialization parameters is not that the full node operator is trusting X DNS seeds or Y Core developers to feed them honest data, but rather that at least 1 / X DNS seeds is not compromised or 1 / Y Core developers is honest about reviewing the validity of hard-coded peer changes. At an even deeper level, when you run a full node, you are probably trusting the hardware and software you are running to a certain extent. There are methods to verify the software by checking the signatures of your binary against those of van der Laan, but it’s unlikely that many people bother to go through this process. As for trustworthy hardware, that’s a tough problem. The closest you’ll probably come to a secure hardware solution is something like ORWL, which guaranteed to “self destruct” if anyone attempts to tamper with it.  However, given that hardware architectures for CPUs, RAM and other important hardware tend to be proprietary, you can never be 100% sure that they aren’t compromised. The waters become even murkier when you begin to investigate the relationship between different participants in the system. The purpose of running a full node is to protect your financial sovereignty. This generally means that by installing and running a specific version of software, you are entering into an agreement that you will abide by the rules of that software and that everyone else using the network must also abide by them. As such, if people want to change the rules in such a way that are not backwards compatible, you must explicitly agree to the rule change by running a new version of the software. On the other hand, backwards compatible rule changes can be implemented and enforced without your consent. A highly simplified description of the power dynamics in bitcoin:  It’s important to note that full node software does not automatically update itself, and this is by design. Automatic updates would greatly shift the balance of power to developers, enabling them to force rule changes upon nodes and miners without their permission. Unfortunately, while a rule change may be technically backwards compatible, we have come to learn over the years that sufficiently creative soft forks can actually implement changes that are clearly outside the intent of the previous version of rules. Vitalik Buterin demonstrated this with a description of a way to soft fork bitcoin’s block time from 10 minutes to 2 minutes, which would of course also speed up the emission schedule of new bitcoins. There is one trump card that full nodes have in order to fight back against unwanted soft forks is to hard fork away from the miners who implemented the soft fork. This is difficult to perform (by design) and raises a lot of questions about measuring consensus and finding the economically important nodes. Technically, it could be done by changing the miner algorithm from double SHA256 to a different hash function, thereby rendering all SHA256 ASICs useless for mining bitcoins. It’s for this reason that node operators should remain vigilant to changes in the ecosystem and remind miners that they can be replaced if they exceed their authority. A lot of game theory is involved in discussing miner operations and their threat to bitcoin’s security, and I speculated as to how the mining ecosystem may change in a previous article. While bitcoin mining is more centralized than most of us would like, it still seems to work well because bitcoin miners have a lot of capital invested – they can’t risk destroying their investment by acting maliciously in a system where everyone is watching. A lot of bitcoin users employ a lightweight client to access the network rather than a full node since it requires far fewer resources while still providing strong security. A client employing Simplified Payment Verification (SPV) downloads a complete copy of the headers for all blocks in the entire chain. This means that the download and storage requirements scale linearly with the amount of time since bitcoin was invented. This is described in section 8 of the bitcoin whitepaper.  Satoshi wrote that an SPV client ""can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it."" SPV assumes that a transaction X blocks deep will be costly to forge. SPV seems to offer similar guarantees as full node security, but with an additional assumption that any block with a valid header and proof of work always contains valid transactions. Because SPV clients don’t check all of the consensus rules noted in the first section of this article, they are making the assumption that the consensus rules are being checked by the node(s) from which they request transactions. An additional, minor security difference involves peers withholding information from you. When you’re running a full node, peers can withhold unconfirmed transactions and blocks from you. However, once you receive a block from any peer, it’s not possible for anyone to withhold the transactions in that block from you. On the flip side, it is possible for a peer to give a block header to an SPV client and then withhold information about transactions in that block. SPV clients can make a query to learn information about transactions affecting a certain address and while it would be costly for peers to lie to them about the existence of fake confirmed transactions (would require mining a block with sufficient PoW) they could lie by omission claim that there were no results for the bloom filter you used to query for transactions. It’s also worth noting that SPV is terribly broken from a privacy standpoint due to flaws with bloom filters. BitcoinJ has an excellent write-up of the SPV security model. Regarding unconfirmed transactions, they note: SPV security is probably “good enough” for the average user, though it could be improved upon with SPV Fraud Proofs. There has been some discussion of this concept but no implemented proposals for building them into the protocol. If you aren’t running a full node (and actually using it to validate transactions) then you’re outsourcing at least some level of trust to third parties, resulting in a different security model for your usage of bitcoin. Note that this need not necessitate that all users and businesses build their software directly on top of Bitcoin Core’s RPC API. Some alternate infrastructure configurations might include but are not limited to: 1) Using a mobile wallet such as Bitcoin Wallet for Android, GreenAddress, or Stash that enables you to configure the wallet to only query your own full node.  2) Building apps on top of SPV node libraries such as BitcoinJ and configuring them to only connect to full nodes that you operate. In BitcoinJ this can be accomplished by defining your own SeedPeers that you pass to your PeerGroup during initialization. With libbitcoin you can define a network connection to a specific node using this example. 3) Building a proxy server that is compatible with Bitcoin Core’s JSON-RPC API that sends some calls to third party services but also automatically verifies the data they return by making calls to a local full node. For an example, see BitGo’s BitGoD software. This hybrid model can give you the best of both worlds: you can leverage advanced features offered by third parties while still retaining your financial sovereignty. It’s clear that running your own full node offers superior security with the fewest required assumptions. Given that you can build a computer capable of running a reliable full node for only a few hundred dollars, do the math and determine if securing your financial sovereignty is worth the price.

                            Bitcoin Tests 2016 Highs as Investors Seek Privacy                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/blockchain-investing-monero-zcash-october-bitcoin-markets/,"Markets Weekly is a column analyzing price movements in the global digital currency markets, and the technology's use case as an asset class. In this special monthly edition, CoinDesk analyzes movements and developments in the digital currency markets for the month of October.  It may seem ironic, but privacy dominated the public digital currency discussion in October. Spurred by a growing awareness that bitcoin is not as anonymous as it has been advertised by banks and regulators, innovators and speculators are now seeking to capitalize on what they see as an opportunity to create new products for developers and new value for investors. Propelling this debate to the forefront was the debut of a long-in-the-making blockchain project called Zcash, which generated significant visibility (not to mention market activity) by leveraging claimed advances in bleeding-edge cryptography. The currency, which uses zero-knowledge proofs called zk-SNARKs to help users verify transactions without exchanging information, has made progress toward providing users with new levels of optional anonymity. As a result of effective outreach, the Zcash markets saw a speedy boom and bust after launch. Zcash's ZEC tokens surged to roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2m) as they started trading on 28th October, Poloniex figures reveal. However, they fell back to below 1 BTC by the 30th.  Amidst this backdrop, market analysts continued to express concerns that the digital currency's early success may be largely based around hype. Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, has not shied away from espousing his view that Zcash is still in its infancy. He emphasized on 3rd November that the digital currency had very little supply, and its market capitalization had only reached a few million dollars (ZEC's market capitalization neared $2.8m at the end of October). But the market didn't just begin to consider Zcash as a privacy-preserving option. Rival cryptocurrency Monero, which harnesses a technology called Ring Signatures to reduce the chances that the two parties in a transaction can be revealed, saw an uptick in attention, if not investment. This month at least, ZEC may have won out, as its 28th October launch generated significant visibility, while XMR, Monero's token, fell more than 35% in October from $7.59 to $4.88, Poloniex figures reveal.  Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff credited this to the significant hype around Zcash's launch. Whether you believed in the technology or not, he argued, it was still a mustn't-miss opportunity for speculators. ""It was predictable that the craze for ZEC might lead to a drop in XMR, since they share many of the same potential buyers,” he told CoinDesk. ""So some of those buyers would have been paying for ZEC by selling some of their XMR, resulting in ZEC up, XMR down."" Eliosoff further stated that these price movements point to a broader trend. ""This is a specific instance of the more general theme that some pairs of cryptocoins are positively correlated, some negatively,"" he said. There was also a sense that the hype was bolstered by the fact that Zcash is backed by some of the digital currency industry's leading investors. Riccardo Spagni, lead developer for Monero, for example, credited this with the loss in value of his project's cryptocurrency. ""ZCash has a small cabal of private investors, many of whom are well-known in the cryptocurrency space, and who were thus responsible for a lot of the hype,"" he told CoinDesk. Elsewhere, no matter which ethereum you prefer, neither was safe for investors this month. Ether (ETH) and classic ether (ETC) both suffered notable losses in October, with ETH/USDT falling 17% to $11.02 and ETC/ETH dropping 14.4% to 0.0809, Poloniex revealed.  The two respective blockchains for these digital currencies, ethereum and ethereum classic, suffered some highly visible technical difficulties. The former experienced a hard fork on 18th October, while the latter underwent the same process one week later. Both were in some ways forced to make the move to address denial of service attacks that had hindered transactions and blocked creation of new tokens. Joe Lee, founder of leveraged derivatives trading platform Magnr, acknowledged that both technologies now suffer from a visibility problem as a result of the issues. ""Confidence in ETH has taken a huge knock since the attack left the network slow and unresponsive for days at a time while fixes were being implemented,"" Lee said. Lee shed further light on the situation, speaking to how the price movements of ETH and ETC were both impacted by these challenges. ""The drop in ETC echoes the drop in ETH as much of the original codebase is still shared. Regardless of the forks, ETC still shares much of the same DNA as ETH, and by virtue of their close relation, the same problems,"" Lee told CoinDesk.  Zivkovski said that both currencies need to overcome current challenges. ""ETH and ETC need to find their purpose and find a way out of the mess (hard forking, hacks, etc) they are currently in,"" he said. ""They also have an image problem (mostly negative), especially after the massive $100m DAO hack."" Perhaps now the less-exciting elder of an increasingly diverse market, bitcoin enjoyed notable gains in October as the spectre of past hacks faded. Bitcoin prices rose close to 15% for the month, according to the CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index, an increase that coincided with robust trading on the China’s exchanges, continued devaluation of the Chinese yuan, and reports that the People’s Bank of China is currently testing systems for monitoring off-balance-sheet wealth management. Three Chinese exchanges – OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC – accounted for more than 98% of the roughly 112 million bitcoins traded in October, Bitcoinity data reveals. Indeed, analysts recognized that trading increasingly depends on trends from Asia.  “During October, trading volumes in bitcoin were primarily led from trading activity based on Chinese exchanges,” said Lee. ""The BTC/CNY currency pair’s trading volume has been higher over the 30-day period during October then the average monthly trading volume of the last six months."" This robust activity took place as the yuan experienced continued declines during the month. It is now on track to suffer its largest monthly drop in more than a year against the dollar as of 28th October. The USD/CNY finished the month up 1.65%, Google Finance data shows. The relationship between bitcoin prices and USD/CNY fits into a broader trend, as the two have roughly followed each other over the last year, according to an ARK Invest analysis of Bloomberg data. Huobi COO Zhu Jiawei cited the devaluation of China’s currency as the single greatest cause of bitcoin's October rally. Many have recognized the digital currency as a store of value following the fluctuations in the yuan's exchange rate, he asserted. As a result, currency fluctuations can have a notable impact on bitcoin prices, said Zhu. Lee provided similar input on the matter, telling CoinDesk: While several market observers emphasized the key role played by currency fluctuations, Ryan Rabaglia, head trader for Octagon Strategies Limited, took a similar tack. He noted that while claims of the yuan's devaluation and it's effect on bitcoin prices are warranted"", adding: Zcash image via Shutterstock

                            What's Left Before Bitcoin's Lightning Network Goes Live                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/whats-left-bitcoins-lightning-network-goes-live/," There aren't many steps left before bitcoin's Lightning Network will be finished – or at least an early version of it. The big picture looked starkly different a year and a half ago when developers Joseph Poon and Tadge Dryja first put forth a white paper outlining a way to expand bitcoin to accommodate millions of transactions per second. It was a cool idea to use hashed timelock contracts (HTLC) to build a top-layer to bitcoin that didn't require any extra trust in intermediaries, but there wasn’t a clear-cut path forward from the theoretical. Since then, it's become viewed as the future of bitcoin transactions, and one of the primary ways to ""Make Bitcoin Great Again,"" or deliver on its original promise for fast, global payments. Today, there are at least eight in-progress implementations of the protocol from around the world, most of which met in Milan, Italy, last month to flesh out a roadmap to ensure that the fragmented projects are able to work with one another. Not to mention, a year ago there were at least two big protocol updates that Lightning hinged on that didn't exist yet. A piece of code called CSV has since been merged into the bitcoin codebase, which allows users to make bitcoin unspendable until a certain time. Now, the developers are just waiting on Segregated Witness, the year-in-the-making code change that is now in sight and that could be triggered by the end of the year. (A couple of mining pools are still threatening to block the change with their combined hashing power). Developers working on the effort say that's the final obstacle that needs to be passed before the first version of the Lightning Network can be deployed, though they admit it won't be a perfect version of the network. Pierre-Marie Padiou, CEO of ACINQ, one startup working on Lightning, told CoinDesk: Lightning creator Joseph Poon also stressed SegWit’s importance as a way to pave the way for the off-chain transaction network. ""The most significant benefit of Segregated Witness isn't about transaction capacity – it's to solve Satoshi's biggest known yet unresolved bug, transaction malleability,"" he said. He went on to explain that while aspects of Lightning are possible without the fix, the technology would be far less secure without it. Although the code change is mainly seen as a scaling solution, it enables half a dozen other things, including an end to transaction malleability, which Poon described as an attack vector that plagues many of bitcoin's more complex contracts. SegWit fixes the problem by changing how transaction data is stored. But even while SegWit is (arguably) uncertain, there's a sense that it could be pretty close to triggering. That's why Lightning developers gathered in Milan for a ""summit"" to sync up about the specifications, said Padiou. The teams are now working to formalize these interoperability specifications since the draft merely roughly describes what each Lightning implementation needs to implement: the wire protocol for sending data, how to encrypt data between nodes, and so on. Once released, the bitcoin community can weigh in on the decisions. That's what developers are working on right now, as well as developing their implementations toward the new standard. Again, the first version will be less than perfect, and might not even support many users. One problem is with the routing – the way of finding a path through the network to whoever you want to make a payment to. The first version will likely use a simpler routing system (like the one put into practice by the startup ACINQ). But this won't scale as well, since each node needs to store the layout of the entire network and doesn't quickly adapt to changes in the network. It's necessary to start there, though, before moving on to a more complicated algorithm. ""Currently, we're interested in seeing how the market dynamics and incentives play out, and the only way to properly model this is to test it out live with real coins,"" Poon said. He also noted that users should only transfer small amounts on this first, experimental version. The focus has been on getting the network to function so that users can actually send payments on the network. Padiou noted that it's unclear what the UX will look like, since it's a more forward-looking question. Blockchain.info Lightning engineer Mats Jerratsch thinks that this will be the major challenge before the technology sees ""widespread use"". ""It can be really tough to take a great piece of technology and turn it into a product, but that’s exactly what we need to do,"" he said. But developers are starting to explore the question of how users will actually use it. Lightning Labs is working on an ""easy to use"" smartphone app with Lightning network functionality. ""The key to much of this will be abstracting away technical complexities from the end user, while also enabling power users to configure their own settings,"" said Lightning Labs co-founder Elizabeth Stark. ""Stay tuned,"" she added. There are still some developers who want to sober up the enthusiasm by pointing out that no one knows exactly how Lightning will work. While a supporter of the Lightning concept, Open Bazaar lead backend developer Chris Pacia has been skeptical of all the promises made of its capabilities. Almost a year ago, he wrote a blog post out of ""frustration"" that the network was described as the end-all solution to bitcoin scaling at the expense of other ideas. He argues that there are still many unknowns, such as the routing functionality, like Padiou pointed out. Noting that he ran some python simulations of his own, he said that it might be hard to find a route through the network once users are making a transaction of a certain value, because every hop along the route will need to support that value. This could mean a slow user experience. ""It’s plausible to me that it could reliably find routes and reliably find routes that each have the same value. But it’s equally plausible to me that it regularly fails,"" he said. That said, he's not over concerned that developers won't work out the future kinks. ""They have enough brainpower behind it that I think they can work out all the problems that they have. But the issue of routing ... We're going to need more experience with it before we can tell how well it really works,"" he said, agreeing with Poon. While this remains to be seen, it's likely the first version of Lightning will soon answer these questions. At press time, roughly one in four bitcoin nodes were supporting the Segregated Witness upgrade. Lit fuse image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin Wasn't the Only Digital Currency to See Post-Election Bounce                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-wasnt-digital-currency-see-post-election-bounce/,"Markets Weekly is a weekly column analyzing price movements in the digital currency markets, and the technology's use as an asset class. This articles covers 4th November to 11th November, 2016.  The surprise US Presidential Election results pushed bitcoin 4% higher this week amid a choppy period for the digital currency markets. After opening at roughly $709 on 4th November, bitcoin neared $740, placing it within reach of its 2016 high of more than $780. But while this increase was notable, it fell short of some forecasts. Cryptocurrency fund manager Jacob Eliosoff, for example, noted that he expected bitcoin prices to benefit more starkly from the uncertainty created by the election. As previously profiled on CoinDesk, many analysts had expected a 'Brexit-like' impact, one in which the digital currency might have risen by as much as $100 on a Trump win. When it became clear that the Brexit referendum would succeed, bitcoin prices surged, rising above $650 on 24th June after falling to $550 the day before. Eliosoff told CoinDesk. Overall, bitcoin finished the week at $713.67, 3.8% higher than its opening price, but if the markets are any indication, investors may have used the proceeds to seek profit elsewhere. The privacy-oriented digital currency Monero, for example, surged more than 20% from $4.99 to $6.13 over the course of the week, Poloniex figures reveal. Monero enjoyed these sharp gains as Zcash, another digital currency that has focused on offering improved privacy features, plunged close to 75% during the period. While Zcash enjoyed a huge spike in prices at launch in October, the currency has fallen sharply since then, finishing the week at $225.74 after starting out the period at $900. Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, believes that the results are evidence that Monero is becoming an interesting asset for traders, and that there is a developing dynamic between the two competing platforms. ""As other cryptos lost ground, more money went into XMR, especially after its decline last week. XMR price has recovered and still seems to appeal to a large market on the dark web,"" he said. Eliosoff also weighed in on the situation, telling CoinDesk that ZEC's steadily growing supply may be related to Monero's rally. ""The total ZEC supply is still increasing very quickly every week, which means more sellers and a dropping price,"" he added, noting that these sellers may be putting their money into Monero. It is worth noting that while Zcash harnesses bleeding-edge cryptography in an effort to ensure privacy, Monero has thus far achieved far greater adoption on the dark web, a network of websites where buyers could benefit greatly from anonymous transactions. In contrast, Monero has been around since 2014, so it has had more time to undergo testing. Elsewhere, ether and ether classic experienced some mild volatility. Ether fell slightly, dropping from $10.83 to $10.52 to finish the period with a loss of less than 3%, according to Poloniex. Ether classic went in the other direction, rising roughly 6% from 0.082 BTC to 0.087 BTC. Analysts seemed uncertain as to the reason for ether classic's boost, though at least one major exchange (China-based BTCC) did express interest in listing the digital currency.

The application, submitted on 9th May and published earlier this week, outlines “systems and methods...for transferring an asset from a parent chain to a sidechain”. It names Blockstream CEO Adam Back and Blockstream CTO Greg Maxwell (who is also a Core contributor) as inventors. Sidechains are envisioned as a way to allow the movement of digital assets from one blockchain to another, opening the door to new kinds of applications and experiments using the tech. The application’s release comes months after the startup announced a patent pledge, saying at the time that it would make its patents and applications available under the Defensive Patent License. The application outlines how assets could be exchange between a primary blockchain and a sidechain to which it is connected, explaining: Blockstream released its first open-source code for sidechains last summer, later moving to debut a sidechains projects dubbed Liquid aimed at bitcoin exchanges. The startup raised $55m in a Series A funding round in February, and in July acquired bitcoin wallet startup GreenAddress in a bid to boost its development of sidechains.

                            One in Four Bitcoin Nodes Are Now Upgraded for SegWit                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/one-four-bitcoin-nodes-now-upgraded-segwit/,"Bitcoin network data shows that 25% of nodes worldwide are now running code for Segregated Witness. Proposed late last year as a means to scale the bitcoin network, the upgrade was released last month by the volunteer development community Bitcoin Core in its latest software version. SegWit was put forward in a bid to increase the network’s transaction capacity without increasing the block size limit, drawing both praise and criticism from some quarters of the community amid a contentious debate. Network data suggests that the software version including SegWit is now the most commonly used among note operators. Bitnodes reports that just over 25% of bitcoin nodes are running on the latest Core software – 0.13.1 – which includes the code for SegWit. By the data service's count, that's 1,362 nodes out of a total of 5,436 nodes connected to the bitcoin network that are now prepared for the upgrade. By comparison, 1,204 nodes, roughly 22% of the network, is running version 0.12.1, with 964 or nearly 18% running on 0.13.0. Alternative bitcoin implementation Bitcoin Unlimited, which allows operators to set their own variable block size, is being run by 5.6% of the network, or 306 nodes, according to the data. Despite support from a quarter of all nodes, SegWit isn’t yet activated across the network. In order for that to take place, 95% of all bitcoin miners need to adopt the software, followed by a grace period constituting 2,016 transaction blocks. The process for actually signaling support for SegWit is expected to begin sometime around 19th November on the first network difficulty retarget after the 15th of this month. In the meantime, bitcoin wallet providers and other companies have begun laying the groundwork for supporting the upgrade. The development is notable, as some in the bitcoin mining space have pledged to block the proposal unless there is movement on a bid to increase the block size.

                            How Two New Sidechains Proposals Could Change Bitcoin's DNA                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/two-new-sidechains-proposals-change-bitcoins-dna/," A long-proposed bitcoin feature called 'sidechains' may soon take a big step forward thanks to a pair of proposals. The idea behind sidechains, most associated with the startup Blockstream (whose team boasts its originators), is to make it easier to add new features to bitcoin, something that's proven difficult in the past due to bitcoin's design. In short, sidechains are supposed to make it possible for users to move bitcoins between different bitcoin-based blockchains with different rule sets. For example, in this way, new techniques for preserving the privacy of transactions or a smart contract system similar to ethereum's could be added to a bitcoin blockchain, without changing the bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin security consultant Sergio Demian Lerner, who is spearheading one effort to add sidechain functionality to bitcoin, explained that sidechains would broadly remove the difficulty developers today face in expanding bitcoin's capabilities. He told CoinDesk: But in addition to Lerner's team, another group is working on proposals that could potentially put sidechains into the official bitcoin codebase. In late September, Lerner revealed a proposal for code that could add this functionality to bitcoin, and Bloq economist Paul Sztorc told CoinDesk that he is working on code of his own. Both are so-called ""drivechain"" proposals, a spin on sidechains first described by Sztorc last November. As such, each proposes a set of new features, called an opcode, that could potentially be added to bitcoin via a change known as a soft fork (an update that doesn't require all nodes to upgrade the software). However, the two projects have different ideas about how to implement the opcode and don't plan to join forces on one proposal (at least not yet). In a transfer between sidechains, bitcoins are sent from one blockchain to another, or that's what it looks like. But in reality, bitcoins from one chain (say bitcoin) are locked on the main bitcoin blockchain, while they're simultaneously unlocked on the sidechain that they're being ""transferred"" to. The key difference between drivechains and regular sidechains is who ultimately submits the necessary information to transfer the bitcoins back and forth: the users or the miners. Lerner's version of drivechain relies on miners to be ""algorithmic proxy custodians,"" or programs that help make miners aware of other sidechains attached to the network. ""Bitcoin miners observe the state of the sidechain and when they receive a command from the sidechain having proven consent (eg a hundred confirmations), they execute a coordination protocol to make sure they all agree on the authenticity of the command,"" Lerner explained. He added: ""If they agree, they will make a payment using locked funds."" Lerner's proposal introduces a new bitcoin script called OP_COUNT_ACKS, which implements the above drivechain functionality (bitcoin scripts are like smart contracts) in about 600 lines of code, in what he called a small change. Lerner also noted that Segregated Witness, the newest major change to bitcoin, once triggered, could help with this. The code was officially added to bitcoin earlier this month, and the change could be activated by miners as early as this December. While it's widely seen as a scaling solution, it comes with other benefits. ""SegWit provides a new system for easy soft-forking: the witness script versioning system. Our BIP uses this system to add a new opcode without the limitations of the previous soft-forking system,"" Lerner explained. Sztorc is working on similar code that has yet to be publicized. But while Sztorc and Lerner have discussed and collaborated, each seems to think that their own project is best and wants to continue pursuing them separately. Sztorc's main critique with Lerner's implementation is that it's using the sidechain from another one of his efforts, Rootstock, which features ethereum-style smart contracts, rather than a copy of bitcoin. ""Drivechain is a new idea. So it's a risk as it is. I don’t like the idea of compounding that by doing two new ideas at once,"" Sztorc said.  Other differences are smaller details, Sztorc noted, using the invention of a hammer as an analogy. Say someone invents a hammer, a tool that never existed before, but they are debating whether the hammer should be built out of stone or wood. If accepted, either could eventually make its way into bitcoin in the form of a soft fork. But again, we’re talking about an update that developers compare to an in-flight airplane fix. Sidechains may be a proposal that's supposed to help with this problem, but to first add this functionality to bitcoin, it needs to pass this hurdle as other optimizations and additions, such as SegWit, have. Blockstream core tech engineer Russell O’Connor described some potential problems with Lerner's proposed opcode that boil down to the opcode depending on data values that are specific to the block that a transaction is added to. He explained that other opcodes that have been recently added to Bitcoin Core ""were carefully constructed to ensure this property."" Also of note is that there might not have been full discussion of the proposal yet. Bitcoin Core contributor Peter Todd declined to discuss the new drivechain opcode because of Lerner's past bitcoin-related patents, and said that he will reject the proposal ""until this is rectified."" Lerner responded that he has no plans to patent drivechain. Further, he said other bitcoin protocol developers, including Matt Corallo and Pieter Wiulle, are open to discussing the change. When asked about his patent strategy, Sztorc said he has ""absolutely zero intent"" on a patent, even a defensive one. Besides these specific criticisms, there's plenty of skepticism to go around to every sidechain project, with accompanying discussion about the security of each. Some long-standing criticisms boil down to whether or not sidechains are viable at all. ""The main discussion relates to the effects of putting more power in the hands of the miners and what are the long-term consequences. More specifically, the question is what would happen if a bitcoin sidechain grows so popular that [miners mining both bitcoin and the popular sidechain] need to run higher-end computers, outcompeting solo miners,"" Lerner explained. But Sztorc seemed optimistic despite the criticism, some of which he plans to address in a ""very long"" blog post in the coming weeks. ""The philosophy is mostly done and the code is mostly done. We’re both really close,"" he said. Lerner concluded much the same, adding: Molecular model image via Shutterstock

The former partner at Manatt, Phelps & Phillips started her new position at Baker Hostetler earlier this month. While Van Cleef will continue her previous focus working with bank compliance issues and cryptocurrency, she tells CoinDesk her new employer has hosted several meetings with people helping US President-elect Donald Trump transition to power. Van Cleef explained the nature of her new position to CoinDesk: Van Cleef began her new job on 1st November, after spending almost three years at Manatt. Previously, she founded anti-money laundering and OFAC compliance trading firm, Comptegrity, for which she still serves as chairman. Over the past year, she has also helped develop the Uniform Law Commission's efforts to draft a legal framework for virtual currencies, and earlier this month she was one of 50 attorneys to join launch the Digital Currency and Ledger Defense Coalition. At Manatt, her compliance practice had focused largely on helping companies understand the USA Patriot Act, BSA and OFAC regulations. BakerHostetler was founded in 1916, and currently employs about 900 partners and associates. The firm specializes in litigation, business, employment, intellectual property and tax law. According to an Intercept report yesterday, the firm had hosted ""regular"" meetings of Trump for America Inc, a non-profit group chaired by New Jersey governor Chris Christie, as part of an effort to help oversee the Trump transition. An earlier version of this article based on the conversation with Van Cleef reported that Baker Hostetler was representing Trump's transition team.

Local sources report that three Dubai citizens were defrauded after connecting online with someone claiming to be a bitcoin buyer who wanted to purchase the digital currency at a premium. According to Dubai police officials, those affected apparently let the suspect access their bitcoin wallets during the sale. Once inside, those accounts were emptied, with just over $100,000 in bitcoin being taken. Dubai officials are said to have expressed concern about the nature of the crime. Salim bin Salmin, deputy director of the Dubai Police’s Cybercrimes Department, told regional news service 7DaysUAE. The suspect, who is facing fraud charges following his arrest, was reportedly arrested after police used Instagram to set up a sting operation. Officials used the social media app to create the persona of a wealthy investor looking to buy bitcoins. ”We created an account for a young man, posted pictures of him looking wealthy and put up a message that he was looking to sell 1,000 bitcoins,” Dubai Police director Khamis Mattar Al Muzaina told the publication. After the suspect was arrested, police determined that the funds had been spent on a variety of luxury goods as well as housing costs in Dubai. Image via Shutterstock

                            Despite Trump Bump, Bitcoin Still Strives for 'Safe Haven' Status                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/despite-trump-bump-bitcoin-still-strives-safe-haven-status/," ""Not sure what to expect exactly..."" That the sentiment of at least one major bitcoin exchange executive yesterday as Americans took to the polls in what the New York Times would ultimately call a ""stunning repudiation"" of the political system. Hours later, Donald Trump, the billionaire and former reality TV star, was elected president, but the markets had already responded. As reported by CoinDesk, many traders were expecting a Trump upset to boost the bitcoin markets, with some comparing it to a ""Brexit"" scenario for the global markets. In that surprise political turn, the price of bitcoin ranged sharply, trading from a low of $550 to a high of $650 when the final decision was announced. However, last night's trading wasn't exactly the same story retold. Data from wallet provider Blockchain indicates that USD exchange volume reached an annual high during the days preceding the Brexit, though this also coincided with a planned change to bitcoin's reward generation scheme. By contrast, USD trading was muted in the days preceding the presidential election, and even the bounce many traders were expecting proved smaller than might have been anticipated. Over the past 24 hours, the price of bitcoin rose from $709 to a high of nearly $740, though at press time, the price had declined to $725. Despite this, though, it was still within striking distance of annual highs set in mid-June. At press time, the price of bitcoin was up 67% from the $434-mark in January. Yet, while Trump's victory was unexpected, the resulting boost to bitcoin doesn't appear to have done much to change the view of industry analysts. Needham & Company's Spencer Bogart, whose firm issues periodic projections for the price of bitcoin, told CoinDesk there was unlikely to be a shift its short-term projections. Earlier this year, Bogart forecast bitcoin as likely to rise to a high of $848 on improving fundamentals and progress on its core technology. Still, Bogart said that the bump served to underscore the idea that bitcoin is becoming a safe haven asset, even if he said the evidence isn't entirely there yet. ""It’s another data point that further reinforces the notion that bitcoin rallies in 'risk-off' scenarios such as geopolitical uncertainty. By adding to this track record, the probability increases that bitcoin will continue to do so going forward,"" Bogart said. Wedbush Securities director of research Gil Luria added that he does not believe bitcoin is yet correlated with other asset classes, including stocks, bonds, currency and real estate. ""I do not believe there is evidence that bitcoin is counter-cyclical or moves in the opposite direction of other assets, and I am not yet convinced that we should refer to bitcoin as a safe haven asset,"" he said. Overall, the muted response, analysts said, was likely due to the fact that bitcoin is still broadly perceived as a high-risk investment. ""Bitcoin has plenty of risks that are unique to the technology, which is why it is best suited for investors that understand those risks,"" Luria said. ""I consider a safe-haven asset an asset that has inherent downside protection, which I do not believe bitcoin will have any time soon."" Still, there was a belief that behaviors such as last night's increase on election results could do much to change that perception, cementing bitcoin's use case as a store of value, if not an off-risk asset. ""With events like today, we're seeing bitcoin perform as a safe haven, risk off asset in times like this,"" Mark Lamb, CEO of bitcoin exchange Coinfloor, said. Yet, he went on to acknowledge it's unclear exactly how to classify bitcoin as of yet. ""The fact that bitcoin grew massively in 2013 and is also growing in times of the 'Brexit' and Trump seems to demonstrate that bitcoin is uncorrelated,"" he said. As mentioned by analysts, it's perhaps the unique qualities as well as the accessibility of the digital currency markets that will perhaps help them become more interesting to mainstream investors. Bogart concluded: Trump image via Twitter

At press time, Trump has 244 votes in the Electoral College to Clinton's 215, according to CBS, and The New York Times is forecasting a Trump win.

The move comes just over a year after Gemini first opened its doors in New York. The exchange, which had been in the works since early 2015, came online following its successful bid for a bank charter. Yet the exchange struggled to find traders following its launch, and may be looking past US shores in a bid to attract more activity. Customers in both countries will have access to bitcoin and ether trading, both markets of which will trade against the US dollar. South Korean and Japanese customers will also have access to Gemini's daily bitcoin auction. The company said: Gemini's launch in the two Asian countries comes during a dynamic period for them both.

Conditions in Japan – home of the now-defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox – are perhaps more ripe for expansion.

Originally prepared by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) in September, the report casts a gloomy portrait of the US tax agency’s efforts to oversee and tax digital currency transactions. According to the TIGTA, there is ""little evidence"" that US tax officials have moved to create a broader, more cohesive strategy in the two-and-a-half years since the agency declared its intention to tax bitcoin as a kind of property. Other issues include a lack of controls for third-party tools used to report transactions. A continued failure to address the concerns means that the IRS is at risk of missing taxpayer violations, the report warned. The IG wrote: Compounding the current state of affairs, the report goes on to outline, is the fact that the agency failed to respond to or otherwise adopt proposals made via public comment after the 2014 policy release. The IRS has faced criticism in the past from tax professionals, who argued that the agency hadn’t provided consumers with enough information regarding the taxation of bitcoin and other digital currencies. In its report, the IG acknowledged that the 2014 policy release was problematic regarding some of the reporting mandates, particularly relating to documentation. “Due to the potential complexity of reporting otherwise simple retail purchase transactions related to virtual currencies, further guidance is needed to help taxpayers voluntarily comply with their tax obligations,” the IG said. Yet the agency is committed to change. In the report, the IG said that the IRS had agreed to improve its existing bitcoin tax practices, with an eye to potentially rework how its reporting documents are structured. In total, the TIGTA issued three recommendations, and in all cases, the IRS agreed with the findings.

                            In 2016 US Election, Bitcoin and Blockchain Were Blips on Campaign Radar                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-bitcoin-blockchain-campaign/," As the US election ramped up last summer, the CoinDesk editorial team began to wonder: Given the mistrust in banks and financial firms, would bitcoin and blockchain become an election issue? The answer, it turned out, was a resounding no, as neither major party candidate weighed in substantively on the issue. CoinDesk spent much of the past year and a half attempting to engage with the campaigns of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump to no avail. Phone calls to their respective headquarters in Brooklyn and Manhattan went unanswered. We saw Clinton's campaign pay lip service to the tech in a broad policy statement, only to learn months later that her senior campaign officials saw the digital currency as ""too Libertarian"" to accept. In one case, spokeswoman Hope Hicks declined comment by email – a degree of responsiveness the Clinton campaign would fail to achieve. We thought we might get lucky. In the end, to quote Donald Trump, we were wrong. Nor did the campaigns of early hopefuls like Ted Cruz and Bernie Sanders engage with us either (though there was a promising start in the latter case). Ultimately, none of the major candidates would go on the record with any publication about the tech or the sweeping changes it promises to bring to industries and consumers. Yet, this isn’t to say the election didn’t have its moments. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul spoke openly about bitcoin, as did Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson, both of whom accepted donations in the digital currency. (We also asked the campaign for Green Party candidate Jill Stein what they thought, but our calls went unreturned). Still, in the midst of it all, we saw Congress push for broad action on the tech (in as legally nonbinding a way as possible). One proposal even sought to potentially rethink how we manage health care for veterans using blockchain. We also saw the start of a process at the top US elections watchdog to perhaps reclassify what a bitcoin donation is exactly. Along the way, some would speculate that particular winners might push bitcoin markets this way or that. So, there was movement, albeit in a piecemeal fashion. One could even argue that the stage was set for 2020 to be the presidential election year that bitcoin and blockchain become a campaign issue or even gets asked about in a presidential debate (our attempts to get a bitcoin question into the Democratic Party and GOP debates in New Hampshire were unsuccessful). With Congressional action on the tech likely to happen over the next four years, there might soon be change. Here’s hoping. Image Credit: JStone / Shutterstock.com

                            Bitcoin Traders Believe Trump Win Could Trigger Price Boost                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-traders-believe-trump-win-trigger-price-boost/," Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump? While America may be undecided, there's a widespread belief among bitcoin investors and analysts that a Trump presidency would provide a limited, but impactful, boost to bitcoin prices. Such commentary follows on the heels of the UK's decision to leave the European Union in June, a development that many analysts credited with spurring uncertainty and causing a $100 increase in the price of bitcoin over just one trading session. Analysts noted that while the digital currency markets might not see any significant change from Clinton's election, Trump could offer a marked contrast due to how his election is likely to impact global investors. Previously put forward by independent research, traders appear now to largely agree Trump would be a boon for bitcoin business. Cryptocurrency hedge fund manager Jacob Eliosoff told CoinDesk: Elsewhere, analysts took a less alarming tone to the potential results, stating a Trump win could provide a small but notable boost for the digital currency. If Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton wins, it will have “little or no"" effect on bitcoin prices, said another cryptocurrency hedge fund manager, Tim Enneking. If anything, the digital currency might ""fall a bit,"" he said. Certain political observers have predicted that if Clinton wins, her policy stances could result in her term largely being a continuation of President Obama's. Amid perceptions like these, many expect that her ascension to the Oval Office would come with limited uncertainty. Others have suggested Clinton could be a boon for the public blockchain markets given her open embrace of the tech as part of her innovation platform. However, her policy to all parts of the ecosystem, including bitcoin, arguably aren't yet clear. While Trump hasn't put the digital currency on his agenda, he has cast himself as a Washington outsider, something that traders believe could stoke uncertainty (and with it a move toward alternative assets). This could create only a temporary jump in bitcoin prices, predicted Enneking, but he suggested it would have little lasting effect. ""[Trump] would certainly increase uncertainty domestically and, to some extent, globally, and that would provide a short-term, upward push to bitcoin prices,"" he said. Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub, provided similar input, emphasizing the uncertainty that would surround a Trump victory would create a “short-lived” impact on bitcoin prices. He added: Even those who did not offer an opinion on which candidate would boost the markets were ready for increased trading. Mark Lamb, CEO of UK-based Coinfloor, for instance, noted he expects increased volumes as a result of the US election. Still, there was a sense that any boost to bitcoin would further cement its status as one of the newer and more unconventional ""safe haven"" assets in times of financial crisis. ARK Invest's Chris Burniske, for example, emphasized that bitcoin can prove helpful for those looking to diversify their portfolios in unpredictable times, and said the election could add evidence to this claim. ""The way in which its price movement is uncorrelated from other capital market assets may be a desirable characteristic for many investors in the face of uncertainty,"" he said. ""Depending on how people feel about the election, they may choose to hedge themselves from the more traditional markets by using bitcoin."" Bobby Lee, CEO of China-based bitcoin exchange BTCC, was less concerned about the election, asserting that bitcoin will enjoy adoption as a financial tool no matter the outcome.

College Teams Compete in $10k Crypto Investment Contest                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/college-teams-10k-prize-bitcoin-contest/,"Students from 13 colleges worldwide are vying for a $10,000 first prize in a cryptocurrency investment contest. Sponsored by digital currency exchange Kraken and curated by The Economist, the “Kraken Case Study Competition” sees teams aiming to craft what they believe is the most effective strategy for investing $1m in a digital currency portoflio. Participants must choose whether to stock their portfolios with bitcoin, ether (the cryptocurrency of the ethereum platform) or some combination of the two. From there, they'll need to defend their choice, not just for the short-term but the long term as well – their portfolio, according to the rules, would need to sit for 5 years before any returns can be realized. In order to win, the teams involved must make their case via video – the entries can already be seen online. Second and third place entries will take $5,000 and $3,000, respectively, with a People’s Choice award (along with a $3,000 cash prize) up for grabs following online voting. Jesse Powell, CEO of Kraken, said in a statement: Some of the schools involved in the contest include Rutgers Business School, John Hopkins Carey Business School and Worcester Polytechnic Institute, among others. Entry videos can be found here. The winners are expected to be announced next month.

                            China's Bitcoin Miners See Profit in a Bigger-Block Blockchain                        ",Eric Mu,https://www.coindesk.com/china-miners-big-blocks/," It was not entirely an idle joke when one speaker at China's first miner conference quipped that if the audience decided to launch a 51% attack against the bitcoin network, they would probably be able to pull it off. Over a foggy weekend, around 250 people (the majority being miners gathered in Chengdu) filled a rather spacious conference hall to its capacity for an event called China's Miners' Conference, a mostly promotional event organized by major miner Bitmain. But, they came for more than the province's famous spicy food. As of late, Sichuan has acquired the reputation of being the center of bitcoin mining. Its hydroelectric power (which faces a serious oversupply issue) has attracted hordes of miners, there to set up data center-sized mining farms. But miners are not the only people you were likely to meet at the event. Some were there to pass business cards and tell you that they have access to cheap power or can help you build large mining farms in more cost-efficient ways, eager to profit from the miners. Others didn't have products to sell. Rather, Huang Shiliang, the popular bitcoin writer, was here with an idea that holds the same promise, supposedly, to help miners increase their margins. Onstage, Huang is an orator with a penchant to making extraordinary claims, and his comments on scaling the bitcoin blockchain would likely strike foreign listeners as unusual given the perception in the West that new technical solutions have quelled the debate. In his talk, Huang spoke at length about how he first became interested in bitcoin. But, he returned to a common theme – profit. ""In 2014, I bought a lot of bitcoins – back then, those old hands told me that in 10 years, one bitcoin will be worth $10,000. I figured that if that is true, I would be rich by then,” he said. He also proved himself adept at sirring up the crowd. ""Today, I came with a question. How long do you want to mine?"" Huang said. From the audience shouts ring out: 'Forever!' 'For life!'. ""My answer is 8 years,"" he said, pausing to let the suspense sink in. When addressing an audience of miners, it seems, there is no better way to open than asking how long they intend to be in the business. Huang's most notable comments addressed the issue of scaling, or how the bitcoin blockchain might be upgraded for more transactions. Rather than focus on incremental solutions (like Segregated Witness, introduced in the latest bitcoin software update), he took an opposite approach. His talk saw him arguing for the aggressive on-chain scaling tactics that have earned a notable minority of enthusiasts. When Huang took up the subject, he suggested miners ""pretty much determine"" how the bitcoin network will scale. He then turned to the projector screen where charts pulled from bitcoin data service Blockchain.info were on display. ""This chart shows the recent two years transaction volume – it had been on a upward trend until hitting a hard limit and since then it hasn’t show growth for half year. Why no growth? Because blocks are full. Look at this chart, it shows that blocks are all full in the past 90 days,"" he said. Huang positioned this technical limitation as one that should be considered from an economic perspective. Limited space, he said, would lead to higher fees, turning away potential bitcoin users. ""Many people are advocating this. Let's raise the fee and price out those who refuse to pay higher fee. Can this be done? Very hard. The higher the fee, the less users, the smaller the amount of transactions, the total amount of fees will decrease – and there is no reason that people have to use bitcoin,"" he said. Huang said other alternative cryptocurrencies, like litecoin or ethereum, could maybe gain traction in this environment. In the face of this, Huang discussed how the current 1MB limit on transactions per block would be raised to 2MB, 8MB or ""removed completely"". He argued that bigger blocks would be better for miners, and more lucrative. ""Here is the reasoning – if block size grows larger, how will miners be affected? Eight years from now, suppose the block size is eight gigabits – bear in mind this is purely hypothetical, then the daily transaction fee will be 1,000 times of today's 59 BTC, which is 59,000 BTC. If you still own 1/100 of the total hashrate, you will have 500 BTC, that will be a huge amount – this is the mathematical proof that large blocks will earn you more transaction fees,"" he said. Huang continued this thinking, arguing that larger blocks would give mining hardware more longevity. Certainly, it's an issue close to the wallets of many miners. ""If we pass a law limiting that the entire world can only process three tons of steel, obviously the most advanced equipment will eliminate the old one,"" Huang said. He later called on attendees to envision an Internet that was limited in how it could provide data confirmation. After some even more elaboration, he revealed his solution – bigger blocks. Huang said: Of note, is that his remarks, while illustrative of conversation in China, have since been criticized by bitcoin developers. Following the talk, they cited research that suggests comments made by Huang are misguided due to how the value of bitcoins are determined through a broad consensus of participants.  Bitcoin Core developers cited the work of Princeton researchers that found bitcoin to be unstable without a valuable block subsidy, a finding that would seem to contradict that a fee market could power bitcoin alone. Further, developers assert that miners would not able to unilaterally switch to a new blockchain through a hard fork, as they would need the consent of full nodes and consumers, who would need to want to use the blockchain for commerce. This would then carry the risk that two chains emerge, substantially devaluing the currency. But, it remains to be seen whether technical arguments will be able to sway miners to back a more incremental alternative that would scale the protocol by way of a soft fork. Miners are now able to flag support for SegWit, but the technical upgrade requires that 95% of miners show support for the change for two weeks before it can be activated.

The hype surrounding Zcash faded in the week through 3rd November, with the new digital currency's prices suffering sharp declines early in the week. On its 28th October launch, the ZEC/BTC currency pair reached roughly 3,300 BTC (more than $2m), but fell to below a value of 1 BTC by 30th October, Poloniex figures reveal. The pair then mounted a recovery, rising to 3.58 BTC on 31st October, followed by another sharp drop to 1.29 BTC by 4th November. Market analysts reported that this was the result of a decline in trader interest as supply for the new token, at first exceedingly rare, increased. Petar Zivkovski, director of operations for Whaleclub, noted that Zcash now needs to ""find its utility, grow a developer network and develop a support network"" before it can be taken more seriously. Zivkovski said: But while the digital currency’s supply is low for the time being, it is ""increasing quickly"", according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder and CEO of leveraged bitcoin trading platform BitMEX. He went on to speculate as to how a new influx of ZEC will affect price going forward, telling CoinDesk he believes a bubble in the market is deflating. ""By year end, I expect the price of Zcash to be below 0.10 BTC,"" he said. ZeroHedge, citing Bloomberg sources, reported that China's government is looking into potential capital controls for bitcoin. An article appearing on Bloomberg Terminal also provided similar reporting. Zivkovski weighed in on how this development (combined with a handful of market factors) could drive a notable downward movement. ""This catalyst combined with smart money eager to cash in on the multi-month price rise and a highly leveraged long market ... caused the sharp declines we witnessed today and yesterday,"" he said. While these variables provided a reasonable explanation for bitcoin’s price movements, more than one market observer expressed skepticism about the rumor that the Chinese government was looking into imposing capital controls on bitcoin. ""I don't think even China could successfully implement capital controls on bitcoin,"" said bitcoin hedge fund operator Jacob Eliosoff. ""It would be like banning sending prime numbers."" He added that: ""What they could do much more easily is shut down the Chinese exchanges."" Hayes told CoinDesk that he doesn’t place ""any truth"" in the rumor involving the Chinese government placing restrictions on the trading and ownership of bitcoin. He further voiced his doubts about such a policy change, as any such move ""would be made very clearly through official channels."" Beyond that, he asserted that the size of bitcoin’s market cap means that the digital currency is ""not a relevant channel for money escaping China."" After moving lower in the first half of the week, prices for tokens on the alternative ethereum blockchain, ethereum classic (ETC) remained calm, even though market observers voiced concerns about the technology's long-term viability. More than one expert has expressed concerns that ethereum classic, which came into existence when the original ethereum blockchain experienced a hard fork, might have a hard time remaining viable in the long-term. Zivkovski asserted that ethereum classic lacks both a support network and a ""thriving"" developer community, though there are signs the group is becoming better organized. Eliosoff took a different view, emphasizing that digital currencies need potential users, and he sees ""zero evidence of a user base eager for ETC."" However, Hayes provided a more optimistic assessment of the blockchain and its potential, stating that there are ""very many committed"" people and organizations involved with the digital currency, especially in China. As a result, he offered a bullish prediction for the currency. ""I think ETC is due for a pop in price,"" he told CoinDesk. ""It will happen when the majority of people believe it has died.""

                            Stolen Bitcoin? Anti-Theft Feature Gets Second Life on Sidechains                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-anti-theft-feature-sees-sidechains-testing/," At its core, bitcoin is about giving users better control of their money. Often called ""programmable money"", bitcoin has scripts that limit how future bitcoin transactions can be spent (and that control variables like who can spend them). One such script ensures the correct person is spending the bitcoin by checking if the correct signature was used before unlocking and sending the funds. This week, Blockstream core tech developer Russell O'Connor revealed he's been testing a couple of new scripts on an Elements Alpha sidechain (which is pegged to the bitcoin testnet) that could add new functionality. Called ""covenants"", the new style of scripts potentially opens up possibilities for how bitcoin users can control, or restrict, spending of their money — possibly for their protection. (This is an idea that was previously explored by researchers Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal, and Emin Gun Sirer). One use case for these scripts is to help users rein in their coins in the case of a hack (an all too common occurrence in bitcoin). When asked what he thinks of the new covenant work, Eyal said it was potentially a boon to bitcoin users who may be worried about losing their bitcoins or otherwise having them compromised or stolen. Eyal told CoinDesk: The idea is notable as a script that can limit how bitcoins can be spent hasn't been implemented in bitcoin before, a fact noted by Eyal. In particular, there are two new covenant scripts that Blockstream explored, each of which take parameters and outputs whether the script is valid, or whether or not the transaction is currently spendable based on its restrictions. It's worth noting that bitcoin’s scripting system is currently quite simple for security's sake. There aren't limitless rules in bitcoin right now because new additions can be potentially dangerous and developers note that they take time to test. This is where sidechains may come in handy, although they are not yet pinned to the main blockchain. Bitcoin startup Blockstream has been working on these interoperable blockchains for experimenting with new features that could potentially be added to bitcoin since June of last year, and this is an example of how these new chains can be used to test new features. These new proposed opcodes may work as the foundations for new functionalities, ones that could even come to help stop bitcoin exchanges and users from losing stolen funds. But while Blockstream is running with the idea, it began with researchers at Cornell. In February, researchers Malte Möser, Ittay Eyal and Emin Gun Sirer proposed the idea of bitcoin vaults (implemented with their own version of covenants) where users could pull bitcoin back in the case of a hack. (It then gained new life following the hack on Bitfinex, in which the exchange lost nearly 120,000 BTC). ""If the attacker can't gain control of the money, it takes away the motivation for stealing it in the first place,"" Eyal explained. But he noted that these two requirements are often conflicting: if a user creates new keys to avoid losing them, that means it's easier for them to be stolen. Meanwhile, if you create a smaller number of total keys, it's easier to lose them. While Blockstream tested vaults as a potential use case, there might be other future uses for the covenant scripts, including lending. The idea seems to have been dormant for a while and developers were debating its viability even just a couple of months ago. But these sidechain tests might mean a step towards implementation. And while covenants and vaults had drawn some skepticism before (Peter Todd has questioned whether such a functionality should be built in the infrastructure layer of the code at Scaling Bitcoin), there seems to be optimism that it could work. When asked if the new scripts were safe, Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell responded: Disclosure: CoinDesk is a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group, which has an ownership stake in Blockstream.

                            Bitcoin Price Drops 5% as New China Rumors Stoke Trading                        ",Pete Rizzo,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-price-china-rumor-trading/," After weeks of gains, the price of bitcoin fell back today, dropping roughly 6% on unconfirmed reports that Chinese regulators may soon take measures to restrict domestic exchange activities. First reported by Bloomberg, the news source is said to have published a report detailing how Chinese officials could soon prohibit domestic bitcoin exchanges from moving certain volumes of bitcoin and other digital currencies abroad. Of note, the article alleges, are concerns that bitcoin exchange users may be buying bitcoin on local exchanges and selling abroad, thereby evading foreign exchange rules. At press time, however, the article in question was not available online, though it was cited by other news outlets including Sina and ZeroHedge. Price declines began at 15:00 UTC, seemingly coinciding with the spread of the news across social media. The price would fluctuate wildly over the course of the day's trading, rising to a high of $744 and falling to a low of $677. But given the uncertainty surrounding the news, some analysts said the market was likely using the reports as an opportunity to capitalize on a pending market panic. Adamant Research's Tuur Demeester told CoinDesk: Other analysts reported that similar behavior was likely given that fake news about China has often been used as way to encourage speculative market activity. Such comments recall the height of bitcoin's price climb in 2013, when the news that China would perhaps ""ban"" the digital currency caused steep market declines. ""We've had China scares like this so many times,"" Chris DeRose, the host of a popular bitcoin podcast, recalled. He added: ""China is effectively a black box to us here.""

Local media reports that 33-year-old Ryota Fujii committed identity fraud by using the unnamed woman’s personal ID information to purchase ¥600,000 (roughly $6,000 at press time) worth of bitcoin by way of a fraudulently obtained credit card. Those sources say it’s the first case of its kind to take place in Japan. The suspect is said to have claimed that he stole the funds in order to settle outstanding debts against him. “I had debts to pay back,” Fujii reportedly said.

Days after Swiss rail operator SBB made international headlines for the decision to sell bitcoin through its network of ticket kiosks, the country’s Federal Department of Finance (FDF) outlined its plans to regulate fintech with an eye to introduce legislation sometime next year. Key elements include plans for a new kind of license geared specifically toward fintech companies and a so-called regulatory “sandbox” for experimental firms. Under the proposed regime, the Financial Market Supervisory Authority would become the primary regulator of fintech firms working in Switzerland. Questions remain, however. In a statement, the FDF said that it will pursue additional research into bitcoin and other digital currencies, as well as broader applications of blockchain. The agency said today: During a press conference, Swiss Finance Minister Ueli Maurer argued that the proposed fintech legislation would help draw in more companies – though the country’s accommodative stance has already led some blockchain startups to make their home in Switzerland. ""We assume that with the steps we have prepared and the commitment we have to the overall financial services industry we can provide a solution that puts us among the top (countries) in the world that regulate this,"" he said, according to Reuters.

At least that's how BTCC CEO Bobby Lee describes his Shanghai-based bitcoin exchange startup's affiliation with its domestic market. Formerly known as BTC China, BTCC markets itself as the ""world's longest-running bitcoin exchange"", but it's now taking steps to expand its customer base internationally. BTCC announced today that it is launching a new service BTCC USD Exchange, one that boasts a new user-interface and that is operated by a separate legal entity. Run out of Hong Kong, the US dollar trading arm will complement BTCC's Chinese yuan trading, and Lee said support for more currencies is likely to follow. It officially launches tomorrow. Lee told CoinDesk: Notably, the offering will not yet be available to US customers, as BTCC has yet to receive approval from FinCEN or the NYDFS. (Lee said the startup had applied for both, though it's far from alone in waiting to launch services in New York). But Lee also sees a strategic opening in the market given the breach of Bitfinex, the Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange that this August lost nearly 120,000 BTC (then worth more than $60m) in a high-profile hack. ""We're trying to go up against Bitfinex,"" Lee said. ""I think their volume is thin."" In conversation, Lee was open about thinking that BTCC could ""outdo"" the exchange, which has long held an appeal with traders given its margin trading system. In this light, Lee said that BTCC is exploring whether to add margin trading, and that it is taking steps to court already active bitcoin exchange users. BTCC said it will use a link-based referral program, FIX APIs and maker-taker model to incentivize customers. Further, it will offer faster deposits due to an integration with its existing mining pool. BTCC image via Facebook

                            Bitcoin Update Brings Scaling Solution Closer to Activation                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-software-version-0-13-1-release/,"An update to the bitcoin software that features code that could potentially activate a long-anticipated scaling solution has been released. Issued on Thursday and dedicated solely to code called Segregated Witness (SegWit), version 0.13.1 allows miners to signal support for the scaling solution after 15th November. If activated, the code also instructs nodes on how to validate the new type of transactions that will result from the patch. (SegWit boosts the bitcoin block size by a factor of about 1.8x by moving transaction signatures to another data structure). But there are still a series of steps left before the software will be triggered through a process known as a soft fork. For one, the update requires near-universal support from miners. The code will be 'locked-in' once 95% of a series of 2,016 blocks (roughly two weeks worth of blocks) are broadcast by those running the new code. Next, wallet holders will need to make changes if they want to take advantage of the update. However, despite high expectations, it's unclear whether SegWit will reach the 95% threshold. Mining pool ViaBTC has been particularly outspoken about its support for alternative scaling proposals, arguing that bigger blocks should still be considered as a scaling mechanism. However, the pool (which makes up roughly 5% of bitcoin’s mining power) has seen its support dwindle, perhaps as a result of its controversial stance. If triggered, code change also paves the way for other updates, including the Lightning Network (another proposed scaling solution), and easier future soft forks. Other potential benefits are detailed on the Bitcoin Core website. But while there are a still a few steps to go (and a few signs of division among supporters), Bitcoin Core developer Greg Maxwell has been optimistic. In a recent reddit post, Maxwell indicated that he believes the code could be ""active by Christmas"". Russian dolls image via Shutterstock

                            Making Sense of Hillary Clinton's Bitcoin Rejection                        ",Corin Faife,https://www.coindesk.com/making-sense-hillary-clintons-bitcoin-rejection/," For Hillary Clinton's campaign, accepting bitcoin was ""too libertarian"". That's what we learned last week when it was revealed senior campaign aides for the US presidential candidate considered taking bitcoin campaign donations, but dismissed the idea. The email was part of the cache released by Wikileaks, but came to light via a social media thread dedicated to sharing noteworthy content from the many thousands of leaked messages. For some market observers, the content of the conversation raised questions about the Clinton campaign and its knowledge of the technology. That's because, back in June, the Clinton campaign declared that its candidate supported public service blockchain applications. The claim implied some familiarity with the mechanics of bitcoin (it's the first implementation of blockchain technology, after all), even though the policy seems more likely to have been written by a tech-savvy advisor. So what is the Democratic hopeful's position on bitcoin? The campaign did not respond to requests for comment, but other analysts shared ideas. Brian Forde, former technology advisor to the White House and a senior lecturer at MIT, believes the potential future president has a genuine commitment. Forde told CoinDesk: He suggested that this support might take the form of funding for cryptocurrency research, supporting the adoption of blockchain applications in government and working with experts to develop a regulatory framework that would stimulate industry growth. In this light, conversations with industry observers suggest there may be a simpler answer for the decision – bitcoin as it stands just isn't that usable for campaign donations today. Funding a modern electoral campaign requires enormous resources, but regulations currently mean it's difficult to tap into revenue from bitcoin users. Even when donations are made to candidates who accept them, there is currently a $100 limit on bitcoin donations compared to the $2,700 limit on personal donations from other monetary sources. This was spelled out in an FEC ruling in 2014, which also imposes other restrictions on how bitcoin may be spent; for example, specifying that it must be exchanged for dollars first. Due to these restrictions, Hillary Clinton's campaign aides may have judged that the potential benefits of accepting bitcoin simply did not outweigh the costs. ""I suspect that, for $100 or less, [accepting bitcoin] was not worth the trouble,"" said Kenneth Gross, partner at Skadden LLP and a specialist in electoral finance law. ""The long and short of it is: not worth the hassle."" Still, some candidates thought the payment method a worthy cause. For example, Republican Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky became the first US presidential candidate to accept bitcoin donations earlier this year, and he was shortly followed by Libertarian Gary Johnson. While the current limit may inhibit donations, though, there are early indications that it may not be in place for much longer.  The $100 limit puts the bitcoin donation ceiling on a par with cash contributions, which are restricted in the interest of keeping campaign finance traceable, but there are other ways in which campaigns could accept these donations so as to provide a higher level of documentation and accountability. ""If you have a candidate put up a bitcoin address on their website and you donate to that, well, that's just like cash,"" said Jerry Brito, executive director of advocacy group Coin Center.  However, Brito noted that he believes bitcoin can be used in ways that suggest it should be treated more in line with other common online spending methods. He told CoinDesk: So far, the FEC is showing signs it might agree.  The agency recently announced a notice of proposed rulemaking with regards to technological modernization, showing an intent to overhaul their policy with regards to electronic means of donation.  During the public consultancy phase, Coin Center will be pushing for the limit for bitcoin donations to be brought in line with other online transactions like credit card payments.  If larger donations are permitted, Brito predicts that bitcoin users on both sides of the political spectrum would see a chance to promote their interests by donating with cryptocurrency. ""Bitcoin is interesting in that the medium is the message. If you make a contribution with bitcoin ... you're signalling that you care about bitcoin, and that's really unique,"" he said. For now, it seems it remains to be seen whether bitcoin users would have backed one candidate over the other.  With the presidential election now less than two weeks away, we’ll have to wait for a future election cycle to see if digital currency can have a real-world impact.

                            Bitcoin Prices Roar Past $700 But Zcash Steals The Show                        ",Charles Bovaird,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-breaks-700-zcash-steals-show/," Bitcoin may be nearing annual highs, but newcomer Zcash stole the show this week, generating robust momentum even before its launch. The digital currency, whose use of zero-knowledge proofs is said to offer cryptocurrency users new levels of privacy, released its blockchain and first tokens (zerocoins) on 28th October. In anticipation of the launch, nascent Zcash futures markets saw robust trading. The pairs, which traded against bitcoin prior to the release of zerocoins, rose from a low of 0.027 BTC ($18.50) on 15th September to 0.78 BTC ($535) on 28th October. Yet, this figure surged nearly 1,200% to 10 BTC ($6,864) on the day of their launch. This wasn't the end of its story, however. With a unique release schedule, speculation hit highs often unseen even in the volatile cryptocurrency sector. Zcash rose to far more impressive heights on digital currency exchange Poloniex, with the price of 1 ZEC reaching roughly 3,300 BTC (or more than $2m), on 28th October. This sharp increase gave way to equally jolting losses, as Zcash was trading at 48 BTC later in the day. Tim Enneking, chairman of Crypto Currency Fund, described the price movements as ""crazy"". ""There's no way this valuation’s gonna hold,"" he said in reference to the lofty prices reached by Zcash futures. He added: In spite of all the momentum surrounding Zcash, some market observers emphasized that more than one currency has enjoyed surging value before fading from relevance. ""Like all other cryptos, Zcash will need to prove useful to a large enough market for a long enough period of time to avoid death or irrelevance,"" said Petar Zivkovkski, director of operations for leveraged bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub. Digital currency hedge fund manager Jacob Eliosoff took a different tack, asserting that Zcash may be slightly overhyped. In particular, he cited other blockchain communities that have focused on privacy solutions and that are already in use in the market. ""Zcash looks like it may offer slightly more thorough anonymity than Monero, but not a major difference from a user or business perspective,” he told CoinDesk. Eliosoff emphasized that users don’t need the latest cryptocurrency so much as they need digital currencies that protect their identities and work effectively. While Zcash grabbed the lion’s share of attention this week, bitcoin enjoyed a 9% gain as market dynamics and concerns about China’s continued devaluation of the yuan pushed prices higher. Bitcoin prices surged from $628.62 at 12:00 UTC on 21st October to $686.52 by 12:00 UTC on 28th October, CoinDesk USD Bitcoin Price Index figures reveal. At press time, bitcoin had jumped even further, rising almost 4% to a high of $713. The digital currency's upward price movement triggered many short squeezes ""across leveraged trading platforms,"" said Zivkovkski, though others suggested the renewed momentum may amount to more of a comeback after weeks of sideways trading. Whaleclub data indicates that during the week through 12:00 UTC, the market was more than 90% long on all but one day. The cryptocurrency might enjoy further gains as traders shift their focus away from altcoins, said Eliosoff. He emphasized that bitcoin has both recovered from the Bitfinex hack and approached $700. Now, ""investors have begun to take profit on various altcoins and focus on the king crypto."" Both ethereum (ETH) and its alternative blockchain ethereum classic (ETC) suffered weekly losses as the two currencies seem clouded by uncertainty. The former dropped 6% week-over-week amid sustained denial-of-service attacks, and the latter dropped 4.6% as the ethereum classic blockchain executed a hard fork to stop the same issues. ""The hard fork as well as turmoil and DDoS attacks on the ethereum network have impacted prices negatively,"" said Zivkovski. ""ETH and ETC are going through an identity crisis: of what use will they be in a future powered by digital currencies?"" Enneking also weighed in on the future relevance of the two currencies, though he stated that the price declines were an obvious side effect of the more immediate technical issues. ""When ethereum is being attacked repeatedly, that doesn’t look good in the eyes of consumers,"" he quipped. Carousel image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin's Block Size Debate is Back (And It Might Be Worse Than Ever)                        ",Alyssa Hertig,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoins-block-size-debate-still-raging-might-worse-ever/," Call it bitcoin's broken record. First heating up in 2015, a debate about how best to scale the digital currency's underlying blockchain remains the dominating disagreement. Despite the best efforts of developers to bring what they say is more nuance to the discussion, a single metric remains the biggest sticking point. One year later, some miners are again calling for measures that would raise the bitcoin block size in an effort to support more transactions and (they say) grow its user base. Likewise, the developers behind Bitcoin Core (its primary software) remain focused on increasing capacity by way of top-level protocols, arguing that developers and academics believe this is the safest way forward for the still-experimental project. So, what's different this time around? For one, a viable scaling solution that boosts the block size, but doesn't focus on the metric (Segregated Witness or 'SegWit') has completed testing and has been released. Further, a new mining pool (ViaBTC) and a prominent bitcoin investor (Roger Ver) are currently running software that supports larger blocks. The presence of a major miner means the big block movement has some leverage this time in threatening to block SegWit, or perhaps creating its own network through a process known as a 'fork'. Chairman of the board at the Factom Foundation, David A Johnston, argued that given these recent events a fork is inevitable. In a series of blog posts, he put forth the idea that both groups now have different goals, and that because of this, they may be better off working on two separate networks. He told CoinDesk: Not everyone agrees with Johnson's view. Critics argue that past attempts by miners to bid for a bigger block size have largely failed, and that this one is no different. ""I don't think it's going to happen. There is a very-loud-micro-tiny-minority making arguments not based on reality or future resiliency,"" said Coinkite CEO and founder Rodolfo Novak. Novak noted that Bitcoin Unlimited follows similar proposals, including Bitcoin XT and Bitcoin Classic, both of which released code to increase the block size to 8 MB and 2 MB, respectively, up from 1 MB today. But while these proposals generated discussion at first, neither succeeded at reaching the 75% hashrate support threshold to trigger an upgrade. This time, though, it's the continued support of miners that has some observers taking this fork attempt seriously. ""If the hashrate continues to climb, and I see no reason why it won't, it is a real concern,"" said Steven McKie, product operations manager at Yours, a bitcoin-based social content platform. But it's hard to say with other scaling solutions on the way. McKie pointed to the fact that recent announcements suggest SegWit and Lightning – scaling methods preferred by Core developers – are moving forward. ""With Lightning-like implementations coming online, it may dull the block size debate enough to keep things going business as usual. [It's] hard to gauge at the moment until we see next moves,"" McKie said. Either way, Johnston thinks that the only natural solution to the long-standing debate is for the network to split along social lines. ""Rather than continue endless fights on the topic, it seems more productive for the two groups to go their separate ways,"" he said. He argued that ethereum’s split was a great example of a successful social fork, since each group can now focus on their respective vision for the network without the previous bitterness. On the other hand, BTCC chief operating officer Samson Mow argued that ViaBTC and others can fork to form their own currency at any time (without a hard fork).  ""If they truly believe the current block size is holding back exponential adoption, causing users to suffer from high fees or unreliable confirmation times and preventing business with millions of users from integrating bitcoin, then shouldn't they fork to solve all of those dire problems?"" he argued. For now, however, it seems the two groups are still attached to their economic marriage. Mow worried the move could threaten not only bitcoin's future but the livelihood of those who are dedicated to supporting it. ""A contentious hard-fork would wipe out billions of dollars in value for people and companies who hold bitcoin as an asset,"" he said. Still, these comments suggest that the past ethereum hard fork continues to be a reference point in bitcoin's debate. The best-known display of a hard fork without full support (and its failure or success depending on point of view), the two networks (ethereum and ethereum classic) now both operate separately, commanding about as much value as they did before. But, bitcoin's supporters believe its status could be harmed by a similar move, eroding confidence that the network will deliver on its promise to differ from traditional, top-down payment networks by ditching majority rule. In this way, the hard fork debate may be more about whether 95% is too high a threshold to enact a change on a blockchain, or whether all participants in a blockchain are really part of a willing economic coalition. Johnston worried that bitcoin will never progress if changes to the software require all of its participants to agree. ""The 95% level of adoption seems a recipe for calcification, where new innovations effectively become impossible to get adopted,"" Johnston said. Others, like faculty member at the University of Nicosia, George Papageorgiou, are optimistic about bitcoin’s future and see the block size debate as a healthy ongoing conversation, as bitter as it has been. ""Discourse and different opinions are very much a part of this evolution and I don't think they should stop or be hampered in any way,"" he said. While many bitcoin developers and observers oppose the most recent effort to fork, most agree that the option is on the table. Adding fuel to the fire is that, without solid definitions, everyone is free to come to their own conclusion about how and when such decisions are made. ""There's nothing wrong with a hard fork. The only question is how it's done,"" Mow said, again arguing for a non-contentious change. This disagreement has also arguably diminished developer attention to the issue. Blockstream co-founder and Bitcoin Core developer Matt Corallo noted the lack of hard fork proposals at bitcoin's most recent annual developer conference, noting that Core developers are not ignoring the topic. ""Private discussion"" has been ongoing, he said, with many suggesting rollout proposals to make a hard fork easier. He wrote: Cracked CD-rom image via Shutterstock

                            Bitcoin and Zcash: How Do They Compare?                        ",Alex Sunnarborg,https://www.coindesk.com/the-structure-and-valuation-of-zcash-vs-bitcoin/,"Alex Sunnarborg is the founder of Lawnmower, a blockchain investing and market data platform founded in 2015. In this opinion piece, Sunnarborg compares bitcoin's attributes with those of the newly launched cryptocurrency Zcash, providing an overview of how he considers the market potential of each .  With the launch of Zcash today (and the speculation surrounding it) you may be wondering how the decentralized, open-source cryptocurrency compares to bitcoin, the original digital currency. While many structural similarities to Satoshi Nakamoto's bitcoin design are obvious, Zcash utilizes advanced new cryptographic techniques to offer optional improved privacy and transparency, as well as its own unique blockchain. But, despite the differences, there is common ground. Zcash's supply model is extremely similar to bitcoin's, with a fixed and known issuance model that is cut in half approximately every four years. As well, there is a maximum of 21m units of both Zcash (ZEC) and bitcoin (BTC) which will be mined over time. Given these similarities, it's easy to see why the price and market caps of the two assets are often compared. Nearly eight years after bitcoin's genesis block was formed, more than 15.75m BTC have already been mined (representing over 75% of the supply that will ever exist on its blockchain). Zcash's developers are now standing by to launch a similar cryptocurrency, albeit with some key differences.  Small changes to the blockchain and issuance structures mean ZEC will have a 2.5-minute average block time and an initial block reward of 12.5 ZEC. There will also be a ""slow-start"" period during the first 20,000 blocks (about 34 days) where the block reward linearly increases to 12.5 ZEC. This is designed to reduce the impact of a potential negative event like ""a major bug"" or ""security vulnerability"". As a result, the first blocks will reward extremely small amounts of ZEC, meaning the overall supply in the ecosystem will be limited as the block reward ramps up. Despite this, exchanges including Kraken and Poloniex have already announced they will be opening markets as soon as possible following the distribution of the first fractions of coins to miners and the network. As you can imagine, early exchange order books will likely display many buy orders for large quantities. The only initial sell orders will be small, as those first reduced block rewards are issued. In the days before its launch, derivatives exchange BitMEX already has a form of Zcash market open for traders before the first ZEC has even touched its blockchain. The futures contract it offers expires in about two months, on 30th December, and is based on the price of ZEC on that date as compared to bitcoin. The BitMEX price is currently 1.5 BTC, representing the market’s expectation that 1 ZEC will be worth 1.5 BTC on the above date, by which time about 330,000 ZEC will have been mined.  At bitcoin's current price of $685, a ZEC price of 1.5 BTC would imply a market cap of about $350m, which would make it one of the top five digital assets. Of course, the demand side of the market may be willing to pay a higher price per unit of BTC than ZEC on 30th December, but the psychological impact of the pair reaching parity is undoubtedly noteworthy. Additional trading has already also occurred in a form entirely different than anything seen in bitcoin's anonymous and decentralized issuance structure. Zcash was created by a public team and company (Zcash Electric Coin Company) with a slew of additional high-profile employees, advisors and investors. As additional incentives beyond equity in the company, many of these team members are also set to receive a portion of future ZEC block rewards in the mining process. Ten percent (2.1 million) of the 21 million ZEC to ever exist are set to be allocated to groups outside of the miners who successfully place a new block on the ZEC blockchain. Investors, employees, advisors, founders, the company (""as a ‘strategic reserve’ to fund new projects"") and the non-profit Zcash Foundation (created to ""maintain and improve the Zcash protocol in the interests of all users, present and future"") are all set to receive a specified portion of future block rewards over specified time periods.  The 2.1m ZEC will all be distributed over the first four years, and up until the point where 10.5m ZEC will have been mined, thus representing a distribution of 20% to parties other than miners.  After the first four years, the further 10.5m coins to be mined will be rewarded solely to miners. Zcash has also announced some additional details on its investors and previous fundraising structures. Its latest funding round of $2m was raised for 6.25% of the company, implying a valuation of $32m, while its previous round of $1m was raised for 10.15% of the company, implying a valuation of about $10m. Thus, the early investors paid about $1m for equity in the Zcash Electric Coin Company and 214,000 ZEC over the first year (about $4.66 per ZEC), while the most recent investors paid about $2m for equity and 132,000 ZEC (about $15.15 per ZEC). Another important concept to keep in mind with Zcash is the thought of the technology also being applied to other projects or protocols. There are even existing plans and talks around extending some of the functionality behind Zcash to ethereum, and possibly vice versa – bringing smart contract features to Zcash. Thus, the value of ZEC will obviously be based a multitude of factors, and consideration should be given to comparable and even competitive platforms and assets like BTC, ETH and future projects that can also adopt and iterate on these groundbreaking and open-source developments.

                            Father of Bitcoin Exchange Operator Pleads Guilty to Obstruction                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-exchange-guilty-obstruction/,"A Florida man pled guilty yesterday after being indicted in a case tied to the now-defunct Florida bitcoin exchange Coin.mx. Michael Murgio, father of Coin.mx operator Anthony Murgio, allegedly took part in a plan to gain control of a New Jersey credit union. That plan, according to prosecutors, involved paying off senior officials at the Hope Federal Credit Union, which has since been shuttered. The elder Murgio was arrested in April, and this week pled guilty to a charge of conspiracy to obstruct an examination of a federal financial institution. He faces as many as five years in prison. As reported by Reuters, Murgio admitted to writing a letter to credit union regulators in 2014 that contained false information. Coin.mx was shuttered last summer after its operators were charged with unlawful money transmission and money laundering. Federal prosecutors have tied the Coin.mx exchange to a wider plot to hack financial institutions two years ago, including JPMorgan. Those running the exchange were accused of acting as a financial conduit for a global cybercrime network – an allegation the defendants have denied. Michael Murgio previously served as a county school board member in Palm Beach, Florida, a position from which he resigned after he was indicted earlier this year, according to The Palm Beach Post. Others tied to the alleged credit union capture continue to face trial. Pastor Trevón Gross, who at the time as chairman of the credit union, was indicted in March for allegedly taking the bribes, though he has denied the charge. Another defendant, Yuri Lebedev, was accused of taking part in the alleged scheme but has also plead not guilty. Anthony Murgio has denied the allegations against him, and is expected to face trial early next year. He plead not guilty last November. Image via Shutterstock

                            Swiss Railway Service to Sell Bitcoin                        ",Stan Higgins,https://www.coindesk.com/swiss-railway-service-sell-bitcoin-ticket-kiosks/,"UPDATE (28th October 17:55 BST): This article has been updated with comment from SBB The operator of a national railway service in Switzerland will begin selling bitcoin through its ticket kiosks starting next month. SBB quietly unveiled the service on its website, set to begin on 11th November. Customers, who need to have a QR-code enabled bitcoin wallet and a valid Swiss mobile phone number, will be able to buy between CHF 20 and CHF 500 (up to roughly $500). Representatives for SBB did not immediately respond to a request for comment. But according to Swiss business newspaper Der Bund, SBB representatives confirmed the service, saying that it is working with a local payments startup called Sweepay. SBB later said in a statement: The railway operator further said that it plans to test demand for bitcoin sales over a two-year period. There will be limits to the service, according to the report. SBB won’t accept bitcoin payments for tickets, for example, and there will reportedly be a CHF 5000 annual cap on purchases, which isn’t listed on the website. SBB will also reportedly charge a 6% transaction fee at the time of purchase. The SBB trial perhaps reflects the cultural experiment taking place in some parts of Switzerland. In May, the city of Zug, Switzerland announced that it would accept bitcoin payments for public services. Financial firms in the country have also moved to test applications of blockchain, and last month, the chief of the Swiss central bank said that the system has been “turned on its head” by the technology.
