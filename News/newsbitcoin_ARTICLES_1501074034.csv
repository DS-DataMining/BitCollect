Also read: Abra Now Offers Deposits and Withdrawals at 60+ US Financial Institutions Bitcoin wallet and payments service provider Abra announced a new feature on Tuesday to let customers fund their Abra wallet using American Express (Amex) cards. The company explained: Users need to already have an Amex card to use this option and they cannot sign up for one within Abra. In its announcement, the company provides information on how customers can sign up for an American Express card online. Abra recently updated its fee schedule. The company advertises “no transfer fees. Plus, sending money using your bank account, Abra wallet balance or your Bitcoin wallet is always free.” However, adding funds via an Amex credit card has a 4% fee. Adding or withdrawing funds via an Abra teller also has a fee starting at 1.5%, that goes directly to the teller. “When you add funds using cash at an Abra Teller, the Teller charges a small service fee. Tellers set their own fees, which are visible within the Abra app, so you always know how much you are going to pay,” the company clarifies. Abra has also updated its transaction limits. Amex credit card deposits have a daily limit of $200 and a $1,000 monthly limit. Bank deposits and withdrawals have a $500 daily limit, a $1,000 weekly limit and a $2,000 monthly limit. However, Abra warns that “bank regulations may supersede Abra’s limits: please check with your financial institution.” Meanwhile, bitcoin deposits and withdrawals have no limit. Eligible cards are consumer cards issued by American Express or third-parties that are licensed to issue American Express-branded cards. American Express reloadable prepaid cards including Bluebird and American Express Serve cards are also eligible. Launched in 2015 and available worldwide earlier this year, the Abra smartphone app is a bitcoin wallet that shows the balance in the currency of the user’s choice. In addition to bitcoin, the Abra app currently supports over fifty currencies, the company detailed, adding that “even if your local currency is not supported, you can still use the Abra app for exchanges in any supported currency.” Only users themselves have access to their own private keys in Abra, even if the wallet’s balance is denominated in a fiat currency such as dollars or yen. Using smart contracts, Abra wallets can send or receive bitcoins to and from other Abra users and the network of human tellers for loading or cashing out in whichever currency the recipient requires. In April, Abra announced that users in the U.S. and the Philippines could start buying bitcoin via over 60 banks and credit unions in the U.S. In May, the company announced that customers can use Abra Tellers to make cash deposits and withdrawals in over 170 cities and 50 countries worldwide, including over 1,500 Tellers in the Philippines.

Although many Bitcoiners assumed the closure was due to law enforcement pressure the owner insists it is due to a change in his ideology. Also read: What Every Bitcoiner Should Know About ‘Bitcoin Cash’ Bitmixer.io is one of the most popular bitcoin mixing and tumbling services on the web and caters to large volumes of BTC. The service has been operating since 2014, and the platform was processing 65,000 BTC per month according to the operator of the site. Bitmixer provided digitally signed proof of every order and offered instant mixing with a big reserve. In addition to Bitmixer’s website on clearnet, the operation also had an official Tor mirror as well on the deep web. For over three years the tumbling service operated for those who wanted to mix quantities of bitcoins. Then on July 24, the sites operator announced, “the largest bitcoin mixer is about to stop working.”  “Despite the huge profit we earn, we are closing our activity,” explains Bitmixer. “Let me explain why. I’m bitcoin enthusiast since 2011. When we started this service, I was convinced that any Bitcoin user has a natural right to privacy. I was totally wrong. Now I grasp that Bitcoin is a transparent non-anonymous system by design. Blockchain is a great open book.”  The news comes shortly after the recent global law enforcement takedown of the Alphabay and Hansa darknet marketplaces. As soon as Bitmixer’s announcement was made, many people asked whether or not the organization was threatened by law enforcement. Lots of darknet customers and vendors use mixers to cover their tracks. Alongside this, lately bureaucrats worldwide are talking of banning these types of applications and frowning upon those who condone bitcoin tumblers. However, the operator of Bitmixer thinks that this is a ridiculous assumption.    “The government pressure doesn’t work like ‘Oh man, please close your service,’” Bitmixer responds. “No way. They just come and arrest you for illegal activity. We are privacy experts; it is hard or impossible to find out our location and personality, our servers are located in the country where Bitcoin is not considered as a currency. I could sell the business to our competitors for $5-6M, but I will not do this.”  A lot of people still didn’t believe the Bitmixer operator reasons but wished him luck for helping people mix coins. One person writes, “I don’t believe that he turned 180 degrees to anti-privacy — Anyhow, thanks for your service mate!”  What do you think about Bitmixer closing up shop for ideological reasons?

2017-07-25T17:30:40-04:00,Rothschild Investment Corporation Becomes Bitcoin Stakeholder,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/rothschild-investment-corporation-becomes-bitcoin-stakeholder/,"A major mainstream investment company, Rothschild Investment Corporation, has embraced cryptocurrency by investing in bitcoin. The company recently filed a holdings report that solidified this investment move. They bought shares of the GBTC, or the bitcoin investment trust, which acts as a share that tacks its value to bitcoin’s price.  Also read: What Every Bitcoiner Should Know About ‘Bitcoin Cash’ The Econotimes covered the facts: “According to the details provided, Rothschild Investment Corporation has acquired shares of Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) for $210,000.” The Bitcoin investment trust is a U.S. based securities exchange. For clarity, some people have misinterpreted Rothschild Investment Corporation as directly buying and storing bitcoin. In reality, they merely purchased shares of the trust, which holds “bitcoin on paper” in the traditional fashion, as publicly quoted securities. This allows investors to keep and hold the value of bitcoin without having to purchase the currency and hold it in a wallet. The Econotimes provided an explanation: Bitcoin shares began public trading via Bitcoin Investment trust on March of 2015. This move by Rothschild Investment Company represents a major mainstream player hedging bets on the future value of bitcoin. There were also rumors that Rothschild Investment Corporation was related to the Rothschild family. In various social media posts, people thought there was some kind of conspiracy or deal that Rothchild himself made for gaining shares of bitcoin. The conspiracy theorists believe the Illuminati and lizard rulers may be colluding to sabotage bitcoin. This turned out to be false, as the company has no relationship to the Rothschild family other than possessing its namesake. The tweets below should say “Rothschild Investment Corporation,” and not just Rothschild the person. The reason for confusion is clear, because the name is relatively common. Looks like the Illuminati are still waiting for their chance to enter the market.     Do you think bitcoin adoption from mainstream investment firms is good for the cryptocurrency ecosystem?

Also read: Indian Bitcoin Hotspot Bangalore Sees 50+ Merchants Added This Month Over the past year, a few wallet companies like the Blockchain wallet, Airbitz, Breadwallet, and a few others have added in-app bitcoin purchasing and selling. Now Bitpay is joining this group as the company has announced Coinbase and Glidera integration from within the Bitpay wallet. This means Bitpay wallet users can add to their wallet balances directly from in-app exchange connections. “The Bitpay app, gives you full control of your bitcoin’s private keys — Only you have access to your funds,” explains Bitpay’s announcement. To integrate this feature for Coinbase customers: users sign into their Coinbase accounts and go to the “next steps” section in the Bitpay wallet and choose “buy or sell bitcoin.” From there the user chooses “Coinbase” (or Glidera) and signs into their account from inside the app. After entering the two-factor authentication, Coinbase users must “authorize” the Bitpay wallet to access their Coinbase account and review the app’s permissions. Once the app has authorization, Bitpay wallet users can then purchase and sell bitcoin using these exchanges. Even though non-custodial wallets are secure, Bitpay says that the problem with most of them is they don’t offer a simple way to buy bitcoin from within the interface. The company thinks it’s only natural to allow users to add to their wallet balances directly from in-app exchange connections.

2017-07-25T07:47:37-04:00,What Every Bitcoiner Should Know About ‘Bitcoin Cash’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/what-every-bitcoiner-should-know-about-bitcoin-cash/,"In a few days the notorious August 1st is approaching, and it’s likely this day will be remembered for a long time. This week Bitcoin.com discussed the possible scenario of a user activated hard fork called “Bitcoin Cash” as much of the community doesn’t realize this fork will likely still happen despite Segwit2x’s current progress. Also read: India Fights Over Which Government Body Will Regulate Bitcoin Bitcoin Cash is a token that may exist in the near future due to a user-activated hard fork (UAHF) that will bifurcate the Bitcoin blockchain into two branches. The UAHF was initially a contingency plan against the user-activated soft fork (UASF) announced by the bitcoin company Bitmain Technologies. Since this announcement, at the “Future of Bitcoin” conference a developer named Amaury Séchet revealed the Bitcoin ABC” (Adjustable Blocksize Cap) project and told the audience about the upcoming UAHF.  Following Séchet’s announcement and after Bitcoin ABC’s first client release, the project “Bitcoin Cash” (BCC) was announced. Bitcoin Cash will be pretty much the same as BTC minus a few things, like the Segregated Witness (Segwit) implementation and the Replace-by-Fee (RBF) feature. According to BCC, a few of the biggest differences between BTC and BCC will be three new additions to the bitcoin codebase that include; Bitcoin Cash will have support from various members of the cryptocurrency industry including miners, exchanges, and clients like Bitcoin ABC, Unlimited, and Classic will also be assisting the project. In addition to this help, Bitcoin Cash developers have added a ‘slow’ mining difficulty reduction algorithm just in case there’s not enough hashrate to support the chain. So far several of the biggest bitcoin mining pools have stated that there’s a possibility they may direct hashrate towards the Bitcoin Cash chain. This includes Bitmain’s Antpool, BTC.top, Viabtc, and Connect BTC. Bitmain states via the company’s blog that for now the firm is focusing its efforts on Segwit2x and running that specific software. However, the company states, “we are closely observing the ‘BCC’ movement and do not rule out the possibility of supporting both Segwit2x and BCC.” At the moment Bitmain seems to be observing the situation until it makes its final decision. Our mining operation, pool.bitcoin.com has also released a public service announcement on Bitcoin Cash, and like Bitmain, our pool will also watch the events unfold as well. “We continue to remain committed to supporting the Segwit2x proposal, which has received broad support from Bitcoin industry and community alike — However, due to significant demand from our users, the Bitcoin.com Pool will give mining customers the option of supporting the Bitcoin Cash chain (BCC) with their hashrate, but otherwise Bitcoin.com Pool will by default remain pointed at the chain supporting Segwit2x (BTC).” Bitcoin.com previously reported on Viabtc adding a BCC futures market to their exchange’s listed coins. The token has been trading at roughly $450-550 over the past 24-hours and reached an all time high of $900 when first released. Two other exchanges, Okcoin via the ‘OKEX’ platform and Livecoin have also announced they will also be listing BCC on their trading platforms. Bitcoin Cash supporters expect more exchanges to follow shortly after the fork is complete.  As we’ve explained in all of our other updates concerning the possibility of a fork — users should always maintain their private keys. Keeping sole custody of your keys will ensure that you can get access to Bitcoin Cash tokens in the event of a split. Keeping funds on an exchange will be different, as you always surrender your funds to the trading platform’s discretion when leaving cryptocurrencies on exchanges. This means you will have to follow their rules as many exchanges plan to halt withdrawals, deposits and possibly trading on August 1. Further, there are exchanges that will not support the UAHF split and the Bitcoin Cash token, including businesses like Coinbase and GDAX. Both Trezor and Ledger hardware wallet manufacturers have stated that their customers won’t have to do anything to receive BCC tokens. Again, regardless of Segwit2x’s progress this fork most likely will happen and bitcoiners should be prepared. There are a few days left until August 1 and those looking to acquire Bitcoin Cash should remove their coins from third parties into a wallet they control.

The bill exempts bitcoin from regulatory action and prevents New Hampshire bitcoin businesses from having to register as a money transmitter. The bill flies in the face of previous New Hampshire regulation that targeted bitcoin for harsh regulation. The bill was signed by New Hampshire governor John Sununu on June 2.  Also read: Suspension Lifted: Japanese Exchanges and Merchants Resume Bitcoin Services  Bitcoin.com wrote about the bill back in June, saying, “The bill provides bitcoin with clear protection from debilitating and Orwellian regulations. The bill states that anyone who uses a “virtual currency” is exempt from having to register as a money transmitter. This is important news for a State that vouches for being one of the freest places to live in the U.S. ” Previously in New Hampshire, a bill was introduced that added bitcoin to the money transmitter status. As a bill that reduced people’s economic freedom, this piece of legislation came as sort of an embarrassment to local activists. However, it appears the activists and politicians who supported it simply were not prepared. Ian Freeman, writing for Free Keene, expressed this view: Even though HB436 is now being passed with enthusiasm and joy across most of the State, not everyone in government agreed with the bill. The House of Representatives and Senate in New Hampshire were divided. Their decision was based on a 185 to 170 vote. Allegedly, several bankers and New Hampshire officials spoke against the bill, saying it would impede their jobs, making it more difficult to detect fraud and apprehend criminals.  Is a deregulated Bitcoin a good thing? Do you think other States will follow the example set by New Hampshire? Let us know in the comments section below.

Ledgerx plans to start trading bitcoin options in the fall and ether options a few months after that. Also read: Ledgerx Receives Federal Approval as a Regulated Bitcoin Swap Exchange Founded in 2013, institutional bitcoin derivatives trading and clearing platform Ledgerx has been approved by the CFTC as a fully-regulated bitcoin options exchange and clearinghouse. The Commission approved the company as a Swap Execution Facilities (SEF) early this month and then, on Monday, as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO). Ledgerx has become the first digital currency platform to be both a SEF and a DCO. The Commission announced on Monday: Ledgerx CEO Paul Chou conveyed to Reuters that it took the Commission more than two years to grant his company the two statuses, due to a long education process. He has also been a member of the CFTC’s Technology Advisory Committee. In May, the company received funding of $11.4 million led by Miami International Holdings Inc and Huiyin Blockchain Venture Investments. Ledgerx plans to launch bitcoin options in the early fall, and ether options “within a few months,” Chou told CNBC. “Initially, Ledgerx expects to list one- to six-month option contracts for bitcoin. Other digital currency contracts such as ethereum (ETH) options are expected to follow,” he told Reuters. “Having a regulated clearinghouse will open the market to a lot of other investors such as large institutions,” Reuters quoted Chou saying, adding that a proper regulatory framework will make institutional investors comfortable and open the market up to them. He further commented: In an interview with CNBC, he said “we’re really excited to welcome a whole host of parties that traditionally have been very retail-oriented.” Furthermore, he expects “very large asset managers to enter the space” as a result of the CFTC’s approval. In addition, the CFTC has granted Ledgerx an exemption from Section 39 of the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commission wrote, “in response to a request from Ledgerx, the Commission’s Division of Clearing and Risk also today issued a letter exempting Ledgerx from complying with certain Commission regulations due to Ledgerx’s fully-collateralized clearing model.” Without this exemption, Ledgerx as a clearinghouse would have to undertake monthly stress tests of its financial resources “to ensure that it could withstand the default of its largest participant,” Waters Technology explained. Chou told CNBC that the exemption was due to his company’s plan to “not allow very leveraged trading.” Do you think Ledgerx’s platform will bring institutional investors to bitcoin?

The exchange originally planned to resume its bitcoin services at 16:00 on July 25, but will now resume on July 24 at 16:00. Along with their bitcoin merchant service providers, Japanese retailers and restaurants that accept bitcoin payments also stopped accepting the cryptocurrency during that time. NHK reported on the 23rd that along with bitcoin exchanges, “at restaurants and other places where payments can be made with bitcoins, the service cannot be used at this time.” Among them is Numazuko Ginza sushi restaurant in Tokyo, which had to notify customers visiting the restaurant that the bitcoin payment option was not available after Coincheck suspended its merchant services, the publication detailed. Restaurant manager Ken Nagahama has seen a rise in customers wanting to pay with the digital currency over the past few months. He said “I think that this is a useless measure for improving Bitcoin, and I hope that stability will continue,” the news outlet quoted him saying. The JCBA and its bitcoin exchange members will still suspend bitcoin services on August 1.

There is not one specific reason why the Nigerian bitcoin trade has grown so rapidly, but there are clues. The Nigerian people do not necessarily have faith in fiat currency anymore. They also desire more economic freedom. A Quartz article expanded: Many African countries like Nigeria are growing more rapidly than others like Tanzania. However, Tanzania appears to be just now embracing the bitcoin fever. Trading via localbitcoin.com has skyrocketed. A little over 83 billion Tanzanian Shillings have been traded this month.

Leading Indian bitcoin exchange Unocoin is based in the city, and has been helping merchants accept bitcoin there. Bitcoin.com talked to CEO Sathvik Vishwanath about the bitcoin economy in Bangalore and throughout India. Also read: India Fights Over Which Government Body Will Regulate Bitcoin Southern Indian city Bangalore, officially known as Bengaluru, is India’s third most populous city, with about 8.42 million people. Many merchants in the area accept bitcoin through the Bangalore-based Unocoin, one of the largest bitcoin exchanges in the country, which also provides merchant services. Early this month, the company reported that it had surpassed 300,000 registered users. The platform also processes more than 200 million INR every month, according to CEO and co-founder Sathvik Vishwanath. He told Bitcoin.com that the total number of merchants accepting bitcoin in his city is “about 400 now,” adding that: The use of bitcoin in Bangalore is widespread, Business Standard recently described, adding that products and services that can be purchased with bitcoin in the city include bus tickets, meals, e-shopping vouchers, and getting a haircut. Some of Unocoin’s merchants include India’s largest book mall Sapna online, India’s first travel portal to accept bitcoin Etravel Smart, mobile DTH data card Reload, hosting services Indsoft and Cyberls, Tecdoc365, Flight Shop, Dharwad International School, The Curators for Creativity, People Place Training & Recruitment, Epaisa, and gift cards and voucher marketplace Nafa. “While the traction for adopting bitcoin as a mode of payment saw a dip at the start of this year, it has picked up since then,” Vishwanath told Bitcoin.com. “I think the media is doing quite a good job in letting people know what this technology is all about.” However, most merchants signing up to accept bitcoin through his company have been in Bangalore. Merchant adoption in other parts of the country is lower “as we do not have a physical presence there and this needs quite a bit of explanation and push for the merchant to consider accepting bitcoin as a mode of payment,” he detailed. In Bangalore, Unocoin has also been educating and raising awareness about the digital currency. They have been running a Bitcoin meetup group since 2012. The group has 3,227 members currently with 67 past meetups. Attendees learn about and discuss topics such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and blockchain technology. “India started on bitcoin quite late. Also Indians are quite risk averse to flock on to something before it has seen global validation,” Vishwanath shared, adding that the government considering legalizing bitcoin has a positive effect on bitcoin adoption in the country. “There has been quite a bit of news about the positive regulations coming for bitcoin which is adding up as well.” The government is currently in discussions about how to best regulate bitcoin. A task force has been formed to evaluate the situation and come up with recommendations, which is expected to take 6 months. The Supreme Court has also weighed in and ordered the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to report on the risks of digital currencies in four weeks. Eventually, if India decides to regulate bitcoin, it could fall under the jurisdiction of the RBI or the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI). Nonetheless, the legalization of bitcoin “would be seen quite positive by the entire country,” Vishwanath believes, adding that: What do you think of Bitcoin adoption in Bangalore?

Some of its 13 bitcoin exchange members have already issued preliminary notices detailing how they will deal with the upcoming cryptocurrency. Also read: Viabtc Launching Bitcoin Cash Token and Mining Pool for Bitcoin ABC The Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA) released its plan on Friday regarding how it will deal with the planned hard fork on August 1. The association currently has 13 members that are bitcoin exchanges. All of them haveÂ already agreed to suspend bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on that date. The JCBA wrote: A bitcoin exchange member of the association, Bit Trade, described that âThe BCC hard fork is scheduled for August 1 (Tue) 21: 20 (JST).â The JCBA explained that, with the newly formed blockchain, an equal amount of Bitcoin Cash to each customerâs existing bitcoin holdings will be generated. The association added that each bitcoin exchange in the group will decide for themselves how to deal with Bitcoin Cash belonging to their customers. Some exchanges will not be trading BCC and customers of those exchanges will have to transfer them to another exchange that does, the association advised, adding that (loosely translated): Some bitcoin exchange members of the association have independently made their own announcements concerning how they plan to deal with Bitcoin Cash. However, so far, little information has been offered by each exchange. BitpointÂ wrote that they intend to âdeal with the newly generated Bitcoin Cash including trading transactions.â Bit TradeÂ hasÂ stated its policies in more detail. âWhen the Bitcoin Cash fork splits bitcoin into two coins, we will give the full number of coins same as BTC held by customer at the time of suspension, after August 2.â After that date, customers can withdraw money as well as trade the BCC/JPY or BCC/BTC trading pairs on the exchange. Coincheck wrote only that “we will consider how we cope withÂ Bitcoin Cash hard fork after confirming the situation in detail.” GMO-Z Coin similarly announced, “regarding the handling policy for ‘Bitcoin Cash’, we will inform you on our site and via email by August 1.” Tokyo Bitcoin Exchange wrote that “as for the plan to handle Bitcoin Cash transactions, we will not decide at the present time.â However, the exchange will aid individual customers with the withdrawals of the new coins.

2017-07-23T06:00:15-04:00,India Fights Over Which Government Body Will Regulate Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/india-government-body-regulate-bitcoin/,"As the Indian government discusses the regulatory framework for digital currencies such as bitcoin, a disagreement over which regulatory body should be in charge erupts. While the Reserve Bank of India suggests that bitcoin is a commodity, the Securities and Exchange Board of India disagrees. Also read: India’s Supreme Court Seeks Answers as Bitcoin Legalization Focus Turns to Taxation In a recent meeting hosted by the finance ministry to discuss the regulatory framework of digital currencies including bitcoin, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) fought over who would regulate the digital currency. “SEBI, RBI engage in turf war over Bitcoin regulation,” Business Standard described on Friday. The RBI believes that bitcoin is a security rather than a currency and should be regulated by SEBI, the publication detailed, adding that the central bank proposed it should trade as commodity derivatives, similar to gold or silver. The RBI also recommended for SEBI to ensure that bitcoin is not used for any illegal activities like money laundering or terror funding. SEBI opposes the central bank’s proposal, the publication noted, and then quoted a regulatory official saying: The publication also reported that a number of legal experts believe that bitcoin cannot be categorized as commodity. “Commodities are usually well-known items and maintain accountability. How will bitcoin, which has no existence, fit in the category?,” asked RS Loona, managing partner at Dhaval Vussonji Alliance. “The government needs to come out with the legal definition and terms before putting into any category.” The RBI’s push for SEBI to regulate bitcoin came after it had been criticized for not taking enough action against the use of digital currencies in India. A public interest litigation (PIL) was filed in the Supreme Court against the government and concerned ministry over bitcoin usage and increasing popularity. “Since bitcoin has no government control or government guarantee,” this petition seeks a ban on it, explained Ndtv News. After hearing the petition, the Supreme Court ordered the RBI “to look into the complaint seeking its intervention to take urgent steps for restraining the sale and purchase of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin,” Business Standard described. Meanwhile, the industry is in favor of self-regulation. Zebpay co-founder Sandeep Goenka said that the Indian Bitcoin economy would most benefit from the creation of a self-regulatory body rather than burdening regulators like SEBI, The Hindu reported on Saturday. He suggested for the industry to form a self-regulatory organization (SRO) similar to the Mutual Fund Association of India, Internet & Mobile Association of India, or the Payment Council of India, noting that: Meanwhile, India already has an industry association for digital currency, called the Digital Assets and Blockchain Foundation India (Dabfi). It was founded in February by Unocoin, Zebpay, Coinsecure, and Searchtrade, after the RBI issued a warning against digital currencies. The association is currently working closely with lawyers to set up regulatory guidelines for digital currency, Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath recently told Bitcoin.com, adding that Dabfi is “making sure that the present members are adhering to self-regulatory guidelines.” Do you think India should consider bitcoin a commodity, a currency, or let it be self-regulated?

2017-07-22T04:55:58-04:00,How Time-locked Bitcoins Could Incentivize Smooth Hard Forks,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-time-locked-bitcoins-could-incentivize-smooth-hard-forks/,"There’s been a lot going on as far as development goes with the latest alternative clients and the Segwit2x plan also known as BTC1 on Github. One particular subject that came up on the BTC1 repository was the idea to incentivize the development community with time-locked bitcoins to smoothly activate a hard fork. Also read: The Bitcoin Scaling Countdown: Miners Begin Running Segwit2x Software The hard fork has gotten a bad name over time mostly because of the contentious fork that took place with the Ethereum network. Hard forks aren’t forward-compatible, which means that the entire ecosystem of miners, wallet providers, exchanges, and merchants need to upgrade to the new code. The Segwit2x plan aims to activate Segregated Witness (Segwit) and follow up with a hard fork a few months down the line. This week Oleg Andreev, product architect of the blockchain network company Chain introduced Issue #72 to the Github repo called “Time-locked incentive for Bitcoin hard fork.” The scheme Andreev says is to incentivize the community with coins that cannot be spent for a period of time until after the completion of a successful hardfork. The idea comes at a time when Segwit2x offers a compromise of both Segwit and a 2MB hard fork, but the problem is some people think the second part of the agreement won’t be fulfilled.     “It is well-known that cryptocurrency development can be incentivized by long-term time-locked coins,” explains Andreev. “Meaning, that the coins cannot be spent in the peak of a bubble, or right before a disaster that was not prevented or worked around. For instance, Greg Maxwell claims that Blockstream uses such scheme.” Time-locked bitcoins cannot be spent until a specified time or block height by using a distributed contract recorded on the blockchain. Over the years there have been added improvements to this type of time-locking infrastructure with code development like Check-Lock-Time-Verify, Relative locktime, and Check-Sequence-Verify. Bitcoin luminary and author Andreas Antonopoulos discusses the subject of time-locked bitcoins in his book “Mastering Bitcoin: Programming the Open Blockchain.” Moreover, in 2016 Thomas McCabe gave instructions on how he successfully spent a time-locked bitcoin transaction. “Bitcoin’s scripting language is very powerful, but access to resources with regards to learning how to build a script is scarce,” details McCabe.  Chain engineer Andreev believes this technology could smooth the process of completing a successful hard fork.  “Considering that any hard fork by definition carries an increased systemic risk: from producing chain splits inadvertently (due to overlooked software incompatibility), to splitting the market and shattering the faith in the technology and perspectives of our social experiment.” Andreev gives specifications to his idea, and a few other developers including Jeff Garzik thought the concept was interesting. Additionally, Andreev’s proposal offers forward compatibility and “the code is expected to be modified to preserve the spirit of the proposal for the future hard forks,” explains the developer. Adding an incentive to smoothly activate a fork or fund bitcoin development, in general, is a unique concept but it’s likely this plan won’t be included in the Segwit2x working group’s current roadmap. There are multiple comments and suggestions made by developers that won’t make the final cut including funny ones like finding the Mt Gox missing bitcoins.

2017-07-21T19:05:06-04:00,Thousands of Japanese Stores May Suspend Bitcoin Payments on August 1,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-stores-suspend-bitcoin-payments-august-1/,"Over 5,000 retail stores and restaurants across Japan that currently accept bitcoin payments may suspend bitcoin use in their stores on August 1 if their bitcoin payment processors halt services. Also read: 13 Japanese Exchanges Agree to Suspend Bitcoin Service on August 1 Ever since the Japanese government started recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment, a large and growing number of retail stores and restaurants have started accepting the cryptocurrency. However, “some Japanese retailers and restaurants that accept bitcoin are considering halting transactions using the digital currency, which faces a potential split amid competing plans for its future,” according to Nikkei on Thursday. Restaurant chain Heichinrou and leading electronics retail chain Bic Camera accept bitcoin payments through Bitflyer, Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume. They are both planning to stop accepting bitcoin should Bitflyer shut down its services, the publication detailed. In addition, Nikkei reported that e-commerce site Bitcoinmall, which accepts digital currencies, is also considering suspending bitcoin transactions for several days beginning on August 1. “We will rely instead on monacoin and other virtual currencies for a while,” said Bitchange, the company which operates the site. Monacoin is an altcoin that has gained popularity in Japan. Over 5,000 retail stores and restaurants accept bitcoin payments through either Bitflyer or Coincheck which offer payment services for merchants. Bitflyer recently helped Bic Camera stores roll out a bitcoin payment option nationwide. Meanwhile, Coincheck claims to have helped over 5,000 stores accept the cryptocurrency and is in the process of helping over 260,000 stores nationwide accept bitcoin through a partnership with Recruit Lifestyle. Earlier this month, the two partners started rolling out bitcoin payments, starting with eyeglasses retail chain Meganesuper which has 334 locations. Bitflyer posted a notice on Wednesday, stating that it may halt bitcoin deposits and withdrawals as well as its payment services on July 31 at 22:00 Japan time until about August 2. Coincheck separately announced on Tuesday: However, on Thursday the possibility of a network split was significantly reduced as the scaling compromise for Segregated Witness (Segwit) was locked in with a strong consensus. Nonetheless, the exchanges are still prepared to suspend bitcoin services, should a network split occur. Coincheck announced on Friday that “it is highly likely that ‘Bitcoin Cash‘ hard fork will happen around 9:20 pm (JST) on August 1st, 2017.” In addition, “On July 23, 2017, the event of a fork of the Bitcoin protocol may happen. Initially, it was intended to happen on August 1st, but it may happen faster than anticipated,” the exchange added. However, the suspension of services will not happen if Coincheck decides that a Bitcoin fork will not take place. Retailers are expected to see little impact from halting bitcoin payments, since most of their business is conducted in cash or credit card, Nikkei concluded.

2017-07-21T12:30:24-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin Bulls Are Back With Vigorous Energy,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoin-bulls-are-back-with-vigorous-energy/,"July 20 was an exciting day for bitcoin proponents as markets suddenly switched from a bear crawl to a full fledged bull charge. The price spike resulted in a high of US$2930 per BTC across many global exchanges, showing a huge price difference between the recent low into the $1850s last week. Also read: Global Police Operation Undermines Darknet Markets Bitcoin markets had a spectacular day on July 20 as the decentralized currency came real close to reaching $3K per BTC. At the time of writing, the price was hovering around $2750-2770. The digital currency has been experiencing a recent break-out since reaching a low of $1850 per BTC on July 16. The initial drop was attributed to fear and uncertainty concerning a possible bitcoin split on August 1. Now speculators are crediting the recent jump in price to the BIP91 lock-in and the possibility of Segregated Witness (Segwit) activation. Trade volume has increased over the past three days as bitcoin markets are now seeing 24-hour trade volumes cross over $2 billion. Moreover, bitcoin’s market capitalization dominance against altcoin markets has risen to 48 percent. Bitcoin charts and order books across exchanges are looking healthy at the moment. Looking at the charts over the past 48 hours the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) crossed over the long term 200 SMA showing bulls will continue to try and push past resistance levels. The gap between these two averages on July 21 is pretty decent considering the price downfall five days ago.  Using Fibonacci retracement after yesterday’s high above $2900 indicates we may see resistance points again above that price range. The stochastic and relative strength Index (RSI) reveal similar stories as both suggest more profit taking may occur, and there’s likely to be more volatility. Further, on Bitstamp and a few other popular exchanges, there are gigantic sell walls around the $3K territory. Overall cryptocurrency markets, in general, are all in the green as many altcoins are experiencing pumps from bitcoin’s 20 percent price rise in the last 24 hours. Ethereum markets, which still hold the second largest market capitalizations, are seeing a less climactic rebound up only a few percentages. At the moment ethereum is $227 per ETH with a market cap of roughly $21B.  Ripple (XRP) is up about 3 percent at $0.18 per XRP after seeing a significant decline last week. Litecoin (LTC) is up 5 percent and has managed to hold a token value of over $45 per LTC. The number five position is held by Ethereum Classic (ETC) which is currently hovering at $16 per ETC at press time. The rest of the top ten is also seeing small percentage increases as well. Dash is $190 per token, NEM $0.14, IOTA $0.29, Monero $41, and Stratis is $5.80. Notably, Stratis markets have done just as well as bitcoin, increasing 20 percent over the past 24 hours. For now, the cryptocurrency ‘community’ seems relatively optimistic due to the current market rebound and the progress happening with the Segwit2x roadmap. Since the network’s mining pools joined together to enact BIP91, the price coincided with the approaching lock-in activity. However, the rise to $2930 as BIP91 locked-in was short lived as the price dropped to sub-$2700 about an hour and a half later. The price has also stayed resilient during the recent darknet markets busts as global law enforcement announced on July 20 the official takedown of Alphabay and Hansa.  Bear Scenario: The scaling compromise is not set in stone, and other less positive events could take place this coming week. It’s likely the price will be quite volatile over the next few days, and day-traders should do quite well in this environment. Currently, looking at order books, there’s a solid foundation in the $2400-2500 range that should hold for the time being. If these zones are broken due to negative news or some kind of market phenomena, then we could approach the $2000 levels again. Bull Scenario: After Thursday’s incredible bull run it’s quite possible bitcoin could surpass $3K per BTC in the near future. However, there will be large sell offs in that price territory, but the price could go higher if buyers manage to chew through resistance. Bitcoin markets and overall trade volume is doing quite well, and BTC markets should continue to be very active this week. At press time bulls have to break the resistance past the $2800s and above to see some smooth sailing, and all-time highs once again. Where do you see the price going from here?

Loerien Gamaroff, CEO of Bankymoon, has revealed that his company has been selected as the first business to trial the new regulations. Also Read: Increased South African Bitcoin Adoption Highlights Need for Taxation Clarity  South Africa is taking significant steps toward solidifying a regulatory framework for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has announced that it will begin to trial a number of regulations pertaining to virtual currencies. South Africa has been among the slowest of the advanced economies to begin to develop a juridical apparatus for cryptocurrencies, garnering criticism for failing to embrace virtual currencies and blockchain technology sooner. Loerien Gamaroff, CEO of blockchain services company Bankymoon, has revealed that his company will be the subject of a trial of SARB’s preliminary regulations. Gamaroff confirmed that he has had consistent contact with The South African Reserve Bank in discussing the regulatory sandbox, and has conducted several seminars pertaining to potential use cases for cryptocurrency within the South African economy. Gamaroff also revealed his involvement with government-directed research into alternative cryptocurrencies. “All we are doing at this point is seeing how far this relationship will go on within this sandbox,” Gamaroff stated. “This is because the Reserve Bank is very hesitant to give a stamp of approval on anything that comes out. The sandbox will only be Bitcoin-focused during this initial phase, but is focused on applying broad regulations to all cryptocurrencies,” he said.  Gamaroff has expressed his belief that regulations are ultimately positive for cryptocurrency, and will be vital in attaining legitimacy for virtual currency use in South Africa. “I think the regulation will move things along and make people on the street comfortable with Bitcoin. With these new regulations, these everyday people can now trust that Bitcoin is not just for hackers and criminals,” Gamaroff said. In February, SARB announced intentions to develop a national virtual currency that would based on distributed ledger technology. SARB also described plans to carry out research regarding the feasibility of cryptocurrency and blockchain adoption within South Africa. The announcements come amidst growing acceptance of cryptocurrency technology within South Africa. Michael Jordaan, the former CEO of First National Bank, recently stated his support for cryptocurrencies, and belief that they will one day come to rival fiat currencies. P2P trading volume has also enjoyed consistent growth in recent months. Do you think that Bankymoon will enjoy an unfair ‘headstart’ over its competitors within the South African cryptocurrency industry through being the sole company involved in the trial of SARB’s regulations?

For example, RSK is developing a specific learning program to address decision makers’ educational needs, as well as a blockchain program geared to address technicians’ needs. Moreover, jointly with Funzi, RSK is planning to provide Bitcoin technology education on mobile devices. Also read: Learning Cryptography Through Bitcoin’s Proof of Existence Feature Bitcoin’s rate of adoption increases as decision-makers, software developers, business leaders, and the general public become better acquainted with the virtues of the cryptocurrency. Thus, education related to Bitcoin and its blockchain technology is critical to increase and sustain its global adoption. Academia and individuals using social media are developing programs and tools to provide instruction on Bitcoin technology. The business world, especially businesses focusing on cryptocurrencies, is also developing amazing educational initiatives. A Bitcoin user requires at least some basic understanding of what Bitcoin is. The more an individual becomes familiar with the complexities and virtues of the cryptocurrency, the more likely he or she is to embrace Bitcoin and benefit from the opportunities it offers. Courses focusing on Bitcoin technology are flourishing as the value of the cryptocurrency continues its upward trend, according to CourseIndex.com. Additionally, the number of tools and teaching resources is increasing. Soon, millions will be able to learn about Bitcoin and its blockchain technology using their mobile phones. In effect, RSK University and Funzi are joining forces to deliver educational material on blockchain and smart contracts via mobile devices, through the Funzi’s mobile learning app. This will probably be one of the first distributed ledger technology (DLT) training courses delivered to your hand. RSK University is a platform to study smart contract and blockchain technology. Fuzi is a prominent Finnish company providing mobile learning services. The partnership will expand the universe of resources available to people who want to learn about the cryptocurrency technology. “We truly believe in the need of breaking down the concepts behind these technologies and their benefits for people to start adopting it,” stated Henry Sraigman, Head of Business Development at RSK. RSK and Funzi also see huge opportunities to empower people in the developing world. Specifically, Funzi and RSK, through its Ambassador University programs, are already exploring synergies to deliver educational programs in Africa. The RSK University will be launched sometime in September 2017, according to Sraigman. Educational resources to learn about the cryptocurrency and its technology keep on growing. Several colleges and universities have long ago recognized the importance of Bitcoin. They have been developing and delivering courses on Bitcoin for several years. For example, New York University started delivering courses in 2014. Princeton University created one of the most popular courses, Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies, which is delivered online through Coursera. Hundreds of articles and academic papers are being published daily. Meetups, conferences, and workshops are being organized all over the world, while even more information is divulged via social media. Bitcoin education via social media also continues to gain momentum. For example, Youtube provides Bitcoin educational content reaching millions of people throughout the world. These videos provide information to the beginners as well as to the sophisticated Bitcoin user. To minimize Bitcoin adoption resistance, communication and education are critical. Therefore, it is encouraging to note how many resources are available to boost Bitcoin’s rate of adoption. What do you think about minimizing Bitcoin adoption resistance through education?

2017-07-21T03:30:47-04:00,Do Not Make Bitcoin Price Predictions Lest You Eat Your Words,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/predicting-bitcoin-markets-is-near-impossible/,"There has been a lot of fear, doubt, and panic sweeping through the cryptocurrency world the last few days. Many people made doom and gloom bitcoin price predictions, especially this last Sunday when the price went into a bomb-propelled plunge. People and media sources said this could herald the end of bitcoin or suggest the “bubble” had popped. However, just a few days later, the price started to skyrocket again, vexing naysayers and overturning shortsighted predictions. Looks like they ate their words. Also read: Global Police Operation Undermines Darknet Markets For perspective, lets analyze recent price movement in greater detail. Prior to last weekend, the price was hovering healthily in the upper $2,000 range and flirting with a $3,000 peak. As the weekend rolled around, the price began to plummet. This occurred in lockstep with fearful signals that the bitcoin community would not be able to reach consensus on the scaling debate. So during the wee hours of Sunday, the price dropped roughly 10% to a devastating $1851.49, a record low in recent weeks. During the price downturn, media sources exacerbated fear by writing clickbait headlines to scare people into a panicked frenzy. CBS news wrote on July 14, “Did a Bitcoin Bubble just Burst”? On July 17 Fortune wrote “Wipeout: Bitcoin and Other Digital Currencies in Price Collapse.” Along with a slew of provocative — yet preemptive — media posts about bitcoin’s imminent collapse or demise…individual users on Facebook and elsewhere spoke of selling their coin and panicking. They embraced the panic and met it with equal parts fear and uncertainty. Here are a few quotes from my personal Facebook feed: One user even misinterpreted bitcoin as fiat currency during the price movement: “bitcoin is crashing, lol. fiat currency is no good, even digital ones. gold is the standard.” There were many other posts about bitcoin collapsing or dying, but as everyone witnessed, the price made a significant turn and started an upward trend. As of writing this, Bitcoin just surpassed the $2,750 mark with a high of around $2,900. It looks like the ecosystem could be making a recovery. As a result of this staggering change in price, I urge people not to listen to FUD predictions, unless they know factually that something has broken bitcoin or harmed its infrastructure. If they do make these FUD predictions, and the opposite comes true, they may have the unsavory task of eating their words.  Here is why: people cannot accurately predict markets anymore than they can accurately predict the path of a tornado. Cryptocurrency markets are notoriously more difficult to guess at than other markets as well, because the constant fluctuation of price points and random behavior of market actors can cause the price to shift on a dime. To wit, I am not making a prediction myself. I am not saying without doubt bitcoin will win or end up at $500,000 mark, like John McAfee predicted. I have utmost faith in bitcoin and its diligent community, even regarding technical and political challenges; however, I know enough about markets to realize they are basically unpredictable. Not even astute technical analysis leveraging Fibonacci retracement can always provide accurate analysis for investors. I admit, I made predictions in the past. Some came true and some did not. I realized applying arbitrary, subjective guesswork to crypto markets is likely doomed to failure. I usually just end up wrong or dumbstruck. Worst case scenario is a FUD prediction could precipitate a temporary panic sell. In psychology, this panic sell would result in a domino effect predicated on a self-fulfilling prophecy. A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between belief and behavior. On the market, a catastrophic prediction by various organizations or individuals could elicit a panic sell that results in the expected belief of the actors. This is probably what happened on bloody Sunday as media sources yipped and howled about bitcoin crashing. It didn’t of course, but bitcoin could eventually undergo serious problems. The digital currency is not guaranteed to win, but predictions are oftentimes wrong. They do not really do justice to all market variables. Try to withhold making predictions unless there are solid facts to support them. Otherwise, loose predictions could provide false market signals and exacerbate panics. Do not be part of that. Do not have to eat your words. Do you believe making cryptocurrency predictions is a good thing? Are they ever accurate? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-07-21T01:06:48-04:00,Bitcoin Mining Pools Initiate Segwit Lock-in Period,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mining-pools-initiate-segwit-lock-in-period/,"At approximately 00:06:48 UTC today, July 20, at block height #476768 the bitcoin network finished the BIP91 lock in period and entered a new phase in order to activate the protocol Segregated Witness (Segwit). Now during the lock-in period, there will be another 336 blocks, until Segwit will be activated on Bitcoin’s main network. Also read: Predicting the August 1 Split Flow Chart the Hard Way It seems the Bitcoin network may see the implementation of Segwit in the near future. Miners have reached the 80 percent threshold and held this position for 336 blocks to initiate the current lock-in. Another period of blocks mined at this threshold must take place in order to activate the protocol. During the morning of July 20 bitcoin markets have rallied from a price of $2300 per BTC the day before, to a high of $2930. Many bitcoin proponents across forums and social media believe the price spike is due to the anticipated lock-in and activation. Segwit is a protocol that was introduced in 2015 by bitcoin developer Pieter Wuille at the Hong Kong Scaling Workshop. The implementation creates a mechanism that relocates witness inputs away from transactions which in turn may create more block space. Full nodes will validate blocks but with a separate entry for signature data. Essentially, because this specific data is removed, supporters believe it can free up block size space to achieve more on-chain throughput.    The code was prepared a long time ago, and network participants failed to get it activated and also had to deal with a higher threshold of 95 percent. Moreover, many bitcoin proponents believe Segwit isn’t enough and want a block size increase. This has led to many arguments and failed ’roundtable’ agreements. Now since Barry Silbert’s “New York Agreement” miners who chose not to support Segwit in the past, promised to support the implementation in exchange for a 2MB hard fork.  The July 20 lock in period started going much faster once other miners joined the BIP91 signaling. This includes GBminers, Slush, and the anticipated signaling from the well-known F2poo,l which seemed undecided throughout most of the debate. Currently, a great majority of mining pools are supporting the lock-in period threshold, just a few percentages over 80 percent. After the next 336 blocks, and if all is successful with this plan, BIP91 will be enforced at block height 477120. Following this block there will still be a couple weeks of wait time until Segwit is officially active. The process of activating Segwit may not be super smooth, as there also could be problems with blockchain reorganization, a client issue where the bitcoin network doesn’t reorganize in unison.     For now, it seems the Segwit2x roadmap is going as planned. Following the activation of Segwit, developers and network participants will then prepare for the 2MB hard fork that should follow 12,960 blocks later (~3 months).              “Three plus months is the fallback safety measure, in case activation is slower than predicted,” explains Jeff Garzik the Segwit2x working group developer.

2017-07-20T17:00:46-04:00,Bitcoin.com’s Cloud Mining Services Sees Record Growth,Bitcoin.com,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-coms-cloud-mining-services-record-growth/,"Bitcoin.com’s mining services continue to grow exponentially as pool.bitcoin.com commands roughly 3 percent of the Bitcoin network’s global mining power. In addition to the company’s mining capabilities, Bitcoin.com is partnered with the largest U.S.-based bitcoin mining data center allowing the company to leverage mining services like no other business in the industry.         Bitcoin mining is a very competitive industry as miners worldwide are verifying transactions while securing the network for economic incentives. Bitcoin.com takes mining seriously with its world-class mining pool as well as offering the best cloud mining contracts in the industry. In the last quarter alone Bitcoin.com in partnership with a large confidential North America-based data center has purchased over US$15M worth of Bitcoin mining equipment and have sold more than $8M in cloud mining contracts.  Cloud mining is a unique service that allows anyone to earn bitcoins through the mining process without having to purchase specialized hardware or use complicated software. In essence, users purchase the mining power from a data center enabling them to obtain bitcoins. Bitcoin.com started its cloud mining operations back in May and has seen record sellouts ever since. “Our hashrate demand seems to be growing in lockstep with the Bitcoin price, and it doesn’t show signs of slowing,” explains Bitcoin.com developer Shaun Chong after the first wave of cloud mining contract sales were sold.  Bitcoin.com’s CEO Roger Ver is thrilled to see pool.bitcoin.com and the firm’s cloud mining services gain so much interest. “This clearly shows that Bitcoin.com is one of the most profitable companies in the entire ecosystem today. With our continued efforts we will pave the way for the future mass adoption of Bitcoin via on chain scaling as originally outlined by Satoshi Nakamoto.”

We can see the significant interest for bitcoin mining as specialized hardware and chips are getting harder to obtain because global manufacturers can’t keep up with the demand. As one of the main security components for bitcoin, the most trusted and tested blockchain worldwide, mining will continue to be a profitable industry. Bitcoin.com’s pool aims to sustain its leadership by offering the very best mining structure to its clients with 110 percent block reward and 0 percent fees. Further, our cloud mining offering includes three contract durations for maximum flexibility: three months, six months, and lifetime (while profitable) plans. Bitcoin.com sells cloud mining to continue growing its hashrate that supports on-chain scaling, and utilizes sales revenue to purchase more mining hardware. Bitcoin.com is a leader in the digital currency and blockchain industry by leveraging multiple facets of this emerging and innovative technology. The company’s mining pool and cloud services are growing in unison with bitcoin’s natural development as the future of money.

Also read: 13 Japanese Exchanges Agree to Suspend Bitcoin Service on August 1 This week, local publications reported that the first Bitcoin ATM (BTM) has arrived in the Balkan country of Kosovo. The newspaper Telegrafi described: The machine is operated by the Albvision Group, the publication reported, adding that it has been placed in the center of Pristina, the capital and largest city of Kosovo. Founded in 2000 in Kosovo with 54 employees currently, the group provides professional and strategic services, operating in sectors such as information and security systems, banking, energy, and telecommunications. According to Coinatmradar, the machine is located at “Qyteza Pejton, Str. Lorenc Antoni 31, Prishtina, Kosovo.” This two-way Bitcoin ATM is the BATM Two model which has “the best price/performance ratio on the ATM market,” claims its producer General Bytes. Only bitcoin will be available initially, but the company plans to add 10 other cryptocurrencies in the future, the publication detailed, adding that approximately 500 of these machines have been installed worldwide. The Bitcoin ATM news came shortly after the Central Bank of Kosovo issued a statement warning citizens about the use of digital currencies in the country. The bank wrote last month: Some commercial banks, such as TEB Bank and Raiffeisen Bank, have also declared that they do not deal with digital currencies, according to the news portal Fol Drejt! Ilirjana Tahiraj of Raiffeisen Bank told the publication that the bank does not accept bitcoin transfers. Meanwhile, interest in bitcoin has risen sharply in Kosovo. Despite the central bank’s warning and commercial banks’ refusal to deal with the digital currency, Fol Drejt! wrote “the increasing trend of bitcoin interest among citizens has not stopped.” In 2017, Kosovo imported equipment worth 800,000 euros which went towards the production or assembly of bitcoin mining devices, according to Kosovo Customs spokesperson Adriatik Stavileci. The news outlet then quoted her saying: Dite Gashi, the CTO and co-founder of Bitsapphire, a local Bitcoin and blockchain consulting company, explained the biggest concerns for bitcoin. He said it has become difficult to find graphic cards in the Kosovo market, and that there is also a degree of uncertainty regarding bitcoin investments since its value changes from moment to moment. “Regarding the legalization of digital currencies, he said that it is better for them to remain unregulated for some time,” the publication wrote.

Thirteen of the group’s bitcoin exchange members, including Coincheck, Gmo-Z, Bitbank, and Bitpoint, will suspend bitcoin deposits and withdrawals on August 1 at 00:00 Japan time. Also read: Japan’s Cryptocurrency Business Association Plans for August 1 Guidelines The Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association (JCBA), formerly known as the Virtual Currency Business Study Group, announced on Tuesday its official plan for August 1. Thirteen bitcoin exchange members of the association have agreed on how to deal with the possibility of a Bitcoin protocol split, which is expected on August 1 at 9:00 am Japan time, the JCBA detailed. “The occurrence of forking affects the transmission and receipt of bitcoins by all bitcoin users, and it is expected that all related virtual currency exchange operators and service providers will be seriously affected.” The exchanges have collectively declared: Currently, the following 13 bitcoin exchanges are members of the JCBA that have agreed to this plan. Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bitflyer, is not among the list of members of the association. According to a July 13 article by Nikkei, the exchange has not decided on a plan for the possible disruption, but is expected to come out with one this week. The suspensions will commence on August 1, 2017, at 00:00 Japan time. However, the JCBA warns that “in the event of the fork happening sooner than Aug 1, the suspension date/time may be advanced depending on the situation.” The official service restart date and time following the network disruption is still “undecided,” the association noted, adding that (loosely translated): What do you think about the JCBA’s plan to deal with the upcoming disruption?

2017-07-18T11:00:27-04:00,Following Money Through the Bitcoin Laundry Is Not So Easy,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/following-money-bitcoin-laundry/,"Just recently there was a small ransomware outburst called “Peyta” that attacked various computers around the world. The creators of Peyta didn’t make as much money as the Wannacry extortionists had made a few weeks earlier, as Petya only raked in around $8,000 worth of BTC. However, the money the hackers accumulated has moved and following those bitcoins has proven to be extremely difficult. Also read: Basel Institute: “Take Action Against Digital Currency Mixers/Tumblers” The latest Petya ransomware wasn’t as crazy as the mainstream media portrayed it to be, and the creators only made off with $8,000 in extortion funds. One of the reasons the attackers didn’t make much money was due to their email being shut down. What’s interesting about the Petya ransomware is the hackers chose to use one particular address to collect funds as opposed to multiple addresses commonly used in these types of protocols. After a couple of days, the hackers started moving the money to different addresses. Individuals following the funds believe the money was sent through a tumbler or a platform that mixes bitcoins in order to obfuscate the sending process. According to the publication Quartz those bitcoins will be extremely hard for law enforcement to locate. The news outlet says they followed the money as far as they could, but the bitcoins were sent through a series of transfers and one of them was a legitimate bitcoin exchange. After the first few hops, the publication details funds were sent to a “high volume address” which they assumed was the trading platform. After this point Quartz explains, they could only speculate on which transactions belonged to Petya. “We collected each spent output from that address, then each spent output from those addresses, and so on,” explains Quartz columnist Keith Collins. “In order to limit the number of rabbit holes the crawler followed, we only included transfers that occurred within eight hours of the first outgoing transaction from the first wallet. We considered high-volume wallets to be wallets that had three or more total transactions, as returned from the Blockchain.info API, but the vast majority of those had more than ten total transactions.” There are multiple ways for groups and individuals to mix their bitcoins to confuse blockchain surveillance. These include tumblers like Joinmarket and the many other mixing platforms found on the deep web. Further, some users opt to utilize altcoins like Zcash and Monero, because they believe these cryptocurrencies offer better anonymity. In the future, many people think better forms of cryptocurrency anonymization will be coming like Schnorr signatures and other types of Zero Knowledge platforms. However, law enforcement and government officials have been saying for quite some time that bitcoin mixers and anonymizers should be illegal. For instance, the Basel Institute on Governance, Europol, Interpol, and U.S. officials have been discussing proposals to “take action against digital currency mixers/tumblers.” Quartz details that the Petya funds were estimated to be sent to over 2373 addresses over the course of the mixing process. “If we knew what bitcoin address or addresses the Petya money ended up in, we’d likely find hundreds of thousands of transactions between that address and the starting address,” explains the news outlet. “That’s more than we could ever chart.” The news comes at a time when blockchain surveillance companies have become a hot topic, and just recently Chainalysis claimed to know the destination of the missing 650,000 Mt Gox bitcoins. With hackers mixing their coins through a series of transfers blockchain forensic companies may be fabricating how well they can follow these transactions. What do you think about mixing transactions? Do you think law enforcement can really follow all the outputs when funds are sent through a bitcoin tumbler? Let us know in the comments below.

Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release. Bitaccess announces the expansion of their purchasing methods to include EFT for all customers in Canada. EFT allows users to purchase both Bitcoin and Ethereum from the comfort of their own home, and is similar in function to a traditional bank transfer. In addition to the convenience of online payment processing, EFT also comes with lower fees than customers would encounter at a BTM, or when trading person-to-person. Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT) are known for their security, high speed-for-quantity, and cost efficiency. They are generally used to authorize the payment of bills, rather than the transfer of personal funds between accounts. EFT payments are sent between financial institutions in single, daily batched transactions by way of an automated clearing system, recognized for its utility around the world. The action of sending and receiving transfers via batched transactions allows fee’s to be significantly diminished from the high rates paid by individuals using EFTs close counterpart, the Wire Transfer. Customers wishing to engage this new style of payment must sign into or sign up for a bitaccess user account, and then create a ‘Buy Order’ that specifies EFT transfer as their chosen payment method. EFT hasn’t been available since 2016 when Coinbase abandoned the Canadian Market, Bitaccess has been focusing on serving Canada since 2014 with a locally based team and manufacturing. Visit bitaccess.co to pay for your next digital currency investment using EFT. Who is Bitaccess?

Public Personas Get Bullish on Bitcoin",Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/500000-per-bitcoin-public-personas-get-bullish-on-bitcoin/,"Financial strategists, stock analysts, and tech gurus are all bullish on bitcoin. Even amidst concerns about how bitcoin will be upgraded and its recent violent price fluctuations, several public figures believe the cryptocurrency has a bright future. They tend to see bitcoin trending upward as demand for the digital currency accelerates. In this regard, bitcoin will either “cannibalize gold” or cause John McAfee to “eat his own dick on national television.”  Also read: The Bitcoin Scaling Countdown: Miners Begin Running Segwit2x Software On July 7, Fundstrat’s Tom Lee became the first big league Wall Street strategist to analyze bitcoin under a light of optimism. In a report, he claimed bitcoin could reach $55,000 by 2022. He also commented on the gold market, saying that urgency for possessing bitcoin will act as a substitute for gold. A CNBC article covered his enthusiasm: “We believe one of the drivers [of bitcoin] is crypto-currencies are cannibalizing demand for gold. Based on this premise, we take a stab at establishing valuation framework for bitcoin. Based on our model, we estimate that bitcoin’s value per unit could be $20,000 to $55,000 by 2022.” He went on to say gold’s market value currently sits at $7.5 trillion, and bitcoin is $41 billion (at the time of writing). However, gold’s supply is swelling due to intensified mining operations, whereas bitcoin’s supply will remain stable as a result of the 21 million cap. This apparently places a huge demand burden on bitcoin, which may cause the price to trend forcefully upward. Major stock research analyst Ronnie Moas also commented on Bitcoin’s supply cap. Earlier this month, he said, “Since only 21 million bitcoin can ever exist, increasing demand for the digital currency will naturally drive its price up.” Moas believes bitcoin can reach $5,000 just before the end of the year. He elaborated in comment to CNBC: “$5,000 could happen in a few months. It’s only starting to gain traction right now. It’s starting to spread like wildfire right now.” The analyst said he personally put a few hundred dollars into bitcoin and several other cryptocurrencies. He plans on investing even more. He mentioned bitcoin is not something he wants to miss out on. “What is more painful than losing money to cryptocurrency is inaction in the ecosystem, Moas said. Cybersecurity guru and libertarian presidential candidate John McAfee’s thinking follows alongside Moas, except McAfee tweeted to one of his followers today that if his predictions fail to materialize, he will dine on his own penis in front of everyone. McAfee made the comment after saying bitcoin will move above $500,000 within three years. He said, “Bitcoin’s low of $1,800+ yesterday simply could not be maintained. In the long term Bitcoin moves above $500,000 within three years. Bets?” Shortly after making the comment, one of his followers responded, “So 1btc 500k $ within 3years?” McAfee’s response was memorable:  Needless to say, these public figures and many others are predicting an extremely bullish ride over the next few years for bitcoin. It will be interesting to see how everything pans out, especially when promises of eating one’s own phallus are made publicly in defense of bitcoin’s predicted gains. Will bitcoin remain bullish well into the future? Will McAfee follow through with his promises if his prediction fails? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-07-17T15:28:44-04:00,The Bitcoin Scaling Countdown: Miners Begin Running Segwit2x Software,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-scaling-countdown-miners-segwit2x-software/,"It seems July 17 has initiated the beginning steps towards Segwit2x activation as the code has been released and miners who supported the “New York Agreement” (NYA) have started running the new BTC1 software. Also read: A Brief Glimpse Into the Lives of Chinese Bitcoin Miners As the price of bitcoin dropped to new lows this weekend, some bitcoin proponents were patiently waiting for the promised BTC1 software. Now it seems in a short period of time the bitcoin ‘community’ may see the protocol Segregated Witness (Segwit) activated as the mining community has begun to signal BIP91. The proposal BIP91 is a combination of Segwit2x and BIP148. The version 1.14.4 code has been pushed to the repository by the Segwit2x working group, and a few mining pools have already started running the protocol. The China-based Bitmain technologies announced their support via Twitter by stating; Other mining pools signaling and mining BIP91 blocks include Bixin, Antpool, BTC.com, Bitfury, and Bitclub so far. Now spectators are waiting for other pools like BTCC, F2pool, Slush, and a few others to join. Back in June Bitcoin.com reported on how a vast majority of the hashrate was signaling their initial support for Segwit2x. Miners running the new BTC1 software and currently signaling BIP91 means that if enough hashrate reaches over 80 percent and continues for a 336 block period, Segwit will “lock in”. If all is successful, this will then lead to another 336 block period that will activate the Segwit protocol on the main chain. It’s still a bit early and hard to gauge the overall sentiment of bitcoiners, but there are definitely a lot of individuals on forums and social media who support the Segwit2x plan. For instance, Fred Wilson, managing partner at Union Square Ventures revealed he favored Segwit2x adoption on July 17 via the investor’s blog. “I am for the Segwit2x proposal and hope that we see it broadly adopted later this month,” explains Wilson. “There is a chance that doesn’t happen, and a user activated soft fork (UASF) could be used to force Segwit into the market. I personally hope that a user activated soft fork doesn’t happen as it would create a lot of turbulence.” Rootstock Chief Scientist, Sergio Demian Lerner also states his opinion of the Segwit2x compromise revealing he doesn’t believe the intention is to “fire core programmers,” which is one of the conspiracies that has been spread around the community. “In my humble opinion the New York Agreement wanted to start from Bitcoin Core 0.14 because the group wants core to keep leading Bitcoin,” explains the Rootstock developer and initial creator of the Segwit2x proposal. Further Sergio Demian Lerner details that he knows Segwit isn’t perfect but he doesn’t think perfection is obtainable anyway. “I audited Segwit in 2016. Found problems. Code far from perfect. HOWEVER I DO support Segwit because I don’t believe in perfection,” says the Rootstock engineer. “You have to know the actual code in detail to say you know Segwit. That’s the problem with Segwit. That’s a community fault.” There are still those who vehemently disagree with the progression of BTC1 and are showing sole support for either UASF or UAHF, vowing never to compromise. However, gauging sentiment via Twitter or Reddit forums is a horrible metric, and the only things that matters now in this debate are the actions from the network’s participants, rather than mere internet chatter. People are also discussing the next step of the Segwit2x plan after the Segregated Witness protocol is implemented, which is the 2MB hard fork. The hard fork subject is also a contentious topic, and people are wondering if NYA participants will still support the hard fork after Segwit gets implemented. If Segwit2x continues to be agreed upon then exactly 12,960 blocks (~3 months) after Segwit activates — The hard fork will commence. Now if mining pools continue to do what they agreed upon in regards to the NYA plan and other miners join in then the implementation of Segwit will likely happen soon.

In a recent interview with Deepdotweb, Phishkingz details the methods that he uses when stealing bitcoins. Also Read: Law Enforcement Takes Down the Biggest Darknet Market on the Deep Web  Darknet phisher, Phishkingz, recently discussed methods that he claims allowed him to generate over $1 million in 12 months by stealing bitcoins. Phishkingz claims to have traded approximately 500 bitcoin on Localbitcoins in the last 14 months, the entirety of which was generated through phishing. Phishkingz states that he is also a dark market vendor. His decision to start phishing to steal bitcoins was made following the discovery of an error on Alphabay’s forums “that allowed [Phishkingz] to see new members the second they joined.” The hacker would then directly contact new members, “send[ing[ them to my link with a verification process.” From them, Phishkingz is “able to obtain the login details syncing, and the mnemonic phrases, as well as any PGP private key and password and pin code.” The hacker would then “save a bookmark using blockchain.info… [and] highlight 50 [addresses] at a time every 20 minutes checking for deposits”. The majority of the withdrawals would be processed manually, despite early experimentation with bots. Phishkingz claims that his operations expanded to a scale that required the assistance of employees, stating that at one point he “had 27 people working… running phishers” that were stealing bitcoins for him.  Phishkingz describes Alphabay’s moderators as providing little support to his victims. “The admins didn’t really care about their customers, and it only took opening a support ticket with a problem to learn this. BM (Big Muscles – an Alphabay moderator) especially is a stupid one. He would let me into accounts for 50% if I provided mnemonic phrase knowing I had phished the account in the first place.” Following the recent removal of Alphabay, the bitcoin hacker claims to “have moved to Dream Market and already made 4 BTC since yesterday launching the new site.” The number of phishers attempting to hack bitcoins outside of the deep web has also recently proliferated. The record breaking Tezos ICO has attracted the attention of phishers, seeing clone sites being hosted for the purposes of stealing bitcoins. Other creative hackers have recently started setting up websites for fake ICOs, infecting victims’ computers through downloading malicious software disguised as project whitepapers. With bitcoin and altcoins seeing unprecedented media exposure, a growing presence of bitcoin hackers and scammers operating in all corners of the internet appears to be an unfortunate and inevitable consequence of greater cryptocurrency adoption.

These tokens are the result of plans to hard fork Bitcoin and run the Bitcoin ABC client. Also read: Segwit2x Beta Released and New UAHF Code Proposal `ABC´ Removes 1MB-Limit Cryptocurrency mining pool and exchange platform Viabtc published their statement concerning the possible upcoming Bitcoin User Activated Hard Fork (UAHF) on Sunday, stating: Viabtc is the world’s 8th largest mining pool with ~5% of total hashrate currently. The Shenzhen-based company also offers cloud mining and has its own cryptocurrency exchange which trades bitcoin, ether, litecoin, and zcash. The exchange was launched after the company closed a 20 million CNY Series A funding round in March led by Bitmain, operator of the world’s largest bitcoin mining pool Antpool. Sunday’s statement was in response to inquiries from miners and users about the company’s support for the proposed hard fork client called Bitcoin ABC (Adjustable Blocksize Cap), Viabtc detailed. This new version of Bitcoin was unveiled at The Future of Bitcoin Conference 2017 by developer Amaury Séchet. It has an 8mb block size default, but does not include the upgrade for Segregated Witness (Segwit), according to its code on Github. Instead, it makes a change in the way block sizes are adjusted through a voting process among miners. The ABC specification falls in line with mining hardware manufacturer Bitmain’s hard fork protection plan against a User Activated Soft Fork (UASF), but Bitmain has not officially endorsed the ABC project. CEO Jihan Wu has agreed to support the Segwit2x plan with his hashing power, as stated on his blog. “We support the agreement and we want to make it happen as soon as possible.” The company then tweeted on Monday, “all our #bitcoin mining pools will start running the new #Segwit2x software today.” However, the BIP 148 soft fork will commence on August 1, followed by the UAHF plan which will activate at 12:20 UTC time on August 1, according to Viabtc’s announcement. Viabtc is also launching a BCC mining pool, the company also announced in Sunday’s statement: Miners who want to mine on the new BCC blockchain can begin mining in the new pool on July 22. However, until UAHF activates on August 1, they can only mine bitcoins since the fork has not taken place yet. Then on the 1st, the new pool will automatically switch from mining bitcoin to BCC, the statement explains. The company’s cloud mining division is also offering BCC-mining contracts starting on July 22. At that time, current S9 cloud mining contract holders can trade their contracts at a 1:1 ratio for the new S9-BCC contracts. Also starting on July 22, Viabtc’s customers can trade their bitcoins for two new assets on Viabtc’s exchange; the new BCC token and a temporary asset called Btc_Frozen2, which “represents frozen BTC assets and is not available for trading.” Neither of the new tokens will be available for withdrawal, according to the announcement. To represent the coin split on the exchange, Viabtc wrote, “you can trade 1 BTC into 1 BCC token and 1 Btc_Frozen2 token, or vice versa.” After UAHF activates at 12:20 UTC time on August 1, all of the Btc_Frozen2 assets will be redeemed as bitcoins and the exchange “will decide on the best timing to allow deposit and withdrawal for BCC.” What do you think of Viabtc’s plan?

2017-07-17T01:00:32-04:00,A Brief Glimpse Into the Lives of Chinese Bitcoin Miners,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/brief-glimpse-lives-chinese-bitcoin-miners/,"Ever wonder what it’s like to work at a bitcoin mining farm in China? Just recently two reports revealed the inner workings of Chinese bitcoin mines operating in the country’s Sichuan prοvince. Also read: Japan’s Cryptocurrency Business Association Plans for August 1 Guidelines Last week on July 11, China’s Central Television (CCTV-2) channel aired a special documentary on bitcoin mining operations located in Kangding county in the southwest region of the country. The channels news reporter drives to a desolate mountainous area in Sichuan to visit a three-story mining data center. Each floor is filled with mining rigs housed on metal racks and surrounded by massive fans. CCTV also interviews Wang, the young data center owner in his twenties who runs five mining sites in the area. According to a translation from the local publication, 8btc, Wang says he runs a medium sized data center that can grow bigger. The twenty-year-old native says the operation mines 16 BTC (US$30,000) a day.    “We are a middle-sized mining factory with 5000 bitcoin miners,” explains Wang. “We still have room to run another 5000 mining machines.” Wang and the data center’s operations manager Xu says lots of people are choosing to set up mining sites in Xinjiang, Sichuan, Yunnan, and Inner Mongolia. The reason for this is cheaper electricity from hydropower stations located in the mountains. Wang details that typically electricity in China is 0.7 yuan per KwH, but by partnering with neighboring hydropower stations mining facilities are paying 0.3 yuan per KwH (about 0.045 USD at the time of writing). “[Electricity] is directly transmitted from nearby hydropower stations,” Wang tells the CCTV journalist. “This is mainly why we set up the site here. Bitcoin mining is electricity-consuming and 50 percent of our profits go to the electricity bill.” According to CCTV’s broadcast, an executive at the Sichuan Electric Power Company says that these mining sites are not supposed to partner with hydropower stations. The sites have been investigated he says, but nothing materialized from the local government inspection. Furthermore, Wang says he doesn’t pay taxes for his bitcoin revenue. “Why should I?…We are mining bitcoin, it’s all about computational power. It’s like playing games. Why should we pay taxes for playing games?” Another report from the Chinese photographer Liu Xingzhe covers the interesting world of Chinese bitcoin mines. Liu’s photographs show workers at data centers in another area located in the Sichuan prοvince living in dormitories and taking care of machines for weeks on end. Many of the workers travel from other towns and hitchhike to the remote mountainous region to make a better salary than most local jobs. Miners at Lui’s farm work during all hours of the day and evening reassembling calculatiοn bοards and fixing malfunctioning machines in the middle of the night. Lui tells the publication he has moved his mining operation from Henan to Sichuan to leverage the cheaper electricity in the region. Additionally, Lui details that he manages roughly 7,000 mining rigs for clients located in China. One of the bitcoin mine workers explains that the nearest town is roughly 20 miles away and there is nowhere to spend money near the facilities. “Τhe gοοd thing is, there isn’t anywhere tο spend mοney, sο yοu can save yοur whοle salary,” οne miner tοld the photographer Liu Χingzhe.

2017-07-16T19:00:24-04:00,Mining Bitcoin Using Old Computers and Retro Gaming Consoles,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/mining-bitcoin-old-computers-retro-gaming-consoles/,"Bitcoin mining has grown into a vast economy over the past few years as large ASIC-powered mining farms process transactions for the $32 billion dollar market. In the early days, people could mine bitcoins using their central processing units (CPU) and they still can, but the undertaking is extremely inefficient. However, a few people still mess around mining bitcoins using older computers and retro devices merely for the fun of it and for experimentation purposes. Also Read: Investment Funds That Offer Cryptocurrency Exposure See Big Gains The bitcoin mining ecosystem is a competitive environment of pools processing transactions while simultaneously securing the network. Miners run special software and use application-specific integrated circuitry (ASIC) to mine bitcoins these days, using chips far more efficient than your standard CPU. Currently, older computers can mine bitcoins at a prolonged rate, but it’s still pretty cool to see if a classic system can perform the task of bitcoin mining. One bitcoin enthusiast has done just that a few times with older computers. Ken Shirriff is well-known in the bitcoin community for his work on getting the bitcoin symbol added to Unicode. Shirriff also has a popular blog where writes about his projects and how he has mined bitcoins using classic devices from the past. Just recently Shirriff has been working on a Xerox Alto restoration and managed to get the seventies built computer to mine bitcoins at 1.5 hashes/second. The Xerox Alto is a well-known computer classic that was the first device to support a graphical user interface (GUI) in 1973. “I’ve been restoring a Xerox Alto minicomputer from the 1970s and figured it would be interesting to see if it could mine bitcoins,” explains Shirriff. The computer’s 1.5 blocks per second is significantly slower than the chips used today. Shirriff details the Xerox Alto’s speed would take “5000 times the age of the universe” to mine one block. For demonstration purposes, Shirriff used the input of a successfully mined block to see if the algorithm succeeded. Shirriff’s code is available on Github for those who would like to try out Xerox Alto mining.       Another project Shirriff worked on back in 2015 was mining with a 55-year-old IBM 1401 mainframe at 80 seconds per hash. This computer was the best-selling computer of the mid-1960s and mainly used for business purposes.  “While modern hardware can compute billions of hashes per second, the 1401 takes 80 seconds to compute a single hash,” details Shirriff. “This illustrates the improvement of computer performance in the past decades, most famously described by Moore’s Law — To summarize, to mine a block at current difficulty, the IBM 1401 would take about 5×10^14 years (about 40,000 times the current age of the universe).” Lastly, another neat project is another incredibly slow miner built in 2013 out of a 1985 Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). The creator of the NES mining system was joking around with his friend about mining bitcoins with an 8-bit game console. Well, he took that as a challenge and built a Nintendo that communicated with the network and performed SHA256 hashing. For other portions of the project, he did need a Raspberry Pi for computing that did not take place on the NES. “SHA256 hashing uses many 32-bit operations, and the 6502 in the NES is an 8-bit CPU,” explains the retro miner creator. “Initially I thought this would be a significant challenge, but with some modifications, I got an open implementation of SHA256 to compile to a 6502 target using the cc65 compiler.” In the end, the NES miner worked and started searching for blocks with Slush’s pool, but the creator said there was plenty of room for build improvements. “What I’m doing now is very slow, and I admit, pretty lame,” explains the retro miner’s blog post. Additionally, bitcoiners have had great discussions concerning mining bitcoin with other gaming consoles like the Playstation 3.  Obviously, these types of projects won’t be mass adopted to mine excessive amounts of bitcoins like ASICs because it would take many lifetimes to find one block using a retro device. However even though watching an older computer or gaming console mine bitcoins is super slow it’s very interesting to see that these devices are compatible with the Bitcoin network.

He did not know what to expect when launching the hotline, according to bitcoin.com’s previous interview, but knew there had been a lot of negativity and vitriol permeating the ecosystem. He just wanted to find a way to inject some optimism. That was the ultimate purpose of the hotline, even if it was not touted as 100% serious. It was not a joke either, though. Also read: Central Bank of Albania Lists Five Most Important Bitcoin Risks in Public Warning  Lasher outlined many highlights about the hotline’s performance. He said quite a few old friends called to catch up or chat. He had many callers who harbored concerns about the blocksize debate and what would happen to their bitcoin. Some of them even appeared to need moral support as a result of bitcoin’s current bear market trend. Some just called to request new features for breadwallet’s native application. They were interested in new services and promoted many possible ideas. Lasher said he accepted these calls with humility, saying it may directly alter Breadwallet’s road map. He said the hotline also received calls after hours, especially on the weekends. This acted as a testament to the popularity of the hotline. Many of the callers also left a voicemail. Lasher mentioned 20% of the callers were women. This was good news for him, because it suggested the bitcoin community has diversified. The most shocking revelation of the Hotline for Lasher was the fact he received zero prank calls. Not a single person called just to get a quick laugh and waste time. That appears like it bodes well for the entire community. Lasher elaborated and provided a graph of the calls: “Of all the calls we received, we did not get a single prank call. Frankly this was the most shocking revelation of all, considering it was our biggest fear that people with too much time on their hands would abuse the line for a cheap laugh. But we had zero, nada, zilch. Faith in humanity restored. For those who are interested, below is a distribution of the types of calls we received:” The number to the hotline is still posted on Breadwallet’s blog.

2017-07-16T04:04:34-04:00,Possible Bitcoin Network Spam Attack is One User’s Moby Dick,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-spam-attack-one-users-white-whale/,"A Twitter user named LaurentMT has been battling his very own “Moby Dick.” He implied the White Whale has come in the form of a spam attack on the network, which has caused blocks to consume too many utxos (unspent transaction outputs) in the system in recent weeks. The user commented on Twitter in a series of charts, primarily containing information on block size and utxos.  Also read: Morgan Stanley Believes Bitcoin Acceptance is Shrinking Most interestingly, LaurentMT suggested recent mempool backlog — causing slow transaction times and higher fees — has been a result of this Moby Dick spam attack. For anyone curious about utxo’s, they are merely unspent bitcoins that can potentially eat up block space and clog the network.   LaurentMT Tweeted the attack on the network has been in effect for 18 months, until Janurary 2017. He went on to say spamming the network with fan-out transactions is a multi-stage operation, and people generally only notice the first stage and then forget an attack was under way. Laurent mentioned these type of attacks are insidious and can last months or years without anyone knowing. Lauren’tMT isn’t the only individual to suggest the network has been attacked. Ian Freeman of Freetalk Live wrote an article celebrating reduced fees on the bitcoin network. However, he mentioned the network could have been backlogged as a result of a possible network spam attack. He said this kind of thinking obviously leads into conspiracy theory territory, but the halted attack does coincide with agreements for activating Segwit, especially the “New York Agreement” or Segwit2x. Ian said, “Some have suggested that the Bitcoin network was being spammed with junk transactions and that whoever was spamming it, ceased after the agreement was put in place. That’s obviously speculation, but if it’s true, then who was doing the spamming? Was it the people supporting small blocks? The people supporting large blocks? Both of them?” No one really knows for sure if the network was being spammed. But LaurentMT’s accumulated evidence gives people pause to consider the network may have been dealing with the White Whale for some time. LaurentMT called for more research to discover the truth. Do you believe the network has had to deal with a White Whale (spam) attack on the network? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-07-15T19:00:14-04:00,MIT Study Shows Exclusivity Encourages Greater Bitcoin Adoption,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/mit-bitcoin-study-shows-exclusivity-encourages-greater-adoption/,"MIT launched a study in 2014 that showed early adopters help to spread new technology throughout society, if they feel they have exclusive access to it. The study’s official research paper was released on Friday, which was published in Science. The experimenters used bitcoin as the “new technology” in the study.
 Also read: Paul Sztorc Suggests Revising Bitcoin’s Scaling Roadmap Researchers offered participants $100 dollars worth of bitcoin (Bitcoin’s price was around $400 at the time). The students would set up a digital wallet and then wait for researchers to allot funds to their wallets. The researchers, Christian Catalini and Catherine Tucker, saw this experiment as a one-time opportunity to study the role of early adopters in spreading technology in a controlled environment. The experiment’s catch was that half of the early adopters would randomly receive their bitcoin payments delayed. The MIT article elaborated, “During the rollout, the researchers randomly delayed giving half the students their bitcoin allotment by a couple of weeks. Students who were identified as early adopters of Bitcoin, but whose payment was delayed, cashed out their balance and abandoned the technology at nearly twice the rate of early adopters who received their payment earlier. The early adopters who cashed out also influenced those around them to do the same in high numbers.” In other words, if the early adopters felt like they were not exclusive or did not gain any consumption value from the new tech, they were likely to cash out. If they were in a public setting, like the MIT dorm rooms, they would likewise influence others to cash out. This diminished the number of early adopters. The study was the first to determine what happens when “new early adopters” are denied first and exclusive access to new technology. The researchers identified who classified as an “new early adopter” by how fast they signed up to the study. They compared these “new early adopters” (NEA’s) to “natural late adopters” (NLA’s). The first 25% who signed up to the study were classified as an NEA. The study explained the qualities of NEA’s: Even though these NEA’s were highly computer literate and understood the technology underlying bitcoin, social and psychological reasons caused them to cash out and stop using the technology. It seems randomly delaying payments caused internal frustration and made early adopters feel less than exclusive. One would expect people with high technological literacy to stay involved no matter what. Randomly delaying the bitcoin payments resulted in “two parallel universes,” researchers said. They did this to determine the S-curve, or the measure of the speed of adoption of innovation in societies. Catalini explained, “In one universe, we ended up seeding Bitcoin in the optimal way, by giving it first to early adopters and later to everybody else. In the other parallel universe, the opposite was likely to happen.” The researchers found the two-week cash-out rate on those NEA’s who received their bitcoins late rose 18%, which was well over non-delayed NEA cash-out of 11%. The researchers said these alleged early adopters cashing out just because their payment was delayed was surprising. The results off the study offer a couple of key insights for new tech startups, said the researchers. The most important is for technology firms to take advantage of people’s desire for exclusivity while using new technology. NEA’s are likely to influence others to adopt it if they feel unique. This is the key to diffusing new tech throughout society. The researcher explained: The student participants who held onto their $100 worth of bitcoin would presently be holding $700, noted the MIT article.

It includes five of what the bank considers the “most important” risks associated with digital currencies for Albania. Also read: India’s Supreme Court Seeks Answers as Bitcoin Legalization Focus Turns to Taxation The Bank of Albania, which is the Balkan country’s central bank, issued a public notice warning Albanians of the risks related to the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin. The bank wrote: Citing how the absence of rules can result in significant risks, uncertainties, and a lack of protection against losses, the bank stated that anyone engaged in this kind of activity does so at their own risk. This is the first time the Bank of Albania has issued a warning about bitcoin, which still has a very small market in the country with only a handful of Localbitcoin traders. This statement follows an earlier warning by the Albanian Financial Supervisory Authority about the risks of using any unlicensed online trading platforms, Tirana Times detailed. Bitcoin was not mentioned in that previous warning. To raise public awareness of the risks of digital currencies, the Albanian central bank has listed five of what it considers the “most important” risks for Albania in its announcement: First, the bank noted that the values of digital currencies are “quite unstable,” citing that they “can be manipulated” which could lead to significant losses for investors. In addition, the lack of liquidity could impede the conversion between them and fiat. Second, digital currency exchanges are unregulated and unregistered, which could also lead to losses. Third, some of these exchange platforms are “quite vulnerable to cyber attacks,” the bank explained. Investments could be at risk since these attacks can happen at any time and, in many cases, there may be no recovery option. Fourth, “while investments in these currencies are anonymous, they can be used by individuals to enable illegal activities such as money laundering, financing of terrorism or smuggling of illicit goods,” the bank detailed. Fifth, the bank described that “at the request of the virtual currency scheme, people need to digitize their identification, such as by scanning their passport, retina or fingerprint.” The identification tools they use “are not subject to the laws and regulations for the protection of personal data or safety standards. Consequently, there is no guarantee that these credentials will be administered safely to avoid their theft or misuse.” The bank then concluded (loosely translated): What do you think of the Albanian central bank’s warning?

2017-07-15T10:35:55-04:00,Markets Update: Bears Drag the Bitcoin Price Down to New Lows,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bears-drag-bitcoin-price-lows/,"This week the price of bitcoin has been descending downwards following a bearish trendline and is currently hovering just around the US$2000 range. The price started its downtrend on July 10 after staying around the $2550 territory for a few days, but subsequently started dropping to a low of $2225 on July 14. At press time the price of BTC is struggling to stay above $2K, and current technical indicators are showing the bear run may not be over. Also read: August 1 and the Potential Disruption of the Bitcoin Network It’s been a pretty grueling week if you’ve been watching cryptocurrency markets, as bitcoin and various altcoins have drastically corrected in value. On July 14 bitcoin’s price formed some new lows dipping to the $2225 range forming a downwards triangular pattern. Over the course of the day and into the overnight the price per BTC continued to slide until finally subsiding to just above the $2K mark. The decentralized currency’s total market capitalization is now only $33 billion, but due to the significant drop in altcoin markets, BTC dominance is up to 46 percent. Bitcoin trade volume is seeing mediocre activity compared to weeks prior at roughly $1 billion USD worth of trading per day. Technical indicators show that traders have allowed bears to reign over the market and the ball is in their court now. At press time the long term 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is well above the 100 SMA, pointing to continued market losses. The Relative Strength Index (RSI) has dropped pretty low since July 12 indicating the beginning of the seller’s market takeover. Further stochastic indicators are also signaling bearish conditions and those shorting the market may be able to set some downside targets. However, at the time of writing, there is a significant foundation at the $1950-2K range and the price may hover in this vicinity for a few more hours. The bearish market sentiment is likely due to the protocol changes planned for the end of the month. There have been many discussions on the various scenarios where the bitcoin blockchain could split on August 1. Many bitcoiners are patiently waiting to see if the storm passes, but no one knows exactly how things will play out between UASF, UAHF, and Segwit2x. Some bitcoin proponents are fairly positive that Segwit will be implemented soon and the August 1 scenarios may not happen. Other bitcoin enthusiasts are waiting for the next Segwit2x release that is expected to come out this weekend, according to Jeff Garzik. When this happens, the vast majority of miners signaling support for Segwit2x will actually start running the code. The uncertainty tied to the bitcoin ecosystem is likely affecting altcoins markets as well. Just like Crypto Compare’s Charles Hayter told us last week, “a rising tide lifts all boats, but the opposite is also true.” Overall bitcoiners are either not happy about the price drop or enthusiastically detailing they are buying the dip. It’s safe to assume as the next two weeks get closer, there will be some volatile action for intra-range players to profit off scalps and breaks. Some traders are speculating that Segwit will be activated soon and the price will reverse back up the ladder. Other traders are envisioning a continued drop to the $1800 territory and a possible following rise after that low price point. One thing is for sure is that traders are uncertain right now and the bulls have stepped off to the sidelines for a lower price entry. Bear Scenario: If bitcoin breaks the key resistance range below $2K we will see lower trajectories towards the $1800-1900s. At press time according to order books and depth readings, there is a solid foundation within the $1800-2000 territory that should certainly last for the next few days. These critical zones, however, can cause quite a bit of fear and uncertainty which can always spark the possibility of more intensified panic selling. Bull Scenario: If buy pressure picks up after consolidating above the $2K range we could see some nice recovery over the next 24-hours. Sell walls are pretty flat at the moment, and the price could break higher with ease if bullish traders decide to jump back in the game. However, it seems most buyers are waiting for a lower price trajectory and are assuming this will happen with the current looming possibility of a chain split. Another bullish theory that could take place is; Segwit gets activated within the next two weeks, and the price climbs upwards following this event.

Bitcoin.com recently reported on the government setting up a task force to evaluate whether to regulate and legalize bitcoin, which is expected to take 6 months. Also read: Indian Bitcoin Adoption Responds to Government Signalling for Regulation The Supreme Court of India has asked the central government and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) for information on steps taken to ensure digital currencies are not used for terror financing or money laundering, reported News18 on Friday. The publication detailed: In addition, “a PIL claimed that the RBI was failing to regulate transactions in virtual currency,” the news outlet detailed. “It also alleged that virtual currency was being used for terror funding and money laundering.” While bitcoin is already being widely used in India, News18 wrote that there is still “no clear law stating whether bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are legal in India.” The RBI has declared bitcoin illegal. On Wednesday, RBI Governor Urjit Patel, speaking at a meeting of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, reiterated this view. “The case of bitcoin was raised loudly and many Parliament members raised the question whether this currency is illegal in India,” India Today reported. The governor responded by saying “the Reserve Bank has already said that the cryptocurrency is illegal in India.” While the RBI considers bitcoin illegal, the Finance Ministry is still evaluating whether to legalize and regulate the digital currency. Last month, Bitcoin.com reported on the Indian government setting up a task force to provide recommendations regarding bitcoin regulations in India. Until the Finance Ministry has finalized its decision, bitcoin is “neither illegal nor legal in India,” wrote the second most circulated English-language newspaper in India, The Hindu, on Thursday. A few Indian government officials have recently told The Hindu what they have been considering regarding how to regulate bitcoin. The publication wrote: In contrast, Japan and Australia have recently abolished their goods and services taxes on bitcoin purchases. Japan modified their tax law in April but it went into effect on July 1 whereas Australia had been working on removing bitcoin double taxation for over a year. In the meeting chaired by Finance Minister Arun Jaitley last month, a few options were discussed such as limited regulation. “This means reiterating that cryptocurrencies are not recognised and those who deal in them do so at their own risk, while focusing on curbing illegal activities,” the news outlet described. “A proposal to ban such currency altogether was also considered at the meeting,” according to the newspaper. However, only a few top officials were in favor of this option from the Ministries of Finance, Home Affairs and IT, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), the RBI, the State Bank of India, and NITI Aayog. A government official told the news outlet that “the discussion on whether cryptocurrencies should be banned or regulated has been on for some time,” adding that the pros and cons of this option were discussed at the meeting. A different government official familiar with the matter said: Instead of banning, the government discussed how regulating bitcoin would boost blockchain technology and “encourage the development of a supervision ecosystem,” which they believe tracks both legal and possibly illegal activities. In addition, it will “promote a formal tax base,” the official said. If the government decides to regulate cryptocurrencies, then they would be treated as “digital asset, similar to gold,” The Hindu explained, noting that they will be traded on registered exchanges. This “would ‘promote’ a formal tax base, while keeping a tab on their use for illegal activities such as money laundering, terror funding and drug trafficking,” the newspaper detailed. “The new regime may possibly bring their trading under the oversight of the stock market regulator, Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).” What do you think the Indian government will do about bitcoin?

2017-07-14T13:00:28-04:00,Morgan Stanley Believes Bitcoin Acceptance is Shrinking,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/morgan-stanley-believes-bitcoin-acceptance-is-shrinking-others-object/,"Investment bank Morgan Stanley recently came out with a report suggesting bitcoin acceptance has dropped to “virtually zero and shrinking.” The report was created by the investment bank’s internal analyst team, which was headed by James E Faucette.  Also read: BTCC Founder Bobby Lee Says Cryptocurrencies Need Regulation A Yahoo Financial article elaborated, saying, “According to the bank, last year bitcoin was accepted at five of of the top 500 online merchants. Today, only three of the top 500 merchants accept bitcoin as a form of payment. ” The bank suggested that this fact is striking, because bitcoin has seen such monstrous growth over the last couple of months. Morgan Stanley provided three reasons why it believes merchant acceptance is shrinking. They said the first reason is bitcoin’s bull market nature. The price tends to skyrocket and people want to hold it for the purposes of gaining incredible amounts of wealth. People would rather do this than use it as a currency, said the bank. This provides evidence bitcoin is more of an investment vehicle than a form of currency. Bitcoin’s scalability problem represents another issue. The analyst team pointed out merchants may not want to accept the cryptocurrency because of fears regarding the scaling debate. All the uncertainty and fear surrounding it has allegedly led to hesitation about bitcoin adoption. Lastly, the investment bank pointed out the main players in the bitcoin space are not cajoling merchants into adopting the currency. The bank clarified: It is currently unclear if the Morgan Stanley research included bitcoin merchant adoption worldwide—as well as non-major retailer acceptance—because a July 13 article on pymnts.com titled “Bitcoin Tracker: Mainstream Acceptance On The Rise” declared the exact opposite. The article proclaimed, “The digital currency has been restricted to the financial sector, but it’s slowly moving its way into more mainstream uses. One of the main issues that most have had with the digital currency is that because of a lack of a central authority, it can be tough to regulate.” Pymnts mentioned that many non-financial entities have begun making changes so they can adopt bitcoin. For instance, the article said, Burger King locations in Russia are slated to start accepting the cryptocurrency over the next few weeks.

2017-07-14T11:30:07-04:00,Paul Sztorc Suggests Revising Bitcoin’s Scaling Roadmap,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/paul-sztorc-revising-bitcoins-scaling-roadmap/,"On July 10 Hivemind’s chief scientist, and Bloq developer, Paul Sztorc, announced updating Bitcoin’s scaling roadmap created in December 2015 to a newer version. Sztorc believes the current roadmap needs revision and is “simply too old to serve this function any longer.” Also read: Hivemind, Bloq Developer Paul Sztorc Discusses Bitcoin & Sidechains Bitcoin software developer Paul Sztorc wants to update the Bitcoin Scaling Roadmap created by Greg Maxwell on Dec 7, 2015. Sztorc says Maxwell’s scaling roadmap succeeded in a “few crucial ways,” but the developer thinks there needs to be a revision. One that removes what has been achieved so far, updates it with future plans and outlines a timeline for protocols like the Lightning Network and Schnorr signatures.   “Unfortunately, the Dec 2015 roadmap is now 19 months old — it is quite obsolete and replacing it is long overdue,” explains Sztorc via the Bitcoin developer mailing list. “For example, it highlights older items (CSV, Compact Blocks, Versionbits) as being future improvements, and makes no mention of new high-likelihood improvements (Schnorr) or misemphasizes them (LN). It even contains mistakes (Segwit fraud proofs).” Following Sztorc’s reasoning for wanting to revise the roadmap, he provides his own first draft and says he is open to edits and feedback. Some of the things that have been completed and should be removed in Sztorc’s opinion include Versionbits (BIP 9), Compact Blocks (BIP 152), and Check Sequence Verify (BIP 112). Then Sztorc goes onto discussing the Segwit protocol as the first part of the revised roadmap. Below the Segwit section, the developer then describes a rough timeline for Schnorr signatures, the Lightning Network, and transaction compression.  After these focal points, Sztorc has outlined his proposal called Drivechain “which allows bitcoins to be temporarily offloaded to ‘alternative’ blockchain networks.” Sztorc told Bitcoin.com this past February he’s dedicated most of his time to the Drivechain project. Sztorc describes Drivechain’s potential in his mailing list announcement saying; Sztorc concludes his letter by saying his outlined proposals “may not be sufficient.” The Drivechain developer then adds that it may be necessary to hard fork the network and increase the block size limit. “Such an increase should take advantage of the existing research on hard forks, which is substantial,” Sztorc adds. “Specifically, there is some consensus that Spoonnet is the most attractive option for such a hardfork. There is currently no consensus on a hard fork date, but there is a rough consensus that one would require at least six months to coordinate effectively, which would place it in the year 2018 at earliest.” What do you think about Paul Sztorc’s proposal to revise Bitcoin’s scaling roadmap?

2017-07-13T22:00:23-04:00,August 1 and the Potential Disruption of the Bitcoin Network,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/august-1-potential-disruption-bitcoin-network/,"If you’ve been listening to the bitcoin ‘community,’ you’d know that in about two weeks the bitcoin network may face some protocol changes. Due to the possible user-activated soft fork (UASF) planned and the chance some groups may counter this plan, this has created thousands of discussions concerning August 1. Now the bitcoin-focused web portal Bitcoin.org has issued a warning on the site that informs users of a “potential network disruption.” Also read: Mining, Merchants, and Traders—Thailand’s Got the Bitcoin Fever Bitcoin users everywhere are getting prepared and heavily discussing the possibility of a blockchain split. The subject was discussed a lot this past March when bitcoin proponents and cryptocurrency businesses feared a potential split when the Bitcoin Unlimited implementation was seeing strong support. Now the conversation has resurfaced, but the topic of UASF or BIP148 is an entirely different scenario.  UASF (BIP148) is a mechanism designed to start on August 1st, at 00:00 UTC that activates a soft fork enforced by full nodes. After this point, full nodes participating in this plan will reject blocks that have not upgraded to BIP141 otherwise known as Segregated Witness (Segwit). At press time there are 1095 total UASF nodes out of 7896 reachable bitcoin nodes globally according to Bitnodes. UASF requires a lot of industry support and miners to activate Segwit, by this point if they do not support the activation the chain could diverge into two.  Currently, there are businesses that have announced initial support for BIP148 such as Abra, Trezor, Samourai Wallet, Electrum, Coinomi, Mycelium and roughly 37 other organizations. However, there are many wallets and a vast majority of exchanges that have not announced any support or issued warnings about the upcoming August 1st Segwit enforcement. This includes a significant amount of wallet providers and exchanges including Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex, Gemini, BTCC, Poloniex, and many more. One relatively small exchange in Switzerland called Bity has warned its customers the platform will be halting trading on August 1st.   On Wednesday, July 12, 2017, 08:00:00 GMT Bitcoin.org issued a warning in regards to the potential network disruption that may take place on July 31, 20:00:00 GMT/August 1st, 00:00 UTC. “Bitcoin confirmation scores may become unreliable for an unknown length of time,” explains the network disruption warning. “This means that any bitcoins you receive after that time may later disappear from your wallet or be a type of bitcoin that other people will not accept as payment.”  The warning gives users some preparation guidelines and possible outcomes for during and after the UASF event. This includes not trusting payments during this time, and not sending payments until after the dust has settled. Even the maintainer of the website Bitcoinuptime.com says that there may be “potential bitcoin downtime from the upcoming BIP148 fork” and the network’s 99.991523267% uptime will have to be updated. Further, there was an issue concerning the Bitcoin.org alert over the wording “Bitcoin may be unsafe to use starting July 31st” in contrast to saying “potential network disruption.” The developer who made the change writes; Following Bitcoin.org’s disruption alert one large bitcoin exchange has come forward issuing a warning and how the company will handle the August 1 situation. The cryptocurrency trading platform GDAX, a subset of Coinbase announced there will be a temporary suspension of deposits, withdrawals, and possibly trading on August 1. GDAX executive Adam White says, “the activation of UASF may create two blockchains,” and outlines how the company plans on handling the possible fork. If August 1 results in two chains, GDAX states; Another possible scenario to think about is the “Bitcoin ABC” (Adjustable Blocksize Cap) implementation that was revealed by the software engineer, Amaury Séchet at The Future of Bitcoin event in Arnhem. The project has released its latest client Bitcoin ABC 0.14.2 and says it’s a full node implementation of Bitcoin that removes Segwit code and replaces it with an adjustable block size cap. During the initial announcement, Séchet detailed that Bitcoin ABC is part of the user-activated hard fork contingency plan against BIP148.  In essence, the ABC protocol prepares for any disruptive risks associated with UASF activation and could also activate during the August 1st “Flag Day” as well. Besides being a contingency plan, the UAHF protocol will move the block size cap towards the activation of emergent consensus where users can decide block size themselves. Bitcoin ABC could counter the BIP148 soft fork which could cause network disruption, and a possible blockchain split as well. Alongside these two alternative plans, the Segwit2x working group has also been steadily preparing the compromise idea announced called the “New York Agreement.” The group released beta code and have been experimenting with the Segwit protocol and a 2MB hard fork on a Bitcoin testnet. So far there has been a lot of bickering about Segwit2x between the project’s lead developer Jeff Garzik, Bitcoin core developers, and the Blockstream CEO Adam Back. Many core supporters refuse to compromise on Segwit2x calling it “Franken-segwit” and a great majority of core developers have rejected supporting the idea. However, some core maintainers have been making comments on Segwit2x’s Github and the working group’s Slack channel. There is still uncertainty concerning the New York Agreement plan, but the working group is still moving along as August 1st gets closer. As far as August 1st is concerned users should make sure they hold their private keys. There is a possibility of network disruption and Bitcoin.com will inform our readers of everything people need to know, including exchange updates, trading, withdrawal and deposit suspensions, and any other important information that arises in regards to this specific date. What do you think about August 1st? Do you think there will be any potential network disruption or do you think nothing will happen at all? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

Fintech companies in the country will be able to obtain a permit allowing them to legally offer Bitcoin international transfer services. Also read: South Korea Sets Up Task Force to Determine if Bitcoin Needs Regulations Starting on July 18, the amended South Korean Foreign Exchange Transactions Act will enable fintech companies to register with the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) to legally “provide international money transfer services for small funds,” The Herald reported an FSS official saying on Wednesday. Once registered, companies can use various methods to send money abroad, including using Bitcoin. The amended law specifically permits digital currency remittances, “which were illegal under the Foreign Exchange Transactions law,” wrote online newspaper Dailian. To obtain a permit, a fintech firm must have a paid-in capital of more than 2 billion won (approx. 1.75 mUSD at the time of writing) and a debt-to-equity ratio of below 200 percent, The Herald explained, adding that: The amended law will allow new entrants to compete with traditional banks, offering money transfer services at a fraction of the incumbents’ fees, with a shorter transfer time. For an overseas remittance of 1 million won, a typical bank commission is between 50,000 won and 60,000 won, Dailian detailed, adding that fintech companies are expected to charge between 3,000 to 40,000 won. It also takes banks two or three days to complete a transfer, the publication wrote. Meanwhile, Bitcoin remittance service provider Coinone only charges a 1% commission fee and “deposits are made within 3 minutes after requesting money transfer,” its website shows. Responding to new fintech competitors, Keb Hana Bank has limited some of its transfer fees to around 10,000 won, and Shinhan Bank is considering the introduction of a Bitcoin-based overseas remittance system, The Herald reported. Kang Mi-jung, a senior researcher at Hana Institute of Finance, commented: The worldwide money transfer industry is expected to grow to approximately $600 billion this year, according to research by Infosys. About 40 fintech firms are slated to launch international money transfer services starting on August 15, the news outlet reported FSS officials saying, adding that “the move is expected to intensify competition in the 10 trillion won ($8.7 billion) international money transfer market.” Do you think Bitcoin remittances will overtake traditional bank transfers?

Also read: Japanese Bitcoin Exchange Bitpoint Expands into Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan European bitcoin broker Bitpanda was founded in October 2014 as Coinimal. The Vienna startup rebranded as Bitpanda in June 2016. The company claims to have over 300,000 users currently, with almost 200 million euros in transaction volume. On Tuesday, Bitpanda announced that bitcoin, ether, dash, and litecoin can now be purchased at all postal locations throughout Austria. According to the Post’s website, there are “more than 1,800 postal branches and Austrian Post partners throughout Austria.” Bitpanda believes that by partnering with the Post, it will increase both its user base as well as its transaction volume. The company’s co-founder Eric Demuth said: At any post office counter in Austria, customers can buy Bitpanda’s paper vouchers in denominations of 50, 100 or 500 euros. After purchasing, they will receive a code per voucher to redeem for their choice of the four cryptocurrencies on the Bitpanda website.  This service is called “Bitpanda to go” and is exclusively offered through the Post. “All you need is an email address,” the company explained. There are currently three verification levels; starter, bronze, and gold. A fourth level, silver, will be coming soon. Only the starter level is needed to redeem vouchers, which only requires an email address to verify. For other services, “the verification level of your account determines how many bitcoins you can buy/sell each day. A higher verification level will lead to higher limits in your account,” the company detailed. Bitpanda is not the first to offer physically-sold, redeemable vouchers for bitcoin. In nearby France, the European bitcoin broker Bitit offers prepaid gift cards for euros that work similarly to Bitpanda’s vouchers. The cards are now part of a network of physical gift cards that are sold at over 150,000 locations across Europe, according to the exchange. South Korea’s Coinplug exchange also sells bitcoins at convenience stores. Their vouchers called Okbitcards are available at over 4,000 7-11 and Ministop locations across the country, redeemable through a smartphone app. In Canada, Bitaccess offers a similar service using Flexepin vouchers at 6,000 locations.

Also Read: Rollout of 260,000+ Bitcoin-Accepting Stores in Japan Begins  Japanese bitcoin exchange Btcbox will be establishing a Hong Kong bitcoin exchange subsidiary in partnership with investment bank MBK Co. Ltd. The proposed subsidiary, MBK Asia Limited, this week announced that it has filed for registration as an incorporation within Hong Kong. Btcbox has been operating since 2014, making it one of the oldest bitcoin exchanges in Japan. Since 2016 the company has increasingly geared its operations toward altcoin trading. Despite its longevity, Btcbox has struggled to capture a significant share of the Japanese cryptocurrency markets, posting the first profitable single month in the company’s entire history this May. Japanese investment bank MBK has already reaped benefits from its pending entry into Hong Kong’s cryptocurrency markets. The recent liberalization of Japan’s regulatory stance toward bitcoin and dramatic rise in price seen by many cryptocurrencies have inspired sharp gains in the share price of Japanese businesses with exposure to virtual currencies – with MBK’s shares rising in price by approximately 17% since February.  MBK has traditionally engaged in the provision of equity investment, debt financing, fund management, and merger and acquisition advisory. The move to enter the cryptocurrency markets is a notable diversification for MBK, which was first founded in 1947 and has traditionally been associated with Japan’s post-war manufacturing and merchant banking sectors. The establishment of Btcbox’s subsidiary has been largely inspired by Japan’s permissive regulatory climate, with the company perceiving recent regulations as a likely catalyst for both recent and future growth. “In April of this year, demand for virtual currencies has been increasing more than ever since the ‘revised fund settlement law’ etc. came into effect in order to optimize the service on the virtual currency. Btcbox has also seen an increase in customer assets under management expected from an increase in new customers, as well as an increase in sales of bitcoin.” The Hong Kong-based subsidiary also announced future plans to negotiate partnerships to provide remittance and settlement services to the international finance markets.

Citing that “Taiwan has independent monetary policies under a different business practice from mainland China,” Bitpoint said the region “is expected to be more active in digital currency trading going forward.” The company added: Taiwan is Bitpoint’s latest expansion. Last month, the company announced that it is launching a bitcoin exchange in Hong Kong called Bitpoint Global, through a joint venture with Top Wisdom Accounting and Consulting Ltd. The new exchange is expected to start service on July 28.  The company said at the time: The launches in Taiwan and Hong Kong follow the company’s February expansion into mainland China, through a partnership with Galaxy Dragonfly Investments Co.

He seemed to see digital tokens as representing a threat, and he urged regulators to be more “paternalistic” in their oversight of ICO’s.  Also read: Protestors Will Watch Mt Gox CEO Face Criminal Trial This Week Hauser elaborated on his position, saying, “We have to address today what is happening with bitcoin, blockchain and ICOs that are challenging the current regulation around the world. It is here at the gates of the stock exchange. It is a new economy where the companies have no faces, and the investors have no faces. Our task is to get ready now in a proactive fashion before an event will occur that will hurt Israeli investors.” In this sense, it appears Hauser is attempting to alert regulators of the world to prepare for more digital currencies and ICO’s to spread. Hauser suggested many people invest in digital currencies and they do not understand them. He implied they need government protection, because 67% of people cannot look after themselves. Overall, 60% of the public have been exposed to digital investment opportunities. Hauser mentioned bitcoin is not a passing fad. It is here to stay. Regulators have to be prepared. He said the SEC recently rejected a bitcoin ETF. He said this because regulators do not yet comprehend cryptocurrency. They do not know how to go about creating a regulatory framework. He also mentioned there are already IPO’s without a prospectus. He finished his thought by asking one important question: does the world even need regulators anymore? Hauser answered his own question by bringing up the topic of ICO’s and how they should be regulated. Currently, he said ICO’s are funds that are generated via the creation of blockchain, bitcoin, and similar cryptocurrencies, and they ignore the current supervisory system. In other words, there is no oversight or protection for investors or speculators. Hauser then detailed all the different ICO’s and the kind of revenue they have generated, saying, “Israeli Bancor, which raised $153 million in three hours for a conversion protocol; Gnosis, which raised $12.5 million in ten minutes for building a platform for predicting events; Brave, which raised $35 million in 24 seconds for developing a browser; Aragon, which raised $25 million in 15 minutes for decentralizing companies; and more.”  He asked what these new tokens should be considered for regulatory purposes. He started thinking out loud. They are not like business IPO’s. Investors do not actually gain ownership in the company. Nor did the startup undergo any kind of organizational process or submit a prospectus to a regulatory agency. The ICO simply generates new tokens and people invest in it because it could harbor value in the future. Hauser admitted these new digital assets are not like a stocks or bonds. They are a different animal entirely. In his final analysis, Hauser said cryptocurrencies in an ICO are closer to an IPO in some regards, and he believes that is a starting point to begin thinking about outlining some regulations.

Also read: The Japanese are Using Bitcoin More than Expected On Monday, Nikkei reported that Japanese electronics giant Bic Camera will start accepting bitcoin at all of its locations across Japan. The publication detailed: Bic Camera first started accepting bitcoin in April, following the government’s recognition of the digital currency. By partnering with Bitflyer, Japan’s top bitcoin exchange by volume, two Bic Camera stores started allowing bitcoin payments. The company’s executives said at the time that these stores would serve as a testbed for bitcoin. If successful, the chain may roll out a bitcoin payment option to all of its stores across Japan. Last month, the company opened a new store which is located in Akihabara, the world’s leading technology district. It became the third Bic Camera store to accept bitcoin. According to The Hokkaido Shimbun on Monday, Bic Camera “judged that there is demand not only for foreign visitors to Japan but also for Japanese customers.” While Nikkei did not specify a date, local publications indicate that the group will start rolling out the bitcoin payment option on July 14. The Bic Camera group of stores consists of three brands; Bic Camera, Sofmap and Kojima. The latter two are subsidiaries of Bic Camera. As of August 2016, the group operates 39 Bic Camera stores, 31 Sofmap stores, and 139 Kojima stores, with more stores planned across Japan. Sofmap sells both new and used electronics. The company became a subsidiary of Bic Camera in 2006. Electronics retailer Kojima, which focuses on stores in Suburban areas, was acquired by Bic Camera in 2012. At the time, Bic Camera ranked fifth in the industry while Kojima ranked sixth, reported The Japan Times. The acquisition created the second largest retail electronics chain in Japan. While Sofmap was not mentioned in Monday’s announcement, Bic Camera specifically said that some of Kojima stores will accept bitcoin. According to Nikkei: Bic Camera is the latest major Japanese retail chain to integrate bitcoin payments. Last week, Recruit Lifestyle which partnered with bitcoin exchange Coincheck began rolling out a bitcoin payment option to 260,000+ stores that use its point-of-sale app, Air Regi. Meanwhile, another Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitpoint is working independently to introduce bitcoin payments to over 100,000 retailers through partnerships with large corporations such as Peach Aviation and Evolable Asia.

That is what a July 4 European Union report suggested. This will not strike many people as obvious, though. One of the most common concerns touted by governments about bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is criminals will use them to fund their activities.  Also read: The Reason Why Bitcoin Miners Dedicate Time to Mining Empty Blocks The EU’s commission Staff document detailed, “While they (criminals) may have a high intent to use due to VCs characteristics (anonymity in particular), the level of capability is lower due to high technology required.” This low level of capability implies criminals lack understanding of cryptocurrencies and have little technological acumen. After the report mentioned the low incidence of criminal use, it added terrorists may try to use “virtual currencies” like bitcoin to finance some operations. The report said the level of anonymity of virtual currencies provides a modicum of risk, because it plays into the hands of terror cells and other nefarious organizations. In other words, people with violent intentions can use these currencies in a secretive way to fund bombing campaigns or other violent activities. It currently seems unlikely, however, considering the technology is still developing/emerging, the report stated. “It is nevertheless important to mention that being currently a developing technology requiring IT skills and expertise, virtual currencies are not necessarily easy to use and the number of transactions is still quite low.” The biggest fear the EU report pointed out centered on the regulation status of bitcoin and other “virtual currencies.” The fact that these cryptocurrencies are essentially unregulated means there are few reporting and tracking mechanisms in place. The report concluded since suspicious transactions cannot be monitored, are borderless, international, anonymous, and no one has duty to report strange activity to the Financial Intelligence Unit, the risk of vulnerability for financial terrorism remains high.

2017-07-10T11:00:11-04:00,The Reason Why Bitcoin Miners Dedicate Time to Mining Empty Blocks,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/reason-bitcoin-miners-empty-blocks/,"Bitcoin mining is an intriguing subject that can sometimes be overwhelming to understand at first without some research. One particular subject concerning the topic of mining is empty blocks, and people often wonder why mining pools mine them. Also read: Class Action Lawsuit Filed Against Cryptocurrency Exchange Kraken Mining pools are groups of bitcoin miners that work together to find and verify blocks roughly every ten minutes. Most of the time blocks are filled with transactions that are waiting to be confirmed as soon as the miner finds a specific block. Miners are rewarded 12.5 BTC and all the fees associated with the particular block they find. In the early days, blocks were not that full because bitcoin wasn’t as popular as it is today. Lately blocks have been full, often to the maximum size of 1 MB. Blocks filled with transactions are not the only blocks mined on the network as empty blocks are mined as well. Empty blocks actually do have a transaction in them called the coinbase which is included first in every block. The main reason why pools mine empty blocks is because they are performing operations non-stop. Now the biggest qualm people have with miners who dedicate energy to mining an empty block is due to the recent throughput congestion these days. However, when a pool solves a block, it has to download it and perform a few functions in order for it to verify the contained transactions. At the same time, the pool is also receiving the next broadcasted header (80 bytes of data tethered to a block), and the pool begins working on its next block. Not only are miners dedicating time to mining they also have to take inventory of the blocks mined by competitors. Miners do not stop to rest, they are continuously looking to mine as many blocks as they can. It’s sort of like a Nascar driver winning the Daytona 500 but also the driver is looking to get pole position at a race in Talladega literally seconds after completing the Daytona race. Professor of computer science and well-known bitcoiner, Jorge Stolfi, gives a simple explanation to why a miner would mine an empty block. “The transaction fees are an incentive for miners to include all the transactions that they can in their candidate blocks,” explains Stolfi. “However, a miner often can start mining a candidate for block N+1 even before he has seen what was included in block N. That’s because he only needs the hash of block N, and he often can get it very quickly by a certain trick.” Empty blocks have been common since bitcoin’s inception. For instance, from the Genesis block all the way to block 360189 there were 85295 empty blocks mined on the blockchain. That means from January 2009 to June 2015 — approximately 23.68 percent of all blocks were empty. The work put into mining an empty block is no different than one filled to the max capacity. Since 2015 mining empty blocks has decreased and some pools say they abstain from mining them at all. Currently, the total one transaction blocks mined to date is 87885. The idea that miners are choosing to mine the empty blocks is true to a degree but whether it’s bad or not is a different story. The debate on the empty block topic has been argued for years since the early days.  What’s your opinion on the topic of empty blocks? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-07-09T21:00:33-04:00,Creating a Bitcoin Bank in Less Than Thirty Minutes With a $2 USB Drive,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-bank-less-thirty-minutes-usb-drive/,"There are multiple ways people can store bitcoins offline, using either a paper wallet or hardware options from companies like Trezor, Opendime, Ledger, and Keepkey. However, bitcoin users can also create a bitcoin wallet on a far cheaper USB thumb drive as well to store coins offline. Also Read: How Much Does it Cost to Run a Full Node? Today we’re going to detail how to create a secure bitcoin wallet with an inexpensive USB drive. There are a few different wallets you can download for this particular operation, but for this walkthrough, we will use an Electrum wallet. Other lightweight bitcoin clients used should follow a similar installation process. The first thing you want to do is download the Electrum wallet to your computer. The software can be used on Mac OS, Windows and Linux systems and takes only a few minutes to download. To maximize security users should add an operating system (OS) to the flash drive. This means creating a bootable USB stick with an OS like the privacy-centric Tails or Ubuntu.  Without adding a bootable OS, wallet data may be stored elsewhere on the computer or be vulnerable to malware if your computer is infected. A bootable drive is a thousand times more secure than a simple offline installation. The next step after downloading the wallet software is to install it directly on the USB drive’s OS offline. It’s not the best idea to use the USB thumb drive for any other online applications, and the drive should be utilized solely as a bitcoin wallet, but of course, that’s optional. Following the USB drive installation, you can opt to shut off your internet services and local area connection to perform the installation offline. It’s a good idea to safely remove the USB and restart your computer as well before installation. After a system reboot and you are sure your operating system is offline you can then plug the USB device back into the computer for the next steps. If you chose to add a Linux OS to the flash drive, after the internet is shut down you can boot up the OS on the USB with confidence because you are using a fresh operating system offline. Following the reboot proceed to the next steps. Next, after the OS boots up navigate to the USB drive folder and open the installer program for the wallet. The client won’t be able to connect to the Bitcoin network, but you can still create a new wallet. The installation procedure is the same, and the new wallet app needs to be installed into the USB drive’s operating system as well. Then, you’ll be directed through the security section where you should create a strong password and write down your seed phrase. Always remember if you lose the password or seed phrase you will not be able to recover your bitcoins on that wallet. After you secure your wallet with an encrypted passphrase and get your seed, you will then have a fresh new wallet that can send and receive bitcoins. Just like a hardware wallet, you will need the device to access your keys, and you will also be able to restore it with a seed if the USB stick was lost, damaged or stolen. This method can cost you less than $2 for a generic USB drive which is far cheaper than $60-150 hardware products. A simple installation without a bootable system is less secure than using a live cd with an OS like tails but that’s entirely your security choice. Further, with some directions, flash drives can also be used as a bearer bond instrument by just handing someone some bitcoin off-chain.  Have you tried installing a bitcoin wallet to a blank USB drive? Let us know about your experience in the comments below.

Also read: Russian Politician Proposes Central Bank Follow Japan’s Lead to Legalize Bitcoin In Russia’s Leningrad region which surrounds St. Petersburg, Vladimir Petrov is the Deputy in the region’s Legislative Assembly, Marina Chistova is Head of the Slantsy district, and Viktor Karpenko is the mayor of Ivangorod. Last week, the three formally requested for the Bank of Russia to “legalize the circulation and exchange of cryptocurrencies in the border areas of the Leningrad region,” according to the local publication Vesti. Three border districts were named in particular; Kingiseppsky, Slantsevsky, and Vyborgsky. Within the region, the Kingiseppsky and Slantsevsky districts border Estonia whereas Vyborgsky borders Finland. Their administrative centers are the towns of Kingisepp, Slantsy, and Vyborg respectively. Petrov said, as quoted by Abc.az news portal: Petrov explained that the Leningrad region borders multiple European Union countries, where bitcoin adoption is much further ahead of his country. For example, it is actively used in Estonia, he detailed. However, transit passengers from border countries arriving in Russia may not have the correct currency to spend, the news outlet detailed. Allowing cryptocurrency payment in border areas “could help boost the number of visitors, both from the European and Russian side,” he said. The publication conveyed Petrov’s message: The Russian ombudsman for business rights, Dmitry Marinichev, supports the idea of politicians lobbying for the use of cryptocurrencies in the Leningrad region, reported Vesti. “In general, I support the idea of people using cryptocurrencies. Even though the proposal is of a populist nature, I support it because so many people are beginning to understand how it functions,” he said (loosely translated), adding that it offers a variety of new technological innovations in their lives.

In recent weeks, a high-profile UK art gallery has announced that it will accept cryptocurrencies, a painting has been purchased by a Hong Kong collector using bitcoin, and multiple art exhibits have sought to visually represent virtual currency. Also Read: Poland’s Largest Food Delivery with 5000+ Restaurants Starts Accepting Bitcoin Bitcoin has been making headlines in the arts industries in recent weeks, with many high profile representatives of the arts either accepting bitcoin as a means of payment or producing works that explore cryptocurrency conceptually.  Dadiani Fine Art, a contemporary art gallery located in the UK, announced this week that it will offer buyers the opportunity to purchase art using bitcoin, ethereum, ethereum classic, ripple, litecoin, or dash. Cryptocurrency payments will be accepted at the upcoming Dandiani exhibition, ‘The Noise’, which will showcase sculptures made from racing memorabilia. The gallery’s owner, Eleesa Dadiani, hopes that accepting cryptocurrency payments will open up the arts industry to “a new type of buyer”, stating that “Cryptocurrencies will provide a bridge from the elitist, centralist fine art market to a decentralised open-source world where many more will be able to become a part of this exhilarating market.” Dadiani also believes that greater adoption of bitcoin within the creative industries comprises a significant step towards mainstream adoption of cryptocurrency. “This could be a turning point for the crypto-currency market. For many years, it has been ridiculed but when traditional businesses, such as galleries, take it seriously it is a sure sign that this is a very important technology.” A Hong Kong art collector is also reported to have used bitcoin to purchase a painting recently. In late June, Romanian artist Stefania Nistoreanu sold the painting for two bitcoins, which at the time equated to roughly $4,500 USD. The painting, titled ‘Cryptsy’, is an oil and gold leaf on canvas piece that the artist says incorporates mathematical elements derived from cryptocurrency, and was listed alongside another of Nistoreanu’s works on Bitpremier.  June saw a number of artistic representations of cryptocurrency make headlines, with Los Angeles-based artist Matthias Dorfelt’s ‘Block Bills’ also enjoying coverage from both arts and cryptocurrency media outlets. Block Bills comprises a visual depiction of 64 randomly chosen blocks from the bitcoin blockchain. Mexican artist, Antonio Vega Macotela, has also recently explored cryptocurrency through art, with his installation ‘Mill of Blood‘ currently being hosted at Germany’s largest art fair, Documenta 14. Reuters reports that Mill of Blood seeks to examine “the global economy and humanity”, and encourages audience members to “push a wheel on the ‘Mill of Blood’ that produces a metallic coin and a digital bitcoin.” Macotela has described the piece as being “reminiscent of mills used in Mexico and Bolivia to mint coins, using the labor of animals and slaves.” What do you think of artists’ attempts to represent cryptocurrency? Share your thoughts in the comments section below!

They said these currencies are not national or legal tender and cannot be used to pay taxes. They do not fall within the guidelines provided by Polish Financial Supervision Authority. Businesses, especially, should be wary about adopting or trying to use “virtual currencies.”  Also read: Breadwallet Boots Up The Bitcoin Therapy Hotline The authority’s warning read, “Polish National Bank and Financial Supervision Commission report that “virtual currencies” are not issued or guaranteed by the central bank of the state, not money, ie. They are not legal tender, or currency, can not be used to pay off tax liabilities and do not meet the criterion of general acceptance in retail outlets” The article, however, did mention that “virtual currencies” currently do not violate EU or national law. They just allegedly harbor a laundry list of risks, and people should recognize these risks before getting involved in the digital currency landscape. The Polish authorities said that risk of theft is a huge problem in the space. This is especially the cause when an exchange is used to facilitate trade. “Virtual currencies” are not guaranteed by the bank either, since they are not bank deposits. The Polish authorities also said the currency is not “universally accepted” at retail outlets, and this makes it challenging to use and provides opportunities for being defrauded. Lastly, the article said that these types of money may be nothing more than a “pyramid scheme.” In this regard, if an investor fell prey to this kind of scheme, the only kind of “protection would be criminal,” read the article. There is allegedly no legal institution that has an obligation to protect investors from this kind of dupe. The Polish authorities say it would not be a wise investment to purchase these assets given their risk assessment. They are against using exchanges to purchase, manage, or otherwise be involved in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. The site even said it would be risky if investors were regulated and added: This warning comes as more Polish restaurants and eateries have begun to accept bitcoin as a method of payment. Poland’s largest food delivery service, with 5000+ restaurants, recently started accepting the digital currency.

Bitcoin.com reached out to Lasher to investigate if it was a joke or a sincere attempt at helping people. Lasher said, Lasher said he started the hotline for a specific reason.

The hotline is also free for anyone to call and Breadwallet does not have expectations of compensation for services rendered. Even though Lasher mentioned he will discuss anything with anyone regarding bitcoin woes, his blog did offer some guidelines and limitations. The blog entry said it is not a customer support hotline, nor are anyone who answers licensed therapists. There is also a chance discussions may be limited to 10 minutes due to high demand for the service.

Also read: Russia’s Central Bank Drafting Proposal to Classify Bitcoins as Digital Goods Boris Titov is a Russian politician and the Presidential Commissioner for Entrepreneurs’ Rights. In a letter to the head of the Russian Central Bank Elvira Nabiullina, he proposed that the bank follows the Japanese model in regulating digital currencies like bitcoin and ether, reported the Russian business daily Vedomosti on Friday. Titov pointed out that Japan has recognized digital currency as a means of payment, not as money. He then outlined three outcomes of the Japanese regulations applicable to Russia. Firstly, cryptocurrency exchanges are now regulated in Japan. They are required to register with the government as well as implement strict anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) measures. For example, they must regularly monitor and report any suspicious activities to the authorities, Titov explained. Secondly, he noted that the regulations are imposed on the management of assets, and the exchanges are subject to regular audit by the financial authorities. This is to protect cryptocurrency-using customers. “Japan has also introduced procedures for dealing with claims,” he added. Thirdly, he conveyed that Japan has removed VAT on purchases and sales of digital currency but not VAT on purchases. However, he noted that the Japanese National Tax Agency has not yet clarified how to deal with income tax or corporate tax levied on digital currency transactions. Currently, the Russian Ministry of Finance and the central bank are discussing whether digital currency should be regulated. The Finance Ministry has promised to submit proposals to the government in the “near future,” Vedomosti reiterated. Deputy of the Russian Central Bank Olga Skorobogatova has proposed for cryptocurrencies to be considered digital goods for the purpose of monitoring and reporting taxes. Meanwhile, Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev said in early June that cryptocurrency regulation will be similar to the regulation of derivatives. His idea was echoed by Chairman of the State Duma Committee on Financial Markets Anatoly Aksakov, who stated that cryptocurrency should be considered a financial instrument on par with securities and derivatives. “These transactions are not subject to VAT, so should not be taxed,” the newspaper quoted Aksakov saying. He then suggested that cryptocurrency should be treated similarly. While Russia has not decided how to treat cryptocurrency, Aksakov said that discussions are underway on the terminology and definition of cryptocurrency. Responding to Titov’s proposal, Nikolai Legkodimov, a KPMG partner is “confident that Russia will be able to successfully adapt the Japanese model,” Vedomosti wrote. He then noted that light regulation may be attractive for the industry. Do you think the Russian government will decide to follow Japan’s lead? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-07-08T02:00:18-04:00,The Blockchain Split Scenario: Staying Informed and Backing Up Bitcoin Keys,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/blockchain-split-staying-informed-bitcoin-keys/,"In less than four weeks the Bitcoin network has many events on the horizon, and numerous things could happen during the weeks following. Also read: A Look at the Bitcoin Apps Being Built Using the Lightning Network Right now over the course of the next 3-4 months, there are many plans for the Bitcoin network. Often times at Bitcoin.com we have discussed this matter in great detail, but people still wonder what will happen to their bitcoin holdings if the blockchain splits. Several potential outcomes can happen with these particular three ideas; The user activated soft fork (UASF) that begins on August 1, Segwit2x which starts around mid-July to October, and the more recent Bitcoin ABC (UAHF) that might deploy in August. There’s a number of things that could happen with any one of these plans, but the biggest fear is the possibility of a chain split. A chain split is when the blockchain fractures into two chains due to the fact that consensus was not met during an upgrade. That means a particular portion of the Bitcoin network participants disagreed on the plan and chose to ignore the other side’s rules or protocol upgrade. This happened with the Ethereum network, and now there is another blockchain called Ethereum Classic. Now, just because the Bitcoin blockchain splits it doesn’t mean the smaller chain will survive. But the first and foremost thing every bitcoin holder should know if they both survive; If you hold your private keys during a chain split you will be able to retrieve tokens for both chains. That doesn’t mean you will double your money as one token will be worth considerably less than the chain with the most proof-of-work and possibly even be worthless. The chance of a smaller chain surviving with the current network difficulty for miners would be a tough thing to accomplish, and the chain would need a decent amount of support to survive. The new chain or the legacy chain does have a chance to grow longer than the other, and each chain will have a certain amount of hashrate. If there is a chain split the likeliness of significant price fluctuations and confusion is very probable. The best way to ensure your funds will be safe during a chain split is making sure you possess your private keys, backups, and make sure your seed and encryption phrases are secure. If you have possession of your keys, you don’t have to do anything but be patient and watch everything unfold. If you keep your money on an exchange or with a third party that possesses your bitcoin keys you will have to deal with the decisions they decide to make during and after a chain split. People often ask this when learning about the possibility of a chain split and it should be fairly obvious you must surrender to their control. There may be lots of confusion and exchanges may halt trading. Trading platforms may also disable deposits and withdrawals during these times as well. Some of the largest bitcoin exchanges or brokerage services could go offline, and you may not have access to your bitcoins. The point is; if they hold your funds you will have to abide by their rules, guidelines and possible unfavorable outcomes. During the next few weeks, people will have time to make sure their backups and seeds are in order and they can also move their funds off exchanges. However, the choice is entirely up to the user, and there will likely be many individuals who leave their bitcoins with third parties. Split or no split, giving the custodial rights to your bitcoins will always leave you at the mercy of that particular business or operation. Furthermore, there is also a chance that the bitcoin community participants do come to consensus and there is no chain split whatsoever. However just to be on the safe side, there are a few steps below detailing what people can do to make sure they hold their private keys and everything is backed up and safe for the next few months. Alongside this, there are also a few articles that go over chain splits, the upcoming scaling plans, cold storage solutions and more so you can further your knowledge about these subjects.

Ever since the bitcoin scaling dilemma surfaced, Theymos and his staff have been actively censoring opinions that remotely relate to expanding the block sizes or forking the bitcoin protocol, which was once called bitcoin improvement proposal 101 or BIP 101. Theymos admitted to using censorship tactics on November 4, 2015, saying, “You can promote BIP 101 as an idea. You can’t promote (on /r/Bitcoin) the actual usage of BIP 101. When the idea has consensus, then it can be rolled out.(archive)” He attempted to downplay the censorship by suggesting what he did was merely “moderate” rather than censor. In other words, he played word games to dilute the gravity of his actions. Nonetheless, evidence of censorship is legion on the r/bitcoin Reddit. For example, Brian Armstrong and company Coinbase strongly supported block-size extensions. Their content was deleted and Theymos later banned them from r/bitcoin. Compiling an exhaustive list of the censorship, bannings, and subterfuge enacted by Theymos over the years would take many articles to fully express (which it has). For more evidence of censorship and control committed by Theymos and other dictatorial autocrats on r/bitcoin see John Blocke’s informative two part article on the history of the subject. Over time, Theymos and his campaign of censorship manufactured the bitcoin community’s consent. It prompted bitcoiners to accept a plan of downgrading to Segwit and emboldening everyone to disembark from Satoshi Nakamoto’s original road map. Now the community enthusiastically rejects larger block sizes and instead embraces a suicidal course toward bitcoin centralization. How did this happen, though? How could the smartest, brightest, and most innovative be plainly duped into undermining bitcoin? It turns out they were manipulated rather easily. It did not take any amazing cunning or sleight of hand on part of Theymos. It just required his politically-motivated censorship campaign. As his campaign gradually infected the community, human psychology did the rest. Certain individuals praised Segwit and spun myths about its capabilities, while everyone else was effectively tongue-tied by “moderation.” These Segwit supporters hyped it as a superior upgrade and leveled hate speech against the few who managed to get a word in edgewise on expanding the blocksize. Without dissenters able to speak out, people began to embrace Segwit. This occurred by way of what psychologist Solomon Asche called informational conformity. It is a psychological effect that suggests people conform to others just because they provided information and no one refuted it. In the bitcoin space, it means just because Segwit promoters said positive things about Segwit, it convinced community members it was correct and good.
The absence of countervailing opinions—due to the rampant censorship—was enough to create the aforesaid psychological effect, leading to blind adoption of Segwit and the current toxic trajectory of bitcoin. A quote from Asche eloquently expresses how smart people in the community were likely led astray: After so many in the community were indeed willing to call white black, what happened next was likewise natural. The bandwagon effect took hold. This cultural phenomenon suggests people do something merely because others do it. It manifests within fields such as politics and consumer behavior, which means the bitcoin ecosystem is certainly susceptible to its influence. Jihan Wu, in his recent talk at The Future of Bitcoin Conference, said this is one of the premier biases that people in our tech-savvy environment have to be wary of and acknowledge. Arguably, informational conformity powered by an ongoing bandwagon effect has perverted the way bitcoiners think about their beloved protocol. It is the psychological explanation why otherwise intelligent people decided to adopt an “upgrade” that neuters bitcoin’s decentralized nature and paves a dangerous path for the network. The bitcoin community, then, is currently trapped in what some psychologists refer to as a consensus trance or consensus delusion. This is a state of consciousness where people passively believe what they are told, rather than what they themselves think. They are not reacting out of their own volition. They simply accept what others say without critical analysis. This unfortunate fact is what has driven some of brightest in the community to support an unnecessary and destructive implementation. It is the road that has led to the current predicament, where centralized adaptations for a decentralized network have been heralded as innovative. And where people who want to maintain bitcoin neutrality are erroneously accused of wanting to control the platform. The irony is a tragic symptom of the consensus delusion bitcoiners suffer under. If the community wants to survive this onslaught against bitcoin, they must snap out of their drunken haze and attend to the facts. They must remember the road map Nakamoto designed, and recall that on-chain scaling solutions and block-size expansions were a normal part of the upgrade process. They should overcome the tendency to conform and acknowledge that rampant censorship has placed bitcoin in the hands of usurpers who possess motivations that are suspect. No one wants high fees. No one wants slow transactions times. No one wants Fascist Coin. People want bitcoin, and not all is lost. The network can be salvaged. The future need not be dark. Below are informative videos illustrating experiments in conformity and the bandwagon effect. Education is the best medicine for recognizing our own psychological pitfalls.    How can we help bitcoiners to wake up to what is happening in the community?  Let us know in the comments below.

2017-07-07T06:00:23-04:00,Vontobel Bitcoin Tracker Certificate Gaining Popularity in Switzerland,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/vontobel-bitcoin-tracker-certificate-gaining-popularity-in-switzerland/,"A Swiss investment certificate that tracks the price of bitcoin is gaining popularity with investors. The Vontobel bitcoin certificate is one of the most-traded structured products on Switzerland’s largest stock exchange, according to a local publication. Also read: Britain’s Largest Broker Offers Exchange-Traded Bitcoin Investments The Vontobel bitcoin tracker certificate was launched in 2016 and is listed on Switzerland’s largest stock exchange, the Six Swiss Exchange. Since its launch, the firm saw “considerable demand” for the tracker certificate and subsequently raised its issue size a couple of times. On Thursday, a Swiss/German-language daily newspaper published by the NZZ Media Group, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung, reported: The product trades under the symbol ZXBTUV with bitcoin priced in USD as the underlying asset. The certificate has a two-year term. The first day of trading was on July 15, 2016, and the last day of trading will be on July 16, 2018. “Between those dates, investors will be able to trade the Vontobel certificate on the secondary market, i.e. buying or selling at the applicable bid/offer prices,” the firm explained. Roger Studer, Head of Vontobel Investment Banking, said this bitcoin certificate “will for the first time give investors a simple and transparent means of investing in bitcoins on the Six Swiss Exchange.” Redemption is in cash, equal to the price of bitcoin at the certificate’s maturity. Established in 1924, Swiss private bank Vontobel specializes in wealth and asset management for private clients and institutional investors. With 21 international locations, the firm also offers investment and private banking services. At the end of 2016, it held CHF 195 billion of client assets. Citing the complexity of acquiring digital currencies, the Neue Zürcher Zeitung wrote that “there are a lot of questions to ask the potential investor such as: what crypto you should buy, should you do it directly on a stock exchange or with a broker, do you need a web wallet for the coins, and what to do with the elliptical code.” These questions are why bitcoin tracker certificates and similar standardized investment products are welcomed by Swiss investors, the publication quoted an asset manager saying. Investors in Switzerland feel that trading bitcoins with a Swiss bank carries a significantly smaller risk, he continued, adding that “one does not have to invest on a bitcoin platform, which many asset managers consider unsafe.” Meanwhile, two other bitcoin tracker certificates are also gaining popularity globally. Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Tracker Eur issued by XBT Provider recently announced having achieved $100 million in assets under management, due to “rapidly escalating” demand from investors. This announcement followed the two products’ listing by Britain’s largest broker, Hargreaves Lansdown. Would you invest in Vontobel bitcoin tracker certificates?

The company is on its way to become the first federally-regulated bitcoin options exchange and clearinghouse. Also read: Ledger Holdings Generates $11.4 Million to Open U.S. Bitcoin Options Exchange The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) announced on Thursday that it has granted Ledgerx LLC the status of a Swap Execution Facility (SEF). SEFs are platforms that operate under the CFTC’s regulatory oversight for the trading of swaps. The agency stated that after reviewing Ledgerx’s application and associated exhibits, it has determined that the company demonstrated compliance with the Commodity Exchange Act and the agency’s regulations applicable to SEFs. “With this order, there now are 25 SEFs registered with the CFTC,” the agency noted. However, there are only two with bitcoin investment products, Ledgerx and Tera Exchange. The latter was granted the SEF status in May 2016. In May, Ledgerx’s parent company Ledger Holdings received funding of $11.4 million. “These investments will further our application to become a regulated exchange and clearinghouse for bitcoin options,” Ledgerx CEO Paul Chou said at the time. Ledgerx had two applications with the CFTC. The first was to become a SEF, for which it received temporary registration approval from the Commission in September 2015 and now full registration status on Thursday. The second application is to become a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO), which any clearinghouse must register as before providing clearing services for futures contracts, options on futures contracts, and swaps. If the latter is also approved, “Ledgerx would be the first federally-regulated bitcoin options exchange and clearinghouse to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled bitcoin options for the institutional market”, the company claims, adding that: In an interview with Bitcoin.com in February, Chou explained that initially Ledgerx will list bitcoin vanilla puts and calls with standardized strikes and expirations. “Strikes will be in a range around the current spot price and expirations will be from one-to-six months in tenor,” he said, adding that the products will be listed on the Ledgerx SEF and cleared by the Ledgerx DCO, once approved. The company aims to be “an integrated exchange and clearing operation so all parts of the transaction lifecycle from contract listing, trade matching, to final settlement are handled by us,” Chou described. While Ledgerx is not the first bitcoin derivatives platform to become a SEF, it will be the first to receive both the SEF status as well as the DCO status, if approved. The platform will then be the first to operate as both a bitcoin swap exchange and a clearinghouse under the CFTC’s oversight. Will you trade on Ledgerx’s platform?

2017-07-07T01:00:36-04:00,A Look at the Bitcoin Apps Being Built Using the Lightning Network,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-apps-built-lightning-network/,"On June 5 the Lightning Network Community published a blog post about the emerging developer ecosystem being built around the ‘Lnd’ Lightning Network infrastructure and the many applications being constructed using the codebase. The post revealed some tipping bots, a Mac GUI wallet, and other types of platforms modeled with the alpha release of Lnd.  Also read: Diane Reynolds: `Lightning Network Will Maintain Decentralization´ This past January Bitcoin.com reported on the Lightning Network alpha release which is a full implementation of Lightning called Lnd. Since then a lot has been going on with the Lightning project as developers are testing the code and building applications. This past April the team used the Lnd framework and bitcoin testnet coins to purchase beer at the popular Room 77 bar in Berlin. Although the project is still in it’s alpha phase, Lightning Network programmers say that developers are using Lnd to build “application-level projects (Lapps)” and new utilities that could benefit the bitcoin ecosystem.   “Lnd is still in alpha, but we’re already seeing a handful of developers building on top of it,” explains the Lightning Network developers. “Starting first with application-level projects, a few user interfaces, and concluding with repositories and utilities that developers on Lightning will find helpful.” The first application mentioned, a Slack Tipbot, was created by software developer François Masurel. The tipbot was built for the Slack community, and the team calls it “the Lnd-based successor to Changetip.” Users just type “/lntip <amount in satoshis> @<Slack username>” to send a tip using Masurel’s micropayment enabled Lightning tipbot. The software is in its alpha form and is not yet intended for production details the tipbot’s warning. Other projects built using the Lnd framework that offer a “user interface” theme include the Mac OS graphical user interface (GUI) wallet designed by Alex Bosworth. The wallet is the first user interface for Macintosh computers that utilizes the Lightning protocol. Another platform is the lightweight Lnd Dashboard created by François Masurel that offers a web client and dashboard for Lnd that’s written in the NodeJS codebase. Additionally, there is a mobile and desktop Lightning platform produced by Jack Mallers. The application aims to support bitcoin, litecoin and has already been tested to purchase coffee. Back in April Bitcoin.com reported on the “Bcoin Hackathon” at the San Francisco-based Hackreactor HQ that featured over fifty developers messing around with the Bcoin protocol. The co-founder of Lightning, Olaoluwa Osuntokun (Roasbeef), was also in attendance, and the crowd witnessed a project called the “Monetizing Full Node Project.” The Lightning team details that the platform’s creators Michael Folkson, Alex Bosworth, and Nathan Basanese are continuing to work on this project utilizing Lnd for the payment network, Bcoin for full nodes, and Risk Bazaar for “risk contract” purposes. Another project designed with Lnd infrastructure is called “Voltachain — a pay-as-you-go solution for electric vehicle energy purchases.” Voltachain uses Lnd for micropayments, and the team just recently showcased their project at the Merkleweek Hackathon in Paris. Additionally, the platform is an open peer-to-peer application that developers can use for any vending service they’d like to create. The project is one of the first to apply bitcoin micropayments to the energy industry, and the team took first place at the Merkleweek Hackathon. The Lightning Network team also reveals a bunch more developing tools and resources throughout the blog post and explain a full site dedicated to these Lnd-based tools is currently being built. The team says there is plenty of resources and guides available now for individuals and organizations to start creating with the Lnd framework. What do you think about the applications built using the Lightning Network and Lnd? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Pixabay, the Lightning Network team blog, and the Bcoin Hackathon.

They are curious how they can get banks involved in leveraging cryptocurrencies, because they do not want to be left in the dust. However, some of them are also scared for the banking industry. In their eyes, bitcoin has the power to undermine the banking system and reshape the financial landscape.   Also read: Major Darknet Marketplace Alphabay Goes Down, Exit Scam Speculations Arise In an Amarillo Local News article published yesterday, Bank of Commerce President Alex O’Brien commented on bitcoin. “I’m scared for the banking industry because I think that Bitcoin and Litecoin, the concepts behind them and the way the blockchain works, is something that could knock banks out of the game.” But even though O’Brien is worried about the future of banking, he mentioned he really likes the concept of blockchain-based currencies. Another banker at the Amarillo National Bank does not harbor the same fears. He recognizes the future potential of digital currency, though. Vice president Stewart Dodson of Amarillo Nation Bank said the dark, shady roots of bitcoin will be a deterrent for future adoption. He said bitcoin’s past use to facilitate dark web transactions have tainted the currency’s appeal. Now it will harbor that stigma forever. Even though Dodson sees bitcoin as tainted, he admitted a “digital currency” will eventually be adopted by the mainstream. He mentioned various payment apps like Venmo and Applepay could win the race, even though they are not cryptocurrency-based platforms. Jon Laur, chief technology officer for EnergyNet — an Amarillo-based oil and gas auction and sealed bid transaction service also chimed in on the discussion. He said banks need to get ahead of the game. He mentioned that if banks do not have someone on the payroll who knows more about cryptocurrency than “your average nerd on the street,” they will be left behind. In the final analysis, the bankers concluded digital automation could change the face of the industry. The convenience of digital currencies makes jobs expendable, and could replace some banking roles. The article detailed, “In a region with 6,600 financial sector employees as of 2014, according to the Texas Workforce Commission, lower-level positions could be eliminated or simply not added as banks invest more in Internet services.” Do you think the banks will adopt bitcoin, or are some of these bankers right in believing bitcoin will displace them?  Let us know in the comments below.

According to the agency’s announcement on Wednesday, among the topics discussed this year was the use of cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin as a store of value and as a legitimate payment method. Also read: Rollout of 260,000+ Bitcoin-Accepting Stores in Japan Begins Europol’s European Cybercrime Centre (EC3) recently organized the “4th Virtual Currencies Conference,” hosted at the Europol’s headquarters in The Hague. EC3 was set up in 2013 as the EU’s cybercrime specialist unit to help law enforcement respond to cyber attacks. The event, which took place on June 22 and 23, aimed “to further strengthen the fight against the abuse of virtual currencies for criminal transactions and money laundering.” This was also the same theme of the 3rd Virtual Currencies Conference which took place on July 14-15 last year. However, unlike previous years, Europol has added other discussions to the conference. According to the agency’s announcement on Wednesday: The event was attended by over 150 experts from various fields this year. Many law enforcement authorities in both European countries and non-EU countries returned, but this time experts from the private sector were also invited. Many Bitcoin companies were chosen to attend because they specialize in “facilitating the lawful use of virtual currencies by providing online exchange, payment processing or wallet services.” According to Europol, the industry experts that attended include Bitcoin.de, Bitfinex, Bitpanda, Bitonic, Bitstamp, Bitpay, Coinbase, Cubits, Localbitcoins, Spectrocoin and Xapo. The announcement states that “the participants shared their insights into criminal trends and the latest techniques used by criminals to hide their financial tracks and cash out criminal proceeds using bitcoins and other virtual currencies.” The EU has done significant research regarding digital currency as a store of value. Over time, their researchers found that bitcoin has increasingly gained more acceptance as a store of value. A 2015 European Commission report detailed how bitcoin has two features as a store of value, which differ substantially from traditional currencies. They are “non-inflationary supply and cyber security.” The author wrote, “bitcoin is the protection against inflation as a safe haven from government interference.” However, as a store of value, the report noted that “Bitcoin sensitivity to cyber-attacks and thefts reduces trust in bitcoin as a currency and hence impedes its growth and chances of becoming a global currency.” Meanwhile, The Financial Action Task Force (FATF) has noted that “non-payment uses of virtual currencies may include store-of-value products for savings or investment purposes, such as derivatives, commodities, and securities products.” This view has been referenced by the European Central Bank and other agencies. Then in May this year, the European Parliament’s Directorate-General for Internal Policies report stated that “Once trading of the digital currency in exchange for sovereign currency begins, there will be a positive market price or exchange rate.” In addition, the report detailed “With digital currencies becoming more popular as a medium of exchange and also as a store of value, various asset substitutions take place. Households will reduce their cash holdings as they will start to make some payments with the digital currency.” What do you think the Europol will do about Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-07-05T22:00:34-04:00,The Bitcoin Network’s Hashrate Now Exceeds Six Exahash,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-six-exahash-july-1/,"Last May Bitcoin.com reported on how the Bitcoin network’s hashrate surpassed four exahash per second. Just two months later on July 1st, the hashrate has increased another two exahash which transcended to a high of 6,622,799,000 GH/s according to Blockchain.info and Bitcoin Wisdom statistics. Also Read: Investment Funds That Offer Cryptocurrency Exposure See Big Gains The first week of July is showing the vast power of the Bitcoin network as miners are currently processing transactions at a whopping 5,808,727,020 GH/s. On July 1st miners pushed the hashrate up over six exahash per second reaching it’s highest point ever recorded. The mining ecosystem is far bigger than during the early days, as miners progressed from CPU mining, GPU mining, FPGA Mining, to giant warehouses filled with ASIC miners. Furthermore, there are far more mining pools today, as there are currently 24 known pools taking a portion of the hashrate pie. Things are quite different than the early days when one single bitcoin enthusiast like Artforz captured a significant portion of the network’s hashrate. People also often forget when the mining pool Ghash.io passed the 51 percent mark in 2014, as pools in 2017 are more diversified than ever before. Only three pools command more than ten percent of the hashrate while the other 21 pools process less than ten percent. The two exahash increase over the past month and a half has coincided with bitcoin’s rising fiat value, increased demand and mining revenue at all-time highs. Moreover, mining revenue has increased while the block reward has decreased since 2009’s first fifty BTC reward to 12.5 BTC per block, with the reward expected to continue to halve approximately every four years. In September of 2013, the hash rate had only hit one petahash per second, so the hashrate is expanding significantly yearly. The six exahash record also comes only one year and six months after the network topped one exahash or 1000 petahashes per second. The exponential rate growth will someday surpass the exahash era (exabytes) and could reach zettabytes or even yottabytes per second. This will likely take many years as 500 exabytes is only one-half of a zettabyte. The record-breaking six exahash is another landmark achievement for the Bitcoin network as the innovative protocol has reached many milestones this year. It’s an amazing feat to see such power obtained without a large corporation or government backing. All of the hashrate power is commanded by miners choosing to join the decentralized system voluntarily, all thanks to the economic incentive of the block reward plus transaction fees.

2017-07-05T17:00:54-04:00,Unconfirmed Transactions Queue and Bitcoin Fees Drop Considerably,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/unconfirmed-transactions-bitcoin-fees-drop/,"For about a week and a half, the Bitcoin network’s transaction congestion and rising fee market has subsided. People are now reporting on how they are sending transactions for smaller fees, and some of them are having difficulty with wallets that are recommending fees that are much higher than needed. Also read: The Decentralize Your Life Tour: An Interview With Derrick Broze  The amount of unconfirmed transactions has been significantly lower than usual with the mempool (transaction queue) averaging roughly 7,000 to 15,000 unconfirmed transactions per day. This is a stark contrast to the 200,000+ transactions held up in the mempool just a few weeks prior. The transaction stress started diminishing around the first week of June and has continued to decline to the levels we are at today. Since the number of unconfirmed transactions has dropped and there has been more room for bitcoin transactions — fees have also dropped. Less than two years ago anyone could send some bitcoin for a fee of roughly $0.02 worth of BTC, but this past May fees reached an average median of $5 per transaction. However, fees now have abated to levels under a dollar and some as low as $0.25 according to a few bitcoin proponents. Of course, there are multiple theories detailing how the number of unconfirmed transactions has waned and why the fee market is significantly lower than a few weeks prior. Some believe the issue stemmed from a “spam attack” where an individual or group sends a large amount of low fee transactions relentlessly. However, people believe the cost to keep this attack going is considerable and some proponents believe this theory is merely a conspiracy. Another reason people believe transactions and fees are lower is due to less bitcoin activity. For instance, the price of bitcoin has dropped a few times after reaching all-time highs, and people are not transacting as much. Alongside this, trade volume has weakened as well to less than $1 billion compared to $2 billion USD worth of BTC trades per day. Some have also attributed the prior congestion and higher fees towards the use of darknet mixers. Another theory is that companies like Genesis mining, and other bitcoin businesses are moving/batching more transactions “off-chain” instead of settling as often as previously done. Many of these theories are difficult to verify. Since the fee market and unconfirmed transaction count has lowered, many people have been having issues with wallets that don’t allow custom fees. Some wallets offer three different settings in order for senders to prioritize their transactions, while others offer custom settings. For instance, this morning Breadwallet recommended that a fee of $1.78 for a typical transaction size of 226 bytes. Additionally going over to 21 Inc’s fee converter website, the tool details the “fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 300 satoshis/byte” for a 226-byte transaction which equals $1.73 at press time. Many wallets and fee charts have higher than needed fee recommendations for the time being. There are other wallets that offer custom fees where users can manually lower the setting to under 300 satoshis/byte which will likely confirm just as fast as the higher recommended fee settings. Most wallets utilize a dynamic fee setting which suggests only three choices and are usually based off tools like 21 Inc’s inaccurate chart. However, there are a few wallets that offer custom fees including Blockchain.info, Trezor, Armory, Green Address, Airbitz and more. During these times when congestion is low, users can check the mempool to see if there is a minimal amount of unconfirmed transactions and possibly get away with paying a lower fee. Bitcoin users can opt to pay the economy fee rate within their wallet settings or may even want to switch to wallets that offer customized fee settings. The choice is entirely up to the user, but for now, the Bitcoin network’s congestion is diminished and fees are lower.  What do you think about the number of unconfirmed transactions dropping and the fees being lower? Have you experienced paying cheaper fees for transactions? Let us know about it in the comments below.

The company was founded in 1998, and since 2014 it has been recognized as the largest Russian Forex broker based upon monthly turnover and number of clients. Despite its Russian success, Alpari has seen significant struggles in recent years – following the insolvency of its UK entity and the revocation of the company’s United States National Futures Association and subsequent exit from the US markets. The introduction of bitcoin derivatives trading is of prescient timing for Alpari, following recent announcements that Russia is developing a regulatory framework for bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Many commentators are skeptical that Putin’s Russia will fully embrace bitcoin, as cryptocurrency has the potential to further erode the Russian state’s ability to exercise centralized control over financial circulation.  From the perspective of the Russian state, encouraging bitcoin-based trading could facilitate growth in Russian fintech firms like Alpari – allowing such to cash in on the growth of cryptocurrency without promoting the disruptive potential of free and direct cryptocurrency trading, or risking encouraging direct competitor to the national cryptocurrency that Russia has announced it is developing. Alpari has joined a growing list of international forex and CFD brokers who have recently launched bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading pairs. Israeli-based Panda Trading Systems also announced the introduction of seven cryptocurrency CFD products this week, with Panda’s Ori Hazan stating that Panda is “very pleased to be a part of this exciting new direction the online trading industry is taking. Cryptocurrencies have been on our radar for quite a few years now, but they finally seem to be moving into mainstream adoption and we’re ready for this change.” In recent weeks HYCM has launched bitcoin derivatives trading to UK, Dubai and Cyprus customer, with Ayondo, Etoro, Plus500, and many other CFD brokers also introducing cryptocurrency CFD markets in recent months.

2017-07-04T22:00:13-04:00,Jihan Wu Talks About Obedience to Authority in the Bitcoin Ecosystem,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/jihan-wu-talks-about-obedience-to-authority-in-the-cryptocurrency-space/,"Jihan Wu is a founder of the mining company Bitmain and an influential force in the cryptocurrency space. He spoke on many topics at the Future of Bitcoin conference in Arnhem, Netherlands, which took place June 30 to July 1. The title of his talk was “Why Multiple Implementations are Quite Important for Bitcoin.” Also read: The Decentralize Your Life Tour: An Interview With Derrick Broze One of the most powerful things Wu discussed was the psychology of authority that is surrounding the bitcoin ecosystem. Wu talked about several popular social psychological experiments and how they may play out in the current unfolding drama. He opened, however, by discussing different ways society is organized by governments: aristocracy, monarchy, oligarchy, tyranny, and democracy. He said crypto-project founders could potentially be tyrants or dictators. He said usually founders have contributed the most to a project, though. The founder’s skills are well recognized and he/she knows everyone who contributed…and is almost renowned. But Wu points out this could cause problems and create a platform for dictatorship. He elaborated: Wu said tyranny crops up partly as a result of human nature, and the human tendency to be obedient to authority. He said there is a readiness for human beings to obey others. He defended his point by citing Stanley Milgram‘s Obedience to Authority Experiment. He also said that humans have inbuilt biases, such as the the Halo Effect. This means that if people have a certain quality or impression, then other contributors and people may be more likely to follow them. Lastly, Wu cited the Bandwagon effect. In this psychological effect, people are likely to follow the crowd or follow people merely because they are doing it. He said all of these are social dynamic effects that everyone in the cryptocurrency ecosystem has to be wary of, lest we end up following a ruler in the form of a developer or programmer. Wu even applied his logic to Satoshi Nakamoto, saying he altered the bitcoin code multiple times and no one really questioned the move until Jeff Garzik came along. This is something that has to be watched, even if it is the creator of Bitcoin, Wu implied. In order to solve this problem of protocol tyranny and hijacked implementations, Wu suggested that for the future of bitcoin to remain beautiful and grow, the community will need multiple implementations. Wu said: Wu goes on to mention that Bitcoin has missed many great innovations, including smart contracts and the creation of decentralized exchanges. He mentioned that as a community bitcoin is a little late to the game in regards to innovation. He said the bitcoin ecosystem is also missing economic reward incentives in regards to inflation. The reason why bitcoin has missed these innovations is because some bitcoiners, according to Wu, trash new innovations by always calling them scammy or leveling other judgmental critiques. Wu says getting the community outside of the follower mentality and convincing them to accept the possibility of innovation through multiple implementations will provide the network and ecosystem with the room to grow and thrive. Do you think there is too much obedience to authority in the bitcoin ecosystem? Is it causing innovators and others involved to miss opportunities for multiple implementations? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Shutterstock and Jihan Wu’s Twitter Page Bitcoin is cool, and you know everyone wants in – even the ones who say they don’t.

2017-07-04T17:00:57-04:00,South Korea Sets Up Task Force to Determine if Bitcoin Needs Regulations,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-task-force-bitcoin-regulations/,"Following Rep. Park Yong-jin’s announcement of a proposed bill to provide a legal framework for digital currencies like bitcoin, South Korea has now set up a task force to determine if bitcoin should be regulated. Also read: Rollout of 260,000+ Bitcoin-Accepting Stores in Japan Begins Bitcoin.com recently reported on Rep. Park Yong-jin of the ruling Democratic Party of South Korea preparing a bill that will provide bitcoin, ethereum, and other digital currencies with a legal framework. Following lawmaker Park’s efforts towards digital currency legislation, Business Korea reported that the South Korean Financial Supervisory Commission is taking a prudent approach. According to an official of the Commission: South Korea is not the only country to set up a task force to evaluate if bitcoin should be regulated, nor is it the only country looking to others for examples. Recently, India announced that it would set up a task force to come up with recommendations regarding bitcoin regulations, which are expected in 6 months. In Southeast Asia, the Deputy Prime Minister of Thailand has also ordered the country’s central bank to study bitcoin and learn from other countries as well. In addition, he proposed creating a dedicated fintech unit that can explore the opportunities presented by bitcoin. While several countries are still evaluating whether to regulate bitcoin, the Korean Financial Supervisory Commission noted that Japan stands out as having already revised its laws to recognize and regulate the cryptocurrency. Domestic bitcoin exchanges in South Korea such as Bithumb, Korbit, Coinone and Coinplug are not subject to regulations and oversight by financial authorities, unlike other financial institutions in the country. However, large-scale transactions are being made through them. Lawmaker Park pointed out that currently these exchanges “receive about 6.5 billion won (US$5.8 million) a day by 0.5% of transaction money as a commission,” even though they were established without any license from financial authorities. Business Korea then quoted him saying: Currently, all these exchanges are “registered and operating as a ‘telecom vendor’ that can be opened for business immediately after they report it,” Kinews detailed. The lack of relevant laws has led each bitcoin exchange to set up their own security regulations, explained a domestic cryptocurrency exchange, Coinone. “Compared to financial institutions like banks, it is true that these are not enough,” the publication quoted the exchange saying. “For Coinone, we are building an enhanced security system that includes not only our own security management but also consulting services from security experts.” In addition, the media outlet quoted an official of the South Korean Financial Supervisory Service saying, “legal guidelines are essential for insurance to compensate for the damage caused by virtual currency.” Do you think South Korea will follow Japan’s footstep and legalize bitcoin?

Immediately, a chain of 334 eyeglasses stores using the app announced that it will accept the cryptocurrency starting July 10. Also read: Bitcoin to Be Accepted at 260,000 Stores in Japan by This Summer Bitcoin.com reported in April about Recruit Lifestyle Co., Ltd. partnering with Japanese bitcoin exchange Coincheck for its point-of-sale (POS) app called “Mobile Payment for Air Regi” to accept bitcoin payments. On Monday, almost three months later, Recruit Lifestyle finally announced that the Air Regi app now offers a bitcoin payment option starting on July 3. The announcement came two days after the law that removes the 8% consumption tax on bitcoin went into effect in Japan. Currently, about 260,000 commercial facilities, food establishments, drugstores and other retail locations nationwide use this tablet-based POS system. Coincheck said in April that by this summer, bitcoin will become a payment option at all of these shops that use this proprietary app. The exchange explained: On Monday, a chain of eyeglasses stores with 334 locations across Japan also announced that all of its stores will start accepting bitcoin beginning July 10. The chain is called Megane Super and it uses the Air Regi app. The company expects its user base to increase, especially from Europe and the U.S., since the new form of payment will improve convenience, Kabutan reported. In addition, it believes adding the bitcoin payment option will attract tourists to the stores which already accept Alipay and Line Pay through Air Regi. Kagayaki Kawabata, Coincheck International Business Developer, confirmed to Bitcoin.com that the eyeglasses stores are the first of the 260,000+ stores that will start accepting bitcoin using the Air Regi app. He added: In addition to working with Recruit Lifestyle, Coincheck has also been busy signing up merchants to accept bitcoin directly. Recent additions to the exchange’s list of 5000+ bitcoin-accepting stores include popular capsule hotels, a property management company in Akihabara, and Kai Corporation which owns five unique restaurants in Japan.

2017-07-03T14:13:32-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin Bulls Are Back Testing Key Resistance Levels,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoin-bulls-testing-resistance/,"After a few days of consolidation, the price of bitcoin has started to move upwards after dropping to a low of $2290 USD per BTC earlier this week. On July 2-3 bitcoin’s value rose above the $2500 range and recently tested a high of $2595 on Bitstamp, this morning at 10 am EDT time. Also Read: Scheduled Scaling Updates for the Bitcoin Network Are Getting Closer Our last markets update on June 25 was the start of a significantly longer than usual BTC bear market dropping below the sub $2300 territory. Since then the price rebounded back above the $2400 range and formed some consolidation and a triangular formation. A week later on July 3rd bitcoin is showing some bullish momentum as it tried to break the $2600 zone. Currently, the price per BTC is holding a weighted average of $2560 across global exchanges, with approximately a billion dollar’s worth of 24-hour trade volume. Since bitcoin’s price downturn last week nearly every other cryptocurrency market followed its path. At the moment overall cryptocurrency market capitalizations are just above $100 billion but it dipped lower than that earlier this week. Out of all the crypto-caps, bitcoin is commanding a 41 percent market dominance, which is considerably higher than weeks prior. Asian bitcoin markets are still trading BTC at premium prices throughout a few exchanges, such as South Korea’s Korbit, and China’s BTCC with prices $50-100 higher at the moment. While looking at the daily chart and the one-week chart bitcoin is showing bullish signs of continuing its move upwards. However, according to a few technical indicators, a seller’s market is still happening, and there will be some upside resistance over the next 12-hours. For instance, the gap between the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is lower than the longer term 200 SMA showing there’s still some heavier sell walls to break. Stochastic and RSI trend lines reveal similar overbought conditions ahead. However, the past few days consolidation has created a nice butterfly pattern or symmetrical triangle and many traders on Trading View, Whale Pool, and other trading forums are betting “long” on the upside of $2900 or higher. Overall market sentiment has still been bearish due to the uncertain future of the bitcoin network’s possible changes. There are a few scaling plans down the road this summer, but some of them don’t align well with the “community consensus”, depending on what side of the debate you are on. Currently, there are multiple new bitcoin implementations being tested and the possibility of Segwit2x, a user activated soft fork (UASF), and a user activated hard fork (UAHF) being deployed. Moreover, Craig Wright is back and has revealed his opinion about the state of the network during The Future of Bitcoin conference this past weekend in Arnhem. This particular topic has also sparked a massive debate between members of the bitcoin ‘community.’   On the flipside, countries like South Korea and India may be creating bitcoin regulation in the near future. Much like Japan, these areas may legitimize the currency legally as a form of payment, and many believe these decisions will push the price up. Japan has recently removed its consumption tax from bitcoin sales and purchases. At the same time, Australia stopped bitcoin double taxation in the country as well on July 1st. Bear Scenario: At the moment there is heavy resistance for bitcoin’s price to break above the $2575 territory, but at the moment buyers are chipping away at those walls as we speak. If a downward break happens again, there is a foundation of $2400-2450 at the moment and swings should not go lower than that unless panic takes hold. Currently, buyers seem to be regaining control and bears will likely have to wait for larger breaks and bigger legs down.   Bull Scenario: Currently, bulls have left the sidelines and are back in the game after finding better positions during last week’s lows. Bitcoin’s price needs to break key resistance points above the $2600 range to get velocity moving faster. Surpassing the previous month’s all-time high this July at $2600 may be possible, but as the network’s proposed scaling updates get closer BTC markets may get choppy.   What do you think about the price moving back up the ladder? Do you think the price will come close to $3K again? Or do you think the upcoming uncertainty will keep the price down? Let us know in the comments below.

Also read: Revised Tax in Effect From Today In Japan, Giving Residents ‘Access to Global Markets’ The Thai Deputy Prime Minister Somkid Jatusripitak recently ordered the Bank of Thailand (BOT) to study if bitcoin is suitable as a legal method of payment in the country, according to several local newspapers. At the fintech event organized by the Matichon Group last month, he said the Ministry of Finance and the BOT must collaborate to support fintech, adding that (loosely translated): “The BOT already knows what rules and regulations should be amended,” the deputy prime minister said. “Not everything is prohibited. Whatever is too much is not good, whatever is too little is also not good,” he argued. While admitting Thailand cannot compete with financial centers such as Singapore, he hopes it could be a fintech leader among neighbors including Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam. In response to the Deputy Prime Minister’s order, the BOT governor, Veerathai Santiprabhob, said that there are many factors to consider in studying bitcoin. The bank will also determine if it could be used to pay off debts legally, according to the Nation TV. The BOT governor reiterated that the bank has not adopted bitcoin as a legal currency or a method of payment like Japan has. He also noted concerns over its volatility as well as the lack of public understanding on the subject. The bank needs to carefully examine the development of bitcoin further to determine how useful it is, and weigh between its benefits and risks, he detailed. The Thai Minister of Finance, Apisak Tantivorawong, believes that the BOT will be able to amend its rules appropriately, according to Khao Sod. He additionally suggested that Thailand should learn from other countries in determining if bitcoin is suitable for the Thai regulatory environment, taking into account the factors encountered by countries that use and do not use digital currencies. He suggested exploring how much to restrict and control bitcoin’s usage as well as how to prevent fraud and ponzi schemes, noting that these issues are all considered new in Thailand and must first be clearly defined.

2017-07-03T04:00:30-04:00,Bitwage Officially Launches UK Bitcoin Payroll Services,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitwage-launches-uk-bitcoin-payroll-services/,"After expanding services in Europe earlier this year, bitcoin payroll and wage payment service provider Bitwage announced its official launch in the UK on Monday. Also read: Bitwage Launches New Functionality for European Customers Bitwage offers solutions for remote workers to receive wages in a variety of currencies including bitcoin. Using the service, workers can get paid in bitcoin without having to ask each employer to pay in the cryptocurrency or sign up with Bitwage. They simply give the employers Bitwage’s bank account details to receive payments in. Bitwage claims to have over 13,000 registered workers and have processed over $21.6 million in international wages. Users can invoice employers or clients in the United States (US), United Kingdom (UK), and the European Union (EU). Wages received can be split into any ratio between different bank accounts and bitcoin wallets. On Monday, the company announced the official launch of their services in the UK, stating: Bitwage founder and president Jonathan Chester told Bitcoin.com that the company has been beta testing this service. He explained that although the ability to receive wages in British pounds (GBP) existed previously, it was not done locally and was never publicly launched. Without local UK partners, the service was not cost-effective. Chester detailed: Chaps is the UK’s same-day high-value payment system, currently used by 26 direct participants including the Bank of England and over 5,000 indirect participants. Payments are transferred over Swift and settled intraday in central bank funds. In 2016 Chap’s volumes reached a record 39 million transactions, worth £75.6 trillion. Bacs is responsible for the clearing and settlement of UK automated payment methods, direct debit and Bacs direct credit. The company processed 6.22 billion transactions to UK bank accounts in 2016, worth £4.8 trillion. Faster Payments is a UK banking initiative which uses the Bacs system to reduce payment times between different banks’ customer accounts from three working days to a few hours. While Chaps focuses on same-day service for high-value transactions, Faster Payments is tailored to the much larger number of smaller payments. In April, Bitcoin.com reported on Bitwage launching unique IBANs for users receiving wages in the European Union. With Monday’s launch in the UK, employers can pay in US dollars, British pounds, and euros. In addition, Bitwage can accept Canadian dollars, Australian dollars, Swiss Francs, and Japanese yen. Payouts to the workers are far more diverse and are done on the same or next day. Currencies supported include bitcoin, ether, and litecoin, as well as the US dollar, the euro, the British pound, the Brazilian Real, the Philippine peso, the Mexican peso, the Argentine peso, the Indian rupee, the Vietnamese dong, the Nigerian naira, and the Ukrainian hryvnia.

According to reports, there is a nationwide shortage of graphics processing units (GPU:s) due to Thailand residents mining digital assets like Ethereum and Zcash to trade for BTC. Veerachai Morprapaipan, the store owner who helped organize the expo at the Queen Sirikit Convention Center said there were so many people he lost track of how many customers attended.Â  One customer, Niratcha Sukyu states âIâm buying as many pieces as I can get my hands on.â The GPU vendor from Thailand details that many altcoins have increased in value and local miners are trading them for bitcoin.

One of bitcoin’s great use cases, which is on the rise, is how easy it is to donate to charitable funds. According to a recent Fidelity Charitable 2017 Giving Report donations to Fidelity Charitable made in bitcoin is growing significantly. Also read: Leading Japanese ATM Manufacturer Oki Gets into Bitcoin ATM Business Just recently Bitcoin.com reported on the CEO of Fidelity Investments, Ms. Abigail Johnson telling the public how much the company liked bitcoin.

Now the company has published it’s annual Fidelity Charitable 2017 Giving Report which details how charitable donations made in bitcoin is on the rise. Fidelity’s 26-page report details that a lot of people are donating with non-publicly traded assets and a very popular contribution method is bitcoin. In the first six months of 2017 Fidelity Charitable received $9 million in BTC so far and that number has already surpassed 2016’s bitcoin donations by $2 million. The organization has turned over $3.1 billion in non-publicly traded assets like real estate, life insurance policies and even grain. The digital asset bitcoin has been used for Fidelity’s philanthropic funds and grants since 2015. Another good example of bitcoin being used for charity is how Chinese investors are using the cryptocurrency to donate to victims of the recent Sichuan province landslide that devastated the local community. On June 24 a landslide in south-western China in the Mao County region destroyed over 40 homes alongside reports of numerous deaths and people missing. According to the regional publication 8BTC a variety of cryptocurrency community members are donating bitcoins to Sichuan landslide victims.

2017-06-30T19:00:31-04:00,The Curious Dilemma of the Bitcoin ‘Community’ Going Separate Ways,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/curious-dilemma-bitcoin-community-separate-ways/,"The scaling discussion has been a long and exhausting debate that has been going on for many years. Currently, there are a couple of proposals like UASF and Segwit2x that may be coming to the Bitcoin network in the near future. However, as many people are calling Segwit2x the last chance for the Bitcoin ‘community’ to come to a consensus together, many people are starting to believe a divorce would be the better route. Also read: The Japanese are Using Bitcoin More than Expected Individuals and groups involved with the bitcoin economy have been fighting incessantly about the best methods to scale the network. There is a clear division among two camps we call “small blockers and big blockers” and two distinct and competing Reddit debate forums (r/bitcoin and r/btc) as well. Over the past six months, the infighting has increased exponentially and often times left a salty aftertaste after nearly every bitcoin-related conversation.  Over the past few months and with the new Segwit2x compromise taking place, I personally have felt pretty optimistic that there won’t be a blockchain split. However, from talking with many people in the industry and reading various opinions throughout social media, I’ve started to realize that a divorce may be the best path forward for the bitcoin community. The thought scares me and often makes me cringe, but it’s due to the great memories I’ve had with the old community before 2015. A recent blog post written by the eloquent writer John Blocke has also confirmed to me that many others believe the bitcoin ‘community’ should go their separate ways. “Like an appendectomy, a chain split may be uncomfortable, perhaps painful, and will almost certainly create short-term confusion while the markets work on valuing the respective tokens,” explains Blocke’s post called ‘Bring on the Chain Split.’ “But when one’s appendix ruptures, you don’t pop a few high-strength painkillers and call it a day, you treat the problem at its source.” The author with very strong opinions is not the only one who feels this way. While visiting the top Bitcoin-related Reddit forums r/btc and r/bitcoin the sentiment of compromise in threads and discussions are far and few between. On r/btc many believe Segwit is poison and they want nothing to do with the protocol. At r/bitcoin the same is said about a hard fork, and many are shouting UASF with pitchforks calling miners “terrorists” and vowing to dismiss compromising on raising the block size limit. Bitcoin software developers are also fighting back and forth over Reddit forums and Twitter. Even though there is a large majority of the network hashrate signaling support for a compromise, most of the vocal core development team has shown they vehemently oppose Segwit2x at the moment. Alongside this, there are many teams that aim to go beyond the core developer’s protocol by building alternative bitcoin client implementations of their own.  Sadly enough it doesn’t seem like the infighting will end anytime soon and even if an agreement happens, there will likely be more severe disagreements in the future. A divorce may be the best path forward as the two sides of the debate can finally go their separate ways. The question of which bitcoin will hold the network affect, branding and majority of users will ultimately be decided by the market. If we all do decide to split up, the market price will likely fracture into two unequally valued tokens and the fight about who is “Bitcoin” might be worse than what we are dealing with today.  It really does sadden me that things may end up this way as divorce often feels like a death, but in time individuals, communities and yes even the Bitcoin network will grow stronger no matter what happens. I still love bitcoin, and a compromise could very well happen, but if we split, I think we will all heal just fine from the wounds of the past. I still also believe there are strong incentives for bitcoin enthusiasts to stay together and Segwit2x could very well pull off a compromise. It’ll likely be short term but as a community with a finite lifespan, compared to a protocol that can run for infinity — We could ‘maybe’ work out our community problems for the time being. John and Paul made some good albums, but there was nothing like the fabulous four.   “Life is very short, and there’s no time for fussing and fighting, my friend, I have always thought that it’s a crime, So I will ask you once again… Try to see it my way, only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong. Why you see it your way there’s a chance that we may fall apart before too long.” ~ The Beatles What do you think about the current state of the Bitcoin ‘community?’ Do you think the entire community can reconcile and come to consensus as a whole?

He pleaded guilty to money laundering charges and charges of fraud. Richo was originally arrested on October 5, 2016, in connection with the crimes. In the scheme, Richo stole user logon credentials and siphoned bitcoin from multiple dark web accounts. The amount was estimated to be worth about $365,000 in bitcoin.  Also read: Asus and Nvidia Announce Purpose-Built Cryptocurrency Mining GPUs Richo conducted the scheme via the tor network, and created fraudulent business pages similar to known ones, where he would incite victims to sign up to those pages with a name and password. Then he would lay in wait until users logged in so he could steal their credentials. He would slyly watch accounts for newly deposited bitcoin. Once the unsuspecting victims deposited some amount, he would drain it into his own account. The Connecticut court documents detailed what he did with the stolen bitcoin: “If the individual later also deposited bitcoins with the real marketplace, Richo withdrew the bitcoins before the individual could spend them and caused the stolen bitcoins to be deposited into his own bitcoin wallet. Richo then sold the stolen bitcoins to others in exchange for U.S. currency, which was deposited into bank accounts that Richo controlled or was provided to him through Green Dot Cards, Western Union transfers, and MoneyGram transfers.” In the end, Richo pleaded guilty to one count of access device fraud and one count of money laundering. According to the court affiliated page, the fraud charge carries a minimum sentence of 10 years, and the money laundering charge carries a minimum of 20 years in prison. Documents stated Richo obtained more than 10,000 user credentials during the time of the phishing operation. However, this type of phishing scheme does not only target users on the dark web to steal their bitcoin. Clearnet users also have to be wary of phishing schemes. For instance, a recent article from Cisco Umbrella declared bitcoin wallet providers and other services are now the focal point of many fraud-based schemes. The article mentioned Kraken and Paxful users have already been targeted. Paxful even has a fidelity warning message to signal users that they are on the correct page. Luckily, most nefarious domains are suspended when the host realizes no name is registered or they receive complaints of phishing. According to Cisco Umbrella, growth in these phishing schemes have risen in lockstep with the growth of bitcoin. The website even provided a pdf file with information regarding current phishing domains, which users should be aware of lest they have their bitcoin pick-pocketed. The Cisco blog explained, Have you ever been the victim of a phishing attack geared to steal your bitcoin? Share your thoughts below!

Also read: Bitpoint Adds Bitcoin and Ether Payments to Platform with Unionpay, Wechat Pay and Alipay Two of Japan’s leading bitcoin exchanges, Bitflyer and Coincheck, are partnering with large Japanese insurance companies to offer merchants insurance to protect them from Bitcoin transactions that do not go through correctly, Nikkei reported. “Policies will cover losses from botched payments,” the publication described, adding that: Since the Japanese government started recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment on April 1, a growing number of merchants have started adopting the digital currency. Recently, Bitcoin.com reported on businesses in Japan’s number one electronics shopping district, Akihabara, accepting bitcoin. Both Coincheck and Bitflyer have continually been signing up retailers across Japan to start accepting bitcoin, such as Bic Camera and some popular capsule hotels. The Tokyo-based Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance Group (MSIG) is part of the MS&AD Insurance Holdings Group. Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bitflyer, has announced that it has partnered with the insurance company to offer merchants a way to receive compensation for failed Bitcoin transactions, Nikkei detailed, adding that: This insurance “will cover damages if a customer payment does not go through correctly due to system problems or other issues,” the publication noted. This is not the first time Bitflyer has worked with MSIG. In November 2016, the two companies started co-developing “Japan’s first cyber insurance policy for Bitcoin businesses,” they announced at the time. The two “have collaboratively created a special insurance package with comprehensive compensation for Bitcoin businesses for risks associated with cyber attacks,” they described. The policy covers a wide range of damages incurred from the theft and disappearance of bitcoin following cyber attacks, as well as other support services. “The total coverage, ranging from 10 million yen ($89,000) to 1 billion yen, will be offered against damages and losses caused by cyber attacks and other unauthorized accesses, as well as mistakes and impropriety by employees,” Nikkei reported at the time. Another leading Japanese bitcoin exchange, Coincheck, is also preparing to offer a similar insurance product by teaming up with Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance, a property and casualty insurance subsidiary of Tokio Marine Holdings, according to Nikkei. Earlier this month, Coincheck announced a different insurance product through the same Tokio Marine & Nichido Fire Insurance company. This insurance would compensate Coincheck users up to 1 million yen in case of “unauthorized login to user account.” The exchange said that this type of coverage is the first of its kind in Japan. “We will indemnify damage incurred by unauthorized login to a user account that has set up 2-step authentication on the virtual currency exchange ‘Coincheck’ that we operate,” the exchange announced at the time, adding that “we will pay up to 1 million yen as compensation amount per request.” A few different types of insurance covering Bitcoin transactions already exist. However, they are third-party services, and not offered by the exchanges providing merchant processing solutions. Often, merchants are not aware of these services at the time they sign up to start accepting bitcoin. GAP600, for example, is a US-based insurance underwriter used by Shapeshift, Cubits and Coinify. Founded in 2015, the company underwrites Bitcoin transactions for merchants, developers and service providers to allow zero-confirmation transactions, according to its website. GAP600 describes its product as an insurance service that “bridges the time gap from the published transaction on the Bitcoin network to the moment it joins the blockchain, by immediately confirming Bitcoin transactions even before they reach the block chain and are included in a mined block.” Blockcypher offers another type of insurance for zero-confirmation bitcoin payments, which the company bundles with its confidence factor scoring system. Although their affordable API-driven service can help merchants decide in real-time if transactions are risky, the added insurance only covers payments up to $9 in value.

2017-06-30T03:00:21-04:00,Asia-Focused Luxury Travel Agency Smiling Albino to Start Accepting Bitcoin,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/smiling-albino-destination-management-company-accepts-bitcoin-for-luxury-travels-in-southeast-asia/,"The Southeast Asian travel agency, Smiling Albino, announced they would begin accepting bitcoin for payment on August 1. The company is based out of Bangkok, Thailand. They work with clients to provide specialized and tailored traveling throughout Southeast Asia. They will accept bitcoin transactions for organizing customized travels in Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos and Myanmar. The destination management company has been providing these luxury travel services for about 15 years.  Also read: Felt Boot Restaurant Valenok Becomes the First in Moscow to Accept Bitcoin Smiling Albino accepts bitcoin from clients directly in a peer-to-peer fashion, although they want clients to use non-exchange-based wallets. They do this so their client’s funds do not have a chance of getting lost and are broadcast immediately on the network.  The company mentioned the reason why they started accepting bitcoin in a press release. They say they have a sophisticated and tech savvy clientele and that their clients are the movers and shakers of their industries, so they need payment methods that match their station in life. Smiling Albino’s Director of Business Development Stephanie Rowe summed up this position. She said, “Our core clients are leaders in their fields and innovators. By adapting early to cryptocurrency we hope to facilitate, for some of our clients, easy payments for on-the-fly bookings or add-ons during their trips. Staying ahead in financial transactions is just one of the many ways we show we’re leading the way in luxury travel”. Overall, Smiling Albino suggested they are accepting bitcoin because it is a more efficient way to book travels. Their customers are paying overseas and this reduces unseen costs and unnecessary overhead for their clients.  Since Japan accepted bitcoin as a national currency, many companies have joined in on the bitcoin mania. It is no surprise that many of these companies hail from Asia and other eastern parts of the globe. For instance, in order to wet the appetite of bitcoin users, Japanese bitcoin exchange Bitpoint recently partnered with Nippon Pay to bring bitcoin as a reliable payment method to many users. Nippon Pay is a multi-payment platform that specializes in expediting mobile payments. They leverage Wechat Pay, Alipay, and Unionpay as part of their service. This greatly expands the influence of bitcoin across Japan and other parts of Asia. Payment additions for South Korea, Thailand, and Taiwan are also being implemented.

2017-06-29T22:00:08-04:00,Valenok Becomes First Restaurant in Moscow to Accept Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/restaurant-valenok-first-moscow-accept-bitcoin/,"A large dining establishment in the center of Moscow reportedly became the first restaurant to accept bitcoin payments in Russia’s capital city on Tuesday, according to local media outlets. Valenok is part of the Novikov Group, which owns over 50 restaurants and franchises. Now the company is considering installing bitcoin ATMs as well. Also read: Bitpoint Adds Bitcoin and Ether Payments to Platform with Unionpay, Wechat Pay, and Alipay On Tuesday, several Russian news outlets reported that Valenok has become the first restaurant in Moscow to accept bitcoin. Named after the traditional Russian type of footwear, Valenok is symbolized by the world’s largest handmade felt boot, its website details. “A symbol of the restaurant is a giant six-meter felt boot (Valenok).” The Russian cuisine restaurant is located on the Tsvetnoy Boulevard in the center of Moscow. The spacious establishment occupies 2 floors, seats 340 people, and an average main course there costs about $10. Valenok is part of the Novikov Group which owns over 50 eatery projects, including restaurants and several franchises, located in Russia, London, and Dubai. Mikhail Petuhov, managing partner at Novikov Group, told BFM.ru that his customers are young, modern and sophisticated. He described the time he was asked by a friend why his restaurant did not accept bitcoin so he decided to try it out. Two transactions were made, which was exciting, the publication reported him saying. “In the restaurant business, I had not heard of such examples. So, there is no one to ask, unfortunately,” he added. Petuhov explained how bitcoin payments work at his restaurant: “The seller generates a QR-code that contains the amount to be paid and the seller’s wallet address. The buyer scans this code using his Bitcoin smartphone app and makes the transaction.” Citing that the restaurant will closely monitor the demand for bitcoin services, he added that the group is also considering installing bitcoin ATMs “to assist the clients wishing to make payments using the cryptocurrency,” RT reported. Petuhov told Russia’s international news agency RIA Novosti: Soon after Valenok’s news, Burger King Russia independently announced its plan to accept the digital currency this year, with the possibility of rolling out the option to more restaurants. The fast food chain has begun looking for a software developer to allow users to pay with bitcoin using both Android and iOS applications. The Novikov Group, founded by entrepreneur restaurateur, Arkady Anatolievich Novikov, owns more than 50 successful conceptual restaurant projects in Russian cities of Moscow, St. Petersburg, Sochi, and Kislovodsk as well as in London and Dubai, its website details. The projects that the group is involved in include several franchises with multiple locations as well. For example, Krispy Kreme is counted as one project but the company owns over 20 locations. In September 2013, the group partnered with Krispy Kreme Doughnut Corporation to build 40 Krispy Kreme stores in Moscow. In addition, the group also runs other types of projects such as Novikov TV, a network of flower studios, a health food company, a greenhouse farm, a charity foundation, a kids club, and a catering business. Digital currencies including bitcoin are still not recognized by the central bank of Russia, and the legal status of bitcoin has not yet been clarified. However, State Duma committee member Vadim Dengin told RIA Novosti on Wednesday that draft laws concerning digital currencies could appear soon. “We will hold roundtable discussions and parliamentary hearings on digital currencies, particularly bitcoin,” he said, adding that there is no need to legalize digital currencies right now. Meanwhile, the head of the State Duma Committee on Economic Policy, Sergei Zhigarev, separately told the publication that the restaurant’s case “demonstrates that life now includes digital currency, and that it has to be taken into account, including in the state calculation.” He then added (loosely translated): Do you think the rest of Novikov Group restaurants will start accepting bitcoin soon?

2017-06-29T19:00:53-04:00,Midwest Peace and Liberty Fest: Intimate Fireside Bitcoin Conversations,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/midwest-peace-and-liberty-fest-intimate-fireside-bitcoin-conversations/,"On June 22 to 26, many anarchists and freedom families congregated in Delton, Michigan for the Midwest Peace and Liberty Fest 5. It is a gathering for all liberty lovers who are looking to network, connect, mingle, and spend some time in nature. Bitcoin.com was lucky enough to make an appearance at the festival and provide attendees with cryptocurrency information and plenty of swag.   Also read: Surveys Suggest Bitcoin Still Has Enormous Growth Potential The mood of the fest was light and intimate. The festival grounds were lush and serene. They included a wooded area with an orchard, plenty of camping spots, and wildlife galore. The atmosphere seemed to encourage bonding between everyone involved. Most of the revelers were there to share their love of liberty, decentralization, and compassion. The fest’s website described it in a similar fashion: “You can expect diverse and life-enriching experiences at this year’s Fest. We know how valuable free time, sharing meals, conversation, and connection with a like-minded community is, and with that in mind we’ve made sure to maintain the laid back and flexible nature of last year’s festival. We are also aware that there is value in highlighting the innovative and intelligent minds the liberty community has to offer from across the Midwest. At the pavilion, expect a line-up of Midwest sourced liberty enthusiasts offering talks, interactive discussions, demonstrations, and dialogues on the most pertinent issues relevant to your freedom.” This year’s talks were no exception regarding the quality of speakers. Several of the greatest minds in the liberty movement provided talks. Some of the subjects included peaceful parenting, government overreach, dealing with police, and slashing healthcare costs. Speakers included Dayna Martin, Jeffery Tucker, Mary Ruwart, Adam Williams, Nick Hazelton, Paul Gordon, Andrew Marich, Shane Radliff, Jeff Wood, and others.  One of the most pertinent cryptocurrency events at the festival was an impromptu bitcoin discussion panel that cropped up as the stars grew bright in the sky and the campfire crackled. The discussion revolved around how to successfully resolve the scaling dilemma. Critiques on Blockstream and Core came up. There were also people who did not know much about bitcoin, so the fireside discussion offered a teachable moment for those individuals. Overall, the discussion was polite. It was also intimate and allowed for many details of each thought to be fleshed out. Jeffery Tucker also referenced the importance of the blockchain revolution and the growing number of cryptocurrency millionaires in his talk. He called the emergence of these new wealthy crypto elite the new “blockchain aristocracy,” because they will be replacing the old order. He implied bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the technologies of liberty, and they are here to stay. He said this is a beautiful time to be alive.  The talks were truly amazing…but the vibe of the festival inspired appreciation and love all on its own. Everywhere people were enjoying themselves and living as freely as possible. They chatted, hugged, and dined in tents or in the cabins. They danced under the moon at the festival’s ‘Anarchy Ball’ on Saturday night. There were also vendors selling all types of merchandise, including food, Kratom, books, trinkets, and other goodies. The cool thing was most of the vendors accepted bitcoin. It is true the internet was a bit sketchy in some parts of the campground, but everyone was willing to cooperate even when technology was not. The festival was amazing and rife with freedom. Anyone interested in decentralization and cryptocurrency should consider going to the fest if they have never attended. It promises a joyous experience for anyone who embraces the nascent future of anarchy. Would you be willing to venture out to Michigan for the Midwest Peace and Liberty Festival?

However, there is another taboo industry that uses bitcoin more profoundly than we can imagine — The pornography business has been embracing bitcoin for quite some time and continues to adopt the digital asset for payments at an exponential rate. Also read: The Backpage Effect: Why the Sex Industry Thrives on Bitcoin The global porn industry is a multi-billion dollar operation that continues to grow bigger every single year. Although the discussion of porn and bitcoin may be unfavorable to certain cryptocurrency proponents, the decentralized currency is used quite a bit within the adult industry. In 2017 there is a vast array of online porn sites that accept bitcoin for payments such as Amateur Canada, Hustler, alongside giant sized adult service providers such as Xhamster, Porn.com, Naughty America, and more. For instance, the well-known porn site ‘Xhamster’ has been accepting bitcoin for a few years now. According to an interview with Xhamster’s Project Manager when they first started adopted bitcoin, the cryptocurrency offered different attributes than traditional payment providers.     In addition to the big porn sites, there are smaller numerous ‘Camgirl’ websites that accept bitcoin as well. Camgirls [and guys] display private performances for online viewers after members pay a certain fee. Websites that offer camera-style and live nude video feeds include Live Jasmin, Flirt 4 Free, and Chaturbate. Furthermore, there are also ‘bitcoin only’ adult websites that offer live shows as well, such as the forum Girls Gone Bitcoin, Strip 4 Bit, and Xotika.tv’s private adult section.  Another porn site Bacchusent Entertainment offers high-quality adult pictures and video at a discount for members who pay with bitcoin. Saffron and Dennis Bacchus have detailed that Bitcoin gives customers the benefit of remaining pseudonymous and allows the company to stay clear of financial blockades issued by credit card companies. The infamous adult magazine company Playboy’s website ‘Playboy Plus’ accepts bitcoin too through the payment processor Bitpay. Users can purchase all three of the company’s membership plans utilizing the decentralized currency. The site offers users access to over 100,000 photos and HD videos for members. Over the past two years, more and more adult websites and online pornography dealers have been adopting bitcoin. It may not be the most favorable topic, but the two economies are thriving together. Bitcoin has enabled porn businesses and their customers the ability to jump over privacy invasive hurdles and censorship from traditional payment processors. Because of these attributes, the decentralized cryptocurrency has attracted a large swathe of porn sites that are utilizing bitcoin for these benefits.

Now according to local reports, Indiaâs Finance Minister Arun Jaitley held a private inter-ministerial meeting to discuss risks and concerns related to bitcoin regulation. Also read:Â Indian Bitcoin Adoption Responds to Government Signalling for Regulation Many bitcoin proponents are focused on India as they believe the country will be the next in line to recognize and regulate the decentralized currency much like Japan. There have been several meetings and discussions with lawmakers like Parliament member Kirit Somaiya, Finance MinisterÂ Arun Jaitley, and many other figureheads.Â  Kirit Somaiya has made some negative comments about bitcoin over Twitter in the past, but has recently listened to citizen feedback about regulating the cryptocurrency. This past March, Indian citizens were recently allowed to comment and send feedback on government bitcoin regulation to various politicians. âI have taken up the issue of bitcoin at various levels, you may send your suggestions to me please,â explains Parliament member Kirit Somaiya this past spring via Twitter.  Now according to sources familiar with Indian government officials, the Finance Minister Jaitleyâs inter-ministerial meeting discussed bitcoin regulation after hearing the public’s opinion. Attendees of the meeting included Economic Affairs Secretary Tapan Ray, IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad, NITI Aayog Vice Chairman Arvind Panagariya, Home Secretary Rajiv Mehrishi, Financial Services Secretary Anjuly Chib Duggal, and a variety of other Indian lawmakers. Although Indian bureaucrats like Kirit Somaiya are skeptical of bitcoin, Jaitley has asked fellow lawmakers and citizens in the past to embrace the digital age and prepare for a cashless âmission modeâ after last November’s demonetization. âSome of the banks have already had a lot of success, contrary to the argument which is made within the political system that Indians are not well adapted to this mode,â Jaitley said at the time. Regulating virtual currencies in India has brought a lot of attention to the countryâs official stance on bitcoin. This past April, legislators created a committee dedicated to researching the various risks and benefits in regards to India legally recognizing the cryptocurrency. On June 20 Bitcoin.com reported on a local Indian CNBC broadcast thatÂ statedÂ most of the committee members said they were in favor of regulatory guidelines for virtual currencies. It seems from Indian news outlets, and regional publication headlines, the Finance Ministry, Jaitley, and the Interdisciplinary Committee will be revealing the outcome of bitcoin regulation soon. Sources say no official decisions were made at Jaitleyâs private event but âseveral issues concerning bitcoinÂ were discussed.â What do you think about Arun Jaitleyâs private bitcoin discussion with fellow Indian bureaucrats?

Also read: Japan’s Largest Online Travel Agent Bringing Bitcoin to 1400+ Hotels This Summer Bitpoint informed their customers on Wednesday that the company has “agreed to form a business tie-up on the deployment of virtual currency settlement services” with multi-payment service Nippon Pay. With this partnership, China’s three major payment services, Wechat Pay, Alipay, and Unionpay will be joined by bitcoin and ether payment options on the new platform. Bitpoint wrote: Bitpoint is calling this service “the world’s first,” because it is the first time Bitcoin and Ethereum will be offered alongside China’s most popular payment services. The company also claims that this is the first time ether will be offered as a payment option in Japan. In an interview with Payment News, the president of Nippon Pay further made the claim that his service is the first in Japan to offer Wechat Pay and Alipay all in one application.  The Tokyo-based Nippon Pay offers payment solutions for businesses with a focus on Chinese mobile payments. “In addition to face-to-face mobile payment at physical stores, we also offer a multi-payment service of China’s three major settlement services; Wechat Pay, Alipay, and UnionPay,” the company explained. Nippon Pay users make these different types of payments using a smartphone app, available for Android and iOS devices. Two additional payment platforms are planned for the end of the year. One is the top mobile payment service in South Korea, Kakao Pay. The other is the most used mobile payment platform in both Thailand and Taiwan, Line Pay. Nippon Pay’s platform is tailored for Chinese tourists visiting Japan. According to a Chinese travel service, Ctrip, Japan is the third most popular destination for the Chinese. The Japan Tourism Agency reported that 6.37 million Chinese visited Japan last year, spending 1.47 trillion yen in the land of the rising sun. Unionpay is the largest card payment organization in the world. It also offers mobile and online payments and operates under the approval of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Alibaba Group’s Alipay and Tencent Group’s Wechat Pay are the two major smartphone payment services in China. These three providers collectively represent over 70 percent of the Chinese market, accounting for approximately $2.9 trillion USD worth of online payments during 2016, according to payments technology platform Dlocal. This latest venture with Nippon Pay adds to Bitpoint’s list of impressive Bitcoin merchant projects. The company made headlines back in May when it partnered with Peach Aviation to introduce various Bitcoin services to the travel industry. Soon after, the company revealed that it was in talks with potential partners to add bitcoin payments to over 100,000 stores in Japan. Then earlier this month, it revealed a partnership with Japan’s largest online travel agent to bring bitcoin payments to over 1,400 hotels this summer.

Also Read: Assisting in Bitcoin Purchases for Ransomware May Be Illegal in the US Anthony Murgio pleaded guilty to three conspiracy counts, including bank fraud and operating an unlicensed money transmitting business. The thirty-three-year-old is the former operator of coin.mx, a bitcoin exchange that has been suspected of assisting hackers launder cryptocurrency and has been linked to a data breach at JPMorgan Chase & Co.  Coin.mx has been accused of processing millions of dollars between 2013 and 2015 despite being unlicensed. Prosecutors said that Murgio and co-conspirators processed funds on behalf of the victims and owners of bitcoin-based ransomware programs. Assistant U.S. Attorney Eun Choi described Mr. Murgio’s facilitation of ransomware victims accessing bitcoin as “exploit[ing] their desperation to personally profit from them.” Many within the cryptocurrency have raised concerns about Murgio getting charged for aiding the victims of ransomware to obtain bitcoins, arguing that such could lead to bitcoin exchanges being unwilling to work with ransomware victims – rendering ransomware victim’s unable to prevent the deletion of important files and data when required. It is also alleged that a since-liquidated New Jersey credit union was taken over in order to obscure their financial activity, with Antony Murgio’s father pleading guilty to an obstruction of justice charges pertaining to the credit union. The criminal investigations have seen nine individuals charged with felonies relating to the JPMorgan hack, which breached more than 83 million accounts.  Manhattan U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan described Coin.mx’s illegal activities as “an effort based on ambition and greed”, and Mr. Murgio as having created a “pyramid of lies”. Antony Murgio was emotional throughout the proceedings, on numerous occasions losing composure whilst expressing his “enormous regret”. “Believing what I was doing was OK did not make it OK,” Murgio stated. “I am wiser today than when the case began, and I am sorry for all the damage I caused to so many people.” In March, a Manhattan jury convicted New Jersey pastor Trevon Gross and Florida software engineer Yuri Lebedev of scheming to conceal Coin.mx’s activities from banks and regulators. The two individuals are currently awaiting sentencing. Coin.mx’s owner, Gery Shalon, has pleaded not guilty to U.S charges following his extradition from Israel.

The option to use the decentralized currency at Burger King Russia locations is expected to be rolled out across a few more restaurants in the country by the end of the summer. Also Read: How ‘Bitcoin City’ Arnhem Signed Up Its 100th Merchant, Burger King Bitcoin in Russia has been growing popular, and the country’s government authorities are expected to officially acknowledge and regulate the cryptocurrency in the near future. Now according to reports, Dmitri Medovoy, the general director of Burger King Russia says the fast food franchise is looking for a developer to install a bitcoin payment processing software for the restaurant’s cash registers and Burgerking.ru apps. “The company plans to announce the winner of the tender for development of software that would enable us to accept bitcoins,” details the Russian Burger King’s general director. “The contractor will have to develop solutions for Burgerking.ru, the mobile apps for Android and iOS, and cash registers on R-keeper,” Medovoy has been determined to make Burger King a “market leader” in Russia by planning for the expansion of more restaurants in the Siberian region. Currently, the Burger King franchise only has shops in Yekaterinburg, St. Petersburg, and Moscow. Uznay Vse details Burger King Russia accepting bitcoin payments is one the first initial steps towards mainstream merchant services accepting cryptocurrencies in the country.           “Burger King is watching new trends closely, so we decided to launch this project. Cryptocurrency payments are the immediate future,” Medovoy explains. The Burger King announcement follows the Deputy Head of Russia’s Ministry of Finance Alexey Moiseev’s recent statements towards introducing regulatory guidelines for cryptocurrency purchases. Additionally, the central bank of Russia has been working on a proposal to classify bitcoin as a digital asset for tax purposes. The Russian Burger King will not be the only Burger King brand fast food franchise that accepts bitcoin, as a restaurant in the Dutch city of Arnhem location also accepts the cryptocurrency for food services.

2017-06-28T11:00:11-04:00,Colombia Clarifies Stance on Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/colombia-stance-bitcoin/,"Colombia’s top financial regulator published a circular about digital currency last week, naming bitcoin several times. Citing its potential risks, the authority clarified its stance on the cryptocurrency. Also read: Colombia’s Poor Banking Infrastructure Great Potential for Bitcoin The Colombian government and central bank have made statements in the past about bitcoin, but no laws have been passed and a clear definition has yet to emerge of how the law treats bitcoin in the country. While Colombian banks have been restricted from handling it, the number of bitcoin users in the country has been growing substantially. At Localbitcoins, the weekly volume for Colombian pesos surpassed 2 billion, worth roughly $663,000 USD, for the first time at the end of May. Head of the Financial Superintendency of Colombia, Jorge Castaño Gutiérrez, published a circular last week, clarifying the regulator’s stance on the digital currency. Referencing past circulars, Gutiérrez reiterated that no digital currency has been recognized as currency by the legislator or the monetary authority. Citing Article 6 of Law 31 of 1992, he said Colombia’s only monetary unit and unit of account is the peso issued by Banco de la Republica. In addition, Article 8 of the same law states that legal currency, which consists of banknotes and coins, must be expressed in the peso and “will be the only legal means of payment.” He described, “bitcoin is not an asset that can be considered a currency because it does not have the support of the central banks of any countries,” affirming that: Gutiérrez maintained that digital currencies do not have value under the capital markets reform bill, known as Law 964 of 2005, therefore they are not part of the Colombian securities market infrastructure. They do not constitute a valid investment and their operators are not authorized to advise and/or manage operations on them. He detailed: While digital currency is not banned in the country, the Superintendency reminded the general public in the circular that “it is up to each person to understand and assume the risks inherent in virtual currencies if they choose to deal with them, since they are not protected by any type of private or state guarantee,” Gutiérrez explained. “Its operations are also not eligible for coverage by deposit insurance.” The circular reiterated that digital currency businesses are “not authorized to guard, invest, mediate or operate with these instruments, nor allow the use of their platforms to carry out operations with digital currency.” Businesses that persist in using digital currencies are also urged to continue to apply adequate and sufficient measures to prevent them from being used as a tool for money laundering and the channeling of resources towards terrorist activities. The reason for such a strong position is the prevalence of investment scams in the region. The presence of many Colombian bitcoin-based Ponzi schemes prompted the Superintendency to warn the public about the risks of “bitcoin” and further prohibited banks from dealing with it earlier this year. Bitcoin.com has recently reported that nearby Bolivia has a similar problem with pyramid schemes masquerading as cryptocurrency investments. In an interview with La.FM last week, Gutiérrez warned that pyramid schemes that use bitcoin to raise money from Colombians could face up to 20 years prison time. He detailed that these schemes have criminal consequences including imprisonment, both for those who organize these businesses and for those who promote them.

Also Read: Malaysian Bitcoin Users Divest Carefully Into LTC and ETH A recent survey conducted by HSBC showed that 59% of consumers had not heard of blockchain technology. Of the 41% of respondents who were familiar with the technology underpinning bitcoin, 80% stated that they did not understand how blockchain technology operates.  The survey polled 2,000 HSBC customers from the United Kingdom, in addition to 1,000 participants from Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Mexico, Singapore, the United Arab Emirates and the United States respectively. HSBC’s report adds to a growing list of surveys that indicate bitcoin and blockchain technology is still in its early years of development, with early-majority adoption still yet to be seen. A survey conducted by Cambridge University this year determined the current number of unique active users of cryptocurrency wallets is estimated to be between 2.9 and 5.8 million. Despite representing just 0.04 – 0.05% of the global population, this data indicates that the bitcoin userbase has at least doubled in just two years. With such a tiny percentage of citizens actively engaged in the bitcoin community, 40% of citizens being aware of blockchain technology evidences the enormous growth potential of cryptocurrency. Monex, Inc., Tradestation Securities, Inc., and Monex Boom Securities (H.K) Limited released a survey this month that polled retail investors holding accounts with China, Japan, and the United States respectively. The results showed that only 3% of Japanese and US retail investors are actively investing in cryptocurrency, with 10% of Chinese investors reporting that they were investing in cryptocurrency. 20% of Chinese and US-based retail investors reported that they were not at all familiar with cryptocurrency. Nearly all polled Japanese investors had heard of bitcoin and cryptocurrency, likely owing to Japan’s highly publicized liberal legal apparatus surrounding cryptocurrency.  Despite the recent spike in bitcoin’s media coverage, it would appear that the majority of people are still unfamiliar with bitcoin and blockchain technology. With consumer polls in developed nations indicating that 59% of citizens are still unfamiliar with blockchain technology and only a small minority of retail investors are actively involved in the Japanese, Chinese and US cryptocurrency markets, it would appear that bitcoin still has enormous growth potential.

Also Read: Indian Bitcoin Adoption Responds to Government Signalling for Regulation Major Indian bitcoin exchange, Unocoin, went offline late Monday night following the discovering of a significant security flaw. Unocoin CEO and co-founder, Sathvik Vishwanath, is anticipating that Unocoin will return to regular operations by the “end of day Tuesday”. “We identified that there was an issue with the way the files were being stored and are resolving that part. We are also moving the servers to a more secure location,” Vishwanath told the Economic Times India in a recent interview.  The company has stressed that all customer funds are safe, but has mandated that users change passwords upon logging into their accounts. Technical specifications pertaining to the security vulnerability and its discovery have not been publicly disclosed. The vulnerabilities have surfaced just weeks after a data scientist from Bengaluru had his Unocoin account hacked. The hacking victim, who concealed his identity, reported that upon logging into his account, he immediately received an email with a link for a password reset, and then an email confirming that his password had been changed. Upon realizing that his account was being hacked, the individual then became aware that two transactions had been initiated moving approximately 0.3 and 0.4 bitcoin from his account. The data scientist quickly sent an email to Unocoin, before driving to their local Bengaluru headquarters. Unocoin was able to lock his account and prevent a third unauthorized transaction from occurring, but unfortunately had already processed the first two transactions.  Many within the cryptocurrency community are speculating that the vulnerabilities discovered by Unocoin may have been exploited by those who hacked the data scientist’s account, although Unocoin has not made a statement addressing said speculation. Unocoin has seen an increase in transactions, account verification requests and customer support queries following the increased media exposure of bitcoin heading into June. Along with the increase in customer base, Unocoin has also seen an increase in reported wallet hacks – with the company claiming that it saw nine cases last month, more than double the monthly average of just 3 or 4. As a precautionary measure, the company has temporarily reduced its automatic transaction approval threshold to 0.1btc, as opposed to the normal limit at 0.5btc. Have you ever had your wallet hacked?

The institute cites a large underbanked population, underdeveloped financial apparatus, and rampant inflation as major economic and social problems that could be addressed by bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Also Read: Indian Bitcoin Adoption Responds to Government Signalling for Regulation Pakistani independent economic policy think-tank, The Policy Research Institute of Market Economy (PRIME), has articulated a number of prescient use-cases for bitcoin in Pakistan. In an article entitled Money Systems: Why Rupee Should Mimic Bitcoin, the researchers allude to a number of economic and social problems within Pakistan that cryptocurrency could help alleviate.  The article first discusses Pakistani inflation, drawing attention to recent governments recklessly printing rupees. The article asserts that since 2010, the Pakistani government has increased monetary resources at an average annual rate of 16.4% despite the average annual growth of real GDP having been just 3.8%, which “bears [an] adverse effect on the value of rupee as evident from the recurring bouts of inflation.” As such, the pre-defined scarcity of bitcoin’s token distribution is extremely appealing to PRIME, who advocate that Pakistani adopt a similar “rule-based” monetary system that guides the release of new money into circulation. PRIME identify poor access to banking services as a significant barrier to widespread Pakistani economic development, citing The World Bank’s Global Findex Report of 2014 to argue that only 13% of adult Pakistani citizens own a bank account. PRIME make comparisons to the historically unheralded access to basic financial services that cryptocurrencies and mobile-based payment apps have yielded in Africa, arguing that a similar financial architecture should be developed in order to promote growth across the Pakistani economy. With India taking recent steps toward cryptocurrency liberalization and a further digitization of the Indian economy, it is likely that we will see an increase in the volume of bitcoin and cryptocurrency-related rhetoric and policy coming from Pakistan.  PRIME’s article comes a month after announcements that the Pakistan Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) would begin investigating the potential use of bitcoin for money laundering or tax evasion purposes. The FBR’s announcement has done little to dampen bitcoin traction in Pakistan, as localbitcoins saw its highest ever week for Pakistani bitcoin trading volume the week following media coverage of the FBR’s investigations.

2017-06-27T10:00:12-04:00,The Contradictions of the Alt-Right Embracing Bitcoin for Crowdfunding,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-contradictions-of-the-altright-embracing-bitcoin-for-crowdfunding/,"Alt-Right leaders are increasingly turning to bitcoin to conduct fundraising following account closures from leading crowdfunding platforms. Despite the libertarian underscoring of many cryptocurrency projects, the use of bitcoin poses several fundamental challenges to altright ideology. Also Read: Russian GPU Prices Spike, Miners Turn to International Markets for Graphics Cards Since its inception, bitcoin has been lauded by the libertarian-leaning constituent of the right wing community. The realization of decentralization, trustless financial autonomy, and peer-to-peer transactions without third party verifications have obvious appeals to proponents of small government. Despite the appeals of cryptocurrency with hard-right leaning groups, few expected that bitcoin would increasingly become popularized as a tool embraced by altright political organizations.  In a move apparently at odds with the altright’s ideological leaning, crowdfunding has increasingly become a staple business model for many ‘white nationalists’. The reliance upon small donors has occurred due to many advertisers being unwilling to be associated with individuals perceived to be racist or hateful, as well as many vocal ‘white nationalists’ finding themselves with limited employment opportunities outside of the movement. The transition towards crowdfunding has been a bumpy road, however, as many popular crowdfunding platforms have closed the accounts of altright individuals seeking to utilize their platforms, sparking the increasing popularization of bitcoin among pro-white figures. Kyle Chapman, a 42-year-old ex-con who has risen to prominence within the altright following the circulation of videos of Chapman assaulting anti-fascist protesters, started an account with Gofundme to raise money for bail, only to have his account suspended for violating the website’s terms of service. “In this particular instance we removed it because it was in defense or support of anyone involved in criminal activity”, Gofundme said with regards to Chapman’s account. Chapman then attempted set up a crowdfunding campaign with Paypal, who also shut down his account following the surfacing of more footage depicting Chapman’s violence. Although some altright personalities have been able to fund campaigns via Patreon, self-identified white nationalist Emily Youcas had her Patreon account removed recently, illustrating the shortage of financing options available to outspoken ‘white nationalists’. The increasing restriction of viable means for the altright to generate revenue has resulted in a reliance on small donors, including heavy encouragement of donations in the form of bitcoin. “Bitcoin is the currency of the alt right,” read a recent tweet from www.altright.com co-editor, Richard Spencer. The for-profit organization accepts monthly donations of between $10 and $60 and annual donations of between $1,000 and $10,000, accepting donations in the form of bitcoin, cash, or Paypal. Neo-nazi website www.dailystormer.com also encourages bitcoin donations, launching a crowdfunding campaign for the website’s legal defense budget last month that promotes bitcoin as its preferred means of donation  Aside from the curious reliance of right-wing figures upon donations as a source of revenue, it is surprising that ‘white nationalists’ have been so quick to embrace a network dominated by Chinese miners. With much of the security and robustness of the bitcoin network reliant upon actors disparately located across the world, the United States’ position of dominance within cryptocurrency seeing a sustained demise since 2012, and rising transaction fees, the altright’s increasing adoption of bitcoin will generate considerable revenue for international bitcoin miners in the future through transaction fees.

The modified law introduces specific definitions and articles with regards to virtual currency exchanges that facilitate trading between fiat currencies and bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Also Read: European Commission launches Digital Currency and Dark Web Consortium  The European Parliament is yet to approve the proposed modification of current anti-money laundering laws that were published in Italy late last month. The Italian Minister of Economy initiated discussion pertaining to the draft legislation in December 2016. The modified law, AML4, was introduced in Italy with its publication in the Italian Official Journal of the Legislative Decree 25th May 2017.  The proposed legislation contains numerous articles that directly address cryptocurrencies, in addition to introducing a specific registry for Virtual Currency Exchanges. The current legislative decree recognized by the European Commission defines virtual currency as “a digital representation of value that is neither issued by a central bank or a public authority, nor attached to a legally established fiat currency which can be used as a means of exchange for the purchase of goods and services and transferred, stored and traded electronically.” Cryptocurrency exchanges are defined as virtual service providers: “any natural or legal person providing professional services to third parties for the use, the exchange, the storage related of virtual currencies and for the conversion from or in currencies having legal tender[.]” The proposed amendments defines a virtual currency ‘exchanger’ as a “[provider] engaged primarily and professionally in exchange services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies”.  Although the changes are subtle, the classification of virtual currency exchanges as entities differing from conventional money exchanges allows the development of tailored policy designed to address potential issues specific to virtual currency exchanges. The proposed decree mandates that virtual currency providers gain licensed authorization from the nation state in which they are based. “Member States shall ensure that providers of exchanging services between virtual currencies and fiat currencies, custodian wallet providers, currency exchange and cheque cashing offices, and trust or company service providers are licensed or registered, and that providers of gambling services are regulated.” Experts are expecting the European Parliament will likely vote on the provisions sometime after October 2017.

The event schedule has a vast array of hacking exhibits and keynote presentations, but one notable group of Def Con demonstrators on the list claims they will show the audience how to break a bitcoin hardware wallet. Also read: Onecoin Operators Get In Trouble Again In Three More Countries The Def Con conference is one of the world’s biggest hacker conventions held in Nevada every year since 1993. The event hosts a multitude of tracks, demonstrations, and speakers from computer security experts, tech journalists, hackers, and government cyber specialists. This year’s Def Con 25 will have a lot going on as the audience will hear about jailbreaking Android and Apple gear, Opsec techniques, the evolution of DDoS attacks, abusing certificates, drone defense markets, and more. One demonstration dubbed “Breaking Bitcoin Hardware Wallets” has sparked interest within the bitcoin ecosystem. The 20-minute presentation will showcase Josh Datko, and Chris Quartier of the company Cryptotronix sharing their tools and methods that allegedly can break a bitcoin hardware wallet. “In this presentation, we will quickly overview fault injection techniques, timing, and power analysis methods using the Open Source Hardware tool, the Chip Whisperer,” explains the Cryptotronix demonstration summary. Cryptotronix backs their claims with a study done in 2015 by developer Jochen Hoenicke who was able to extract a Trezor’s private key using a $70 oscilloscope. The tool is an electronic testing instrument which allows the observation of various signals within devices. Many people believe side channel attacks like the one Hoenicke demonstrated are difficult tasks to achieve, but Hoenicke believes they are relatively easy to perform.     “Side channel attacks are not as difficult as many people think,” details Hoenicke in 2015. “A simple power analysis requires only a simple oscilloscope, and that can hardly be called expensive laboratory equipment. You also need basic soldering skills and deep knowledge of the code that is running.” Since then Trezor has patched these vulnerabilities found in 2015, and Hoenicke was in contact with the manufacturer Satoshi Labs throughout his investigation. However, Cryptotronix says in their demonstration summary, that although the vulnerability was patched the hardware wallets still do not have a “Microcontroller” and “[They] may be vulnerable to additional side channel attacks.” Across forums, many bitcoiners are skeptical of the upcoming demonstration that will be taking place in Vegas next month, but stated they would be watching this closely. Some proponents said they hoped Cryptotronix would also release a responsible disclosure first to bitcoin hardware manufacturers before showcasing the hack. Others said research and tools like this might up the stakes so that next generation bitcoin devices can protect themselves in the future. “Bitcoin hardware wallets help protect against software-based attacks to recover or misuse your key. However, hardware attacks on these wallets are not as well studied,” reveals the Cryptotronix demonstration synopsis. What do you think about the bitcoin hardware wallet demonstration that will take place at Def Con 25? Do you believe they possess tools that can exploit vulnerabilities found in these wallets? Do you think their research is a good thing so hardware companies can up their security game? Let us know in the comments below.

Also Read: UK Regulator Warns Investors Bitcoin Trading is Risk It has been announced that Barclays has been engaged in active dialogue with UK regulators about bringing bitcoin “into play” within the UK fintech industry. Barclay CEO, Ashok Vaswani, told CNBC that Barclays previously has met with the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), Britain’s chief regulatory watchdog overseeing the fintech industry, to discuss virtual currency regulations.  Although the discussion began specifically on the topic of blockchain technology, the interview soon turned to bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. “I’ve actually gone… to the FCA, to talk about how we could bring… cryptocurrencies into play”, Ashok Vaswani told CNBC. Despite Barclays’ evident interest in the cryptocurrency markets and economy, the CEO appears to view virtual currencies with cautious optimism. “Obviously [it’s] a new area, an arena we’ve got to be careful with. We are working our way through it.” The executive director of strategy for the FCA, Chris Woolard, has recently iterated that businesses and institutions must adopt a cautious approach when dealing with cryptocurrency but also stressed that FCA has not taken a prohibitory stance with regards to bitcoin and blockchain technology. “We don’t prohibit regulated firms from engaging in digital currency trading, nor do we prohibit banks from offering banking services to deal with currency firms that use [blockchain]. I am not saying that we view digital currencies as an inherently bad thing… but we do have to exercise a degree of caution.” Outside of announcing Barclays’ meetings with the FCA, Ashok Vaswani gave little elaboration on future plans the bank may have for further engagement within the cryptocurrency space. Barclays partnered with social payments app Circle last year, which facilitates the transmission of funds via messenger app and features support for bitcoin transactions.  Barclays is among a growing number of large financial institutions who are advocating for a permissive regulatory apparatus for the cryptocurrency markets. Despite pressure from the fintech industry, many commentators are predicting that it will take governments years to develop a comprehensive legal framework designed for the unique challenges and opportunities that bitcoin and other virtual currencies present. Do you think that major banks showing an interest in bitcoin is positive for the network, or do you think that greater involvement in cryptocurrency by major financial institutions undermines the core values of bitcoin?

Bitcoin adoption is growing, however, as more stores start to embrace the digital currency. The largest and most recent store to accept bitcoin in the shopping district is Bic Camera, a leading consumer electronics retailer chain in Japan. The chain opened its first store in Akihabara on Thursday and started accepting bitcoin on the same day using Bitflyer, Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume. This is its third location to accept the digital currency. The first two locations still accept and promote bitcoin today. Besides Bic Camera, there are some other smaller stores that accept bitcoin in the district. Ark computer shop accepts both bitcoin and the local favorite altcoin called Monacoin for payments starting earlier this month. Ark sells PC parts and game devices. The company partnered with Osaka-based Tech Bureau Co, the parent company of the bitcoin exchange Zaif, in order to accept the cryptocurrency. In addition to retail stores, there are other types of businesses accepting bitcoin there as well. Dualtap Property Management in Akihabara, for example, recently announced that it is accepting bitcoin through Coincheck, another prominent bitcoin exchange in Japan. The company provides one-stop services involving property development, sales, management and building maintenance internationally and domestically. Some food establishments also accept bitcoin such as Au Tokyoite, a restaurant and wine bar featuring cheese fondue and Swiss cuisine in Akihabara. While most stores still do not accept bitcoin directly, many of them accept smart cards such as the popular Suica and Pasmo cards. Both use Sony’s Felica technology. Bitcoin.com recently reported that Felica Marketing is working on turning these smart cards into bitcoin hardware wallets. If launched, customers will have the option to pay with bitcoin at many more stores in Akihabara through their contactless smart cards.

2017-06-25T12:00:55-04:00,Six Legal Issues Bitcoin Faces in South Korea,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/six-legal-issues-bitcoin-faces-south-korea/,"South Korea currently has no regulations regarding bitcoin, even as the digital currency has gained immense popularity following its recent price spikes. Lawyer Kim Kyung Hwan outlines the six most important legal issues surrounding bitcoin in the country. Also read: Why South Korean Bitcoin Adoption Could Outpace Most Other Countries This Year Kim is a lawyer, patent attorney, and tax accountant in South Korea. He is also a member of the National Assembly Secretariat which provides support services to lawmakers such as legislative research and administrative supports. In 2015, he was selected by the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Energy to receive the Industrial Technology Protection award by Korea Internet & Security Agency (KISA). In an article published in Chosun on Friday, Kim noted how the rise in bitcoin’s price prompted more people in South Korea to get involved. However, the country does not have regulations for the cryptocurrency. This causes uncertainty and “a lot of trouble” for anyone making bitcoin transactions, he said, adding that: He then outlined six legal issues of digital currencies pertinent to South Korea. The first and most fundamental legal issue is whether bitcoin is money, a security or an asset, Kim began. The South Korean Financial Services Commission has said they will propose a regulatory framework for Bitcoin-based businesses this year. The Commission, the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, the Bank of Korea, the Financial Supervisory Service, academics and legal experts met in November last year. They started a debate about the legal definition of bitcoin, the exchange registration system, and anti-money laundering. However, no guidelines have been announced yet. Kim noted (loosely translated): The second issue is whether to impose VAT or consumption tax on bitcoin purchases. Kim cited countries where bitcoin is considered an asset impose VAT and “Korea belongs here as well,” he conveyed. “However, the international trend towards VAT is on the way to exemption,” he detailed, giving the example of Japan having revised its law to exempt bitcoin purchases from consumption tax. Another issue he brought up is the need to overcome problems such as money laundering. “Korea considers digital currency as a commodity, and since telecom dealers are not obligated to prevent money laundering, there is no regulation yet,” he explained. The fourth issue is whether digital currency businesses including exchanges need to register or notify any authorities. “A person who wants to conduct an exchange business now reports it as a telecommunications dealer under the Electronic Commerce Act. However, it can not be regarded as a regulation specific to virtual money,” he detailed. He then cited Japan’s new amended law to require bitcoin exchange businesses to register with the Prime Minister, be regularly audited and also be supervised by the Prime Minister. The fifth issue concerns bitcoin remittances, when bitcoin is transferred and converted into won or other foreign currency. The current Foreign Exchange Transaction Act states that foreign exchange transfers including remittances can only be done through a financial company. “According to the interpretation of the Ministry of Strategy and Finance, it is important to note that many bitcoin providers may be in violation of the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act,” Kim explained. However, starting on July 18, the law allows small-scale foreign exchange transactions for non-financial companies. This will significantly improve remittances in the country as the traditional banking practice is expensive and cumbersome, he indicated. Bitcoin.com recently reported on a leading mobile commerce company, Omnitel, which started a bitcoin remittance business in order to lower the cost of remittances as well as the time taken. The last issue Kim mentioned concerns Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) which have gained popularity lately. “There are similar schemes such as IPOs (initial public offerings) or crowdfunding in the capital market in Korea, but they are clearly different,” he explained. The issue also needs to be addressed as well. When do you think South Korea will catch up to Japan’s regulations on bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-06-25T06:00:35-04:00,Markets Update: After Some Stability Bitcoin Price Trends Downwards,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-stability-bitcoin-price-trends-downwards/,"On June 24 the price of bitcoin dipped down 7 percent to a low of $2512 USD after remaining relatively stable at $2680-2700 for the past few days.  Also Read: Scheduled Scaling Updates for the Bitcoin Network Are Getting Closer As bitcoin maintained the $2700 average, a few bitcoin traders were probably getting bored because the price didn’t show much movement. However, bitcoin’s value fell against the U.S. dollar five solid legs down starting at 10 am EST on Saturday. After taking a steep drop and coming close to going below the sub $2500 range the price of bitcoin bounced back a leg up to $2585 but has since been consolidating around the $2530 territory. Bitcoin trade volume has been lower which is typical on the weekends hovering at $979 million in 24-hour volume at the time of writing. Market dominance for BTC has been holding steady at 39 percent due to lower ethereum prices. The price per ethereum after last week’s ETH market flash crash has been holding just above the $300 range. As of right now both bitcoin and ethereum markets are experiencing a bearish sell-off and are trying to find a solid floor.  Looking at the 24-hour charts, the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and the longer term 200 SMA have crossed hairs, and the 100 SMA is now a touch below the 200 trendline. The retreating price hasn’t found channel support just yet, but it looks like we may be sitting at least above the $2500 territory for a few hours. Relative Strength Index is heading down confirming the current seller’s market, and stochastic indicators also show bearish sentiment which will likely continue for a bit. Day traders will find easy scalps and breaks during these times as the price should show some profit taking shake-ups. The weekly news has been interesting as there have been numerous headlines about the decentralized currency lately. For instance, the Indian government just revealed it would soon be regulating bitcoin, and the news may lead to some positive developments in the region. In other news, the scaling proposal Segwit2x saw massive hashrate support this past week, and some believe bitcoin just might upgrade in the near future. Traditional markets like stocks and bonds have been quite shaky over the previous two weeks, and the recent ethereum market flash crash seems to have all altcoin markets in a frenzy. For now, bitcoin’s price is trying its best to stay within the $2520-2540 territory but is struggling to hold solid ground. From the looks of the weekly chart and Fibonacci extensions, we could see dip lower into the 2400 zone if bears continue to shake up the market. Alternatively, the price could push upwards after a short period of profit taking and try to breach the $2800 levels once again. Asian and European markets will decide where the next twelve hours will lead us as they could buy the dips or we continue seeing Judas candles. Bear Scenario: Order books show at the moment there should be a sound base around the $2450 vicinity. However, there are a lot of short positions contracts betting the price may go lower back to the $2200-2300 range. Back to $2100 would be worst case scenario looking at the playing cards at press time. Bull Scenario: The price could catch some upward momentum during the midday hours of trading for Asian and European markets. We could see a rally back to the $2700 range by Monday if some buy pressure steps in but at the moment big players are waiting for lower prices. Getting close to $3000 will take some time as bulls will have to smash through some significantly sized sell walls. What do you think about the price dipping down 10% to just above $2500 on June 24th? Do you think the price will regain its bullish momentum? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-06-24T19:00:32-04:00,Scheduled Scaling Updates for the Bitcoin Network Are Getting Closer,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/scheduled-scaling-updates-for-the-bitcoin-network-are-getting-closer/,"Over the past six months, the bitcoin scaling debate has been going on relentlessly as many cryptocurrency proponents are trying to figure the best solution to improve the network’s fees and transaction throughput. There have been many ideas brought to the table, but this summer there are some specific plans that all bitcoin holders should keep on their radar. Also Read: 70 Percent of the Bitcoin Hashrate Begins Signaling Segwit2x The block size debate has been going on since Satoshi Nakamoto put a 1MB limit on blocks in 2010, which only allows for a certain amount of transactions per block. More recently the ‘community’ has been divided talking about a variety of ideas that could help blocks hold more transactions as bitcoin becomes increasingly more popular. One of the ideas right now is Segregated Witness (Segwit), a soft fork protocol designed to remove witness data from transactions which theoretically will add more space for additional transactions. Then the other side of the community wants to implement a hard fork that would change the 1MB block size limit to either 2MB, 4MB, 8MB, or even unlimited block space. For a long time now Bitcoin proponents have yet to implement any of these plans. There has been a stalemate for quite some time between businesses, users, miners, and many individuals involved in the bitcoin economy. Now certain members of the bitcoin community seem to be moving a lot closer to attempts towards activating their plans on the bitcoin network. UASF (user activated soft fork) USAF or BIP 148 stands for a “user activated soft fork,” which is an idea that proposes full nodes can activate Segwit on the bitcoin network. The concept was first introduced in February by an anonymous pseudonym named Shaolinfry. The creator of UASF believes Segwit can be implemented on the network by utilizing the vote of full nodes similar to the P2SH soft fork (BIP16) that took place in the past. However, BIP 148 is a fork that will also require miners to deploy the existing Segwit protocol. “‘Flag Day’ — Prior to August 1st, 2017, miners should either; update their node software to a BIP148-enforcing version; or run a BIP148 border node to filter out invalid blocks, and update their existing mining software to produce blocks with version 1 bit enabled, to vote for Segwit activation,” explains the UASF Working Group website. On forums and social media, there seems to be a good following of people who support the UASF movement, while others would disagree and say there isn’t much BIP 148 support at all. As far as node count is concerned, there are 918 nodes signaling BIP 148 out of 7441 total full bitcoin nodes at the time of writing. The UASF Working Group website and many others within the community have also admitted to the fact that UASF can split the bitcoin blockchain. UAHF (user activated hard fork) Due to this concern on June 15 the ASIC manufacturer and mining pool operator, Bitmain announced a protection plan for this event. The Beijing-based company revealed its UAHF contingency plan (user activated hard fork) because the company believes “the UASF chain presents a risk of the original chain being wiped out.” Bitmain believes a UASF poses a threat to the network and will support a defensive hard fork and are also producing replay protection software. The company states it will have software built for this contingency plan by the end of this month. “Currently, there are at least three client development teams working on the code of the spec,” explains Bitmain. “All of them want to stay quiet and away from the propaganda and troll army of certain companies. They will announce themselves when they feel ready for it. Users will be able to install the software and decide whether to join the UAHF. The software is expected to be ready before July 1st, and it will be live on testnet by then.” Segwit2x The next plan on the horizon is called Segwit2x, an idea that mixes Segwit with a 2MB hard fork. Segwit2x was originally designed by Sergio Demian Lerner of Rootstock and has evolved into a pact made at the Consensus Conference — Otherwise known as the “New York Agreement.” The covenant was announced by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group which said 58 bitcoin-based companies backed the plan alongside 83 percent of the network hashrate as well.  Since then a working group has been building on the project led by bitcoin developer and Bloq CEO, Jeff Garzik. The group released the alpha code for Segwit2x on June 16, and since then a vast majority of pool operators have started signaling support for the protocol upgrade. Segwit2x scaling is currently being signaled by mining pools such as Bixin, BTC.top, F2pool, 1hash, Viabtc, BW.com, Bitclub, Antpool, BTCC, and others. Furthermore, the Segwit2x working group has also been working to make certain parts of the UASF compatible with its plan. As of right now the signals mostly show ‘intent to support’ the protocol, in the end, eighty percent of the hashrate must signal bit 4 which essentially will lock in BIP 91. If this happens, they must continue the support through 336 blocks in order to activate Segwit. Then a 2MB hard fork following a similar process 12,960 blocks later (3 months) is planned to follow. “The prediction is that miners activate rapidly. Therefore, block 485218 becomes the hard fork point. “+3 months” is the fallback safety measure, in case activation is slower than predicted,” explains Jeff Garzik. People right now including the developers of these plans cannot predict the exact results of these planned events. UASF supporters hope the majority hashrate will follow their lead creating a snowball effect towards what they believe will be the prominent chain. Others are skeptical of Segwit2x and think that if Segwit is activated the other half of the bargain will not be fulfilled. There are also those who vehemently oppose both of these ideas for one reason or another. Both of these plans may or may not happen but are planned by supporters to take place over the course of the next three months. If they do happen, ordinary users should know that if they hold their own private keys in a non-custodial wallet, they don’t need to do anything. Those holding money on trading platforms will have to deal with the exchange’s decisions. What do you think about the scaling plans slated to happen over the next few months?

2017-06-24T12:00:20-04:00,Cryptobuyer Installs First Bitcoin ATMs in Latin American Commercial Bank,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptobuyer-installs-first-bitcoin-atms-in-latin-american-commercial-bank/,"Major Latin American cryptocurrency and digital assets company, Cryptobuyer, has installed two bitcoin ATMs on the premises of a commercial bank in Panama City. Also Read: Bitinka Announces Expansion of Bitcoin-Based Payment-App Services Across Latin America Cryptobuyer has become the world’s first company to install bitcoin ATMs on the premises of a commercial bank, following the launch of two ATMs at Banismo Bank’s headquarters in Panama City. The installed bitcoin ATMs support DASH transactions in addition to Bitcoin.  Cryptobuyer has ambitious plans for expanding the presence of their bitcoin ATMs across the Latin American continent, announcing its intention to open more than 20 additional bitcoin ATMs throughout South America at the recently-concluded Panamanian Association of Fintech event. Cryptobuyer CEO, Jorge Luis Faris, told news.bitcoin.com that the company plans to “consolidate our position as leaders in Panama, then we will go through Costa Rica, Chile, and Brazil, all these countries have high rates of immigration and old and expensive remittances services that are our main focus.” The Fintech event was hosted by Banismo, the second largest bank in Panama, and featured Jorge Farias participating in an expert panel discussing the potential applications of bitcoin and blockchain technology throughout Latin America. Cryptobuyer is one of many cryptocurrency companies hoping to be at the forefront of driving bitcoin adoption throughout Latin America. With many South American nations accounting for an enormous remittance industry of approximately $70 billion USD in 2015 in addition to housing 400 million underbanked citizens, the positive impacts that widespread bitcoin adoption could have across the continent would be enormous. For many Latin Americans bitcoin’s greatest utility is its ability to store value. Following neoliberal economic restructuring during the 1980’s and 1990’s many Latin American national currencies saw intense volatility in their value. For citizens living in nations like Argentina and Venezuela, the symptoms of hyperinflation have increasingly become embedded in day to day life.  Stories of Argentinian store owners repricing goods multiple times a day are common, making the conducting of basic purchases a constant stress for merchants and customers. Argentina notoriously restricts the ability for its citizens to exchange fiat currencies or to move money outside of the national currency, leaving bitcoin as the virtual sole alternative store of value for most Argentinians. With many Latin Americans turning to bitcoin in order to access its use values, such as being able to store value or circulate remittances, it is unlikely that South American bitcoin adoption will lead to the aggressive price spikes that have been associated with the new markets of China, India, and South Korea in recent years. As such, South American cryptocurrency companies will likely generate greater profits through providing services that cater to the utility of bitcoin, rather than through facilitating speculative trading. Jorge Farias stressed the need for governments to introduce permissive regulations that will guarantee the growth of the cryptocurrency sector throughout the South American continent. “The global trend is to look for simple but safe regulatory environments that do not slow down innovation. Panama, Chile and Brazil are already working on this and although the market is still small it is important that start ups and other actors prepare to be regulated and not die at birth.” Do you think that the Latin American governments will introduce regulations that encourage cryptocurrency businesses?

Also Read: Bitpay’s Bitcoin Prepaid Card Now Available to 131 Countries Leading bitcoin payment processor Bitpay has announced the development of their bitcoin wallet app for Windows Phone users. With Windows accounting for less than 1% of the total smartphone market share, the array of mobile cryptocurrency applications available to Windows smartphone users has been very limited, as many developers have opted to focus their attention on the Apple and Android smartphone markets.  Although Bitpay has catered to the Windows phone market since 2015 in the form of the Copay wallet, Bitpay is excited to integrate Visa debit and other functions not currently available via Copay into its Windows products. Bitpay and Microsoft have partnered previously. In 2014, Bitpay partnered with Microsoft to allow customers to make purchases using bitcoin in the Windows store. When announcing Bitpay’s plans to offer its full wallet services to Windows Phone users, the company stated that “Microsoft’s continued commitment to blockchain technology and interest in smart contracts makes our bitcoin wallet platform – the foundation of many exciting smart contract projects – a powerful addition to the Windows Phone app ecosystem”, suggesting the likelihood of future partnerships between the companies. Many within the bitcoin community do not share Bitpay’s enthusiasm for Microsoft’s explorations into cryptocurrency technology. The recently announced global public-private partnership ID2020 illustrates Microsoft, Accenture and Avanade’s willingness to leverage the blockchain for the purposes of centralization.  The project plans to leverage Accenture’s Unique Identity Service Platform to manage sensitive data such as fingerprints, iris recognition, and biometric data via the blockchain. Although the project is ostensively designed to better assist in the management of refugees and displaced peoples, many within the cryptocurrency community are concerned that said technology could be utilized for more Orwellian purposes. Despite reservation from some within the bitcoin economy regarding Microsoft’s involvement in the ID2020 project, bitcoin adopting Windows Phone users are welcoming the collaboration.

Also Read: State-Funded Bitcoin Data Center Infuriates Montana Locals Approximately one month ago an ad for a luxury Canadian home was listed on the Beijing Craigslist website. The up-market home features eight bedrooms, six bathrooms, and is located right by the Westwood Plateau Golf and Country Club in Coquitlam. The listing features an asking price of 1,075 bitcoins – approximately $2.9 million USD.  With an asking price of nearly $3 million USD and such a narrow marketing strategy, the listing immediately aroused curiosity following its discovery by local British Columbia-based news outlet, The Tri-City News. Although no information is listed pertaining to the property’s owner, the home is listed through Vallee Real State Agent Group, with Eric Vallee listed as the real estate agent to contact for inquiries. The Tri-City News attempted to make contact with Eric Vallee, only to be told that Vallee was out of the office for the week, however another employee called Val Petrov was to handle all inquiries in the mean time. Val Petrov refused to discuss the property with The Tri-City News – who reported that Petrov abruptly stated: “I have no comment” when asked about the property, before immediately terminating the phone call. The property is not the first luxury residence situated in Coquitlam that has been advertised via an overseas Craigslist listing with an asking price quantified in cryptocurrency. Just last month, a five-bedroom, five-bathroom ‘executive-style’ 5,000 square foot property was discovered listed on the Hong Kong Craigslist website, with an asking price of 2,099 bitcoins – approximately $4 million USD at the time. The realtor handling the listing, Mario Figliola of Sutton Centre Realy, told The Tri-City News that the listing was a joke. A few days later The Tri-City News reports being contacted by the manager of Sutton Centre Realty, Derek Drew, who described the advert as an “honest mistake that never should have been made.”  The emergence of two extremely similar, unusual listings advertising luxury Coquitlam homes on East Asian Craiglist websites seems an unlikely coincidence. The Real Estate Council of British Columbia told The Tri-City News that bitcoin cannot be held in trust during a real estate transaction, as virtual currency presently sits outside of the regulatory guidelines applied to banks and government institutions. As such, Canadian real estate sales in bitcoin could risk running afoul of the Financial Transaction and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC) reporting requirements, bringing the legality of said property listings into contention.

Alongside paying for a higher education with bitcoins, now people can utilize the decentralized currency at private daycares and schools that offer the Montessori educational approach for children. Also read: Most Popular Contactless Smart Cards in Japan Adding Bitcoin Hardware Wallets This month Marco Ciocca, co-founder of the Montessori Schools in New York City announced the school would be accepting bitcoin for parents to pay their children’s tuition. A Montessori education created by the Italian educator Maria Montessori promotes independence and freedom within limits. The Montessori Schools in NYC have classrooms in the Flatiron and Soho districts and cost $30,950 for the full-day program. “We looked at the pros and cons of accepting it and decided that now is probably a good time because it’s starting to enter the mainstream,” Ciocca tells the publication Town & Country. “It happens to be that we’re the first pre-kindergarten school to accept it as a form of payment.” According to Ciocca, a “handful” of parents have used the digital currency to pay for tuition so far. When asked whether or not the school thought about bitcoin being associated with illegal activities Ciocca says, “we’re a school, which is wholesome and obviously deals with children.”  Just recently a columnist from the publication Business Insider, Sara Silverstein, explained how she could pay for her daughter’s daycare with bitcoin. Silverstein details that it was an interesting coincidence that the school emailed her about accepting the cryptocurrency because she watched the value of bitcoin rise 30 percent that week.   “The rest of my daughter’s preschool tuition is due on June 1st. I just got a message from the school informing me that they are pleased to announce that they will now be accepting bitcoins for tuition payments,” explains Silverstein.   Silverstein’s daycare and Montessori are not the only schools for children utilizing bitcoin. Indian Mountain School (IMS), an independent private school for kids in pre-kindergarten through grade nine accepts bitcoin for fundraising initiatives. “We believe this opportunity will not only benefit parents but will broaden the horizon for the next generation and afford IMS students an understanding of new technologies that will no doubt impact their futures,” explained Charles Allen an alumnus of IMS when the school announced accepting bitcoin. IMS was the first elementary school in the U.S. to accept bitcoin and the Head of School, Mark A. Devey, thinks digital currency is “an inventive way to bring this out-of-the-box idea home to our students.” What do you think about private schools for children choosing to accept bitcoin for tuition and fundraising?

Also Read: Australian Financial Authorities Look Into Ethereum’s Conflicts of Interest At age twelve Erik Finman put the $1000 his grandmother gave him in bitcoin, in May of 2011. By the end of 2013 Finman’s wealth in BTC grew to be worth $100,000 and the young high school student left his high school to create his own company. The company Finman created was called Botangle, a peer-to-peer tutoring service that offers video chat. In 2015 the young entrepreneur found a buyer who was interested in purchasing his company for either $100,000 or 300 BTC. “The investor offered either $100,000 or 300 bitcoin, which had dropped in value at that time to a little more than $200 a coin,” explains Finman’s AMA. “I took the lower cash value bitcoin deal because I believed it was the next big thing and an official buyout would’ve been very difficult for someone under eighteen and it was good tax planning to use Bitcoin.” Even after his parents let him leave high school (Finman was later homeschooled) to pursue his career in 2015 they told him he didn’t have to attend college if he made his first million by the time he turned eighteen. Through day trading Finman accumulated more bitcoins from the original 300 BTC sale and used some of the funds to create his own virtual reality headset company. In 2017 Finman became a millionaire at eighteen with his BTC holdings and his parents once again let him skip going to school. “I can say today that I own 403 bitcoins which are currently valued at $1,092,678.08 with the price per Bitcoin being at $2,711.36 plus some other money invested in other things,” Finman details. Finman’s first investment in bitcoin at age twelve got him featured in many articles from publications like Mashable. The self-made millionaire says this time around the news outlet CNBC put him through “rigorous proof verification and fact checking” to verify his latest story. During the AMA many people considered Finman lucky, while others said he made some really good investment choices. After CNBC had run the story on Finman, he told the public he kept his bitcoins “super secure,” and “spread out across multiple wallets and multiple machines,” he explains. Finman details that going public with his most recent story has made him “paranoid,” and was scared the media attention would make him a target.

A task force is being set up to provide recommendations. Bitcoin.com spoke with the CEO and co-founder of bitcoin exchange Unocoin, Sathvik Vishwanath, to find out the effect this decision has on Bitcoin adoption in India. Also read: Indian Government to Recommend Bitcoin Regulation Within 6 Months In order to decide whether to regulate bitcoin, the Indian government set up a committee in April to evaluate the situation and provide recommendations. The finance ministry also asked for public comments, most of which are in favor of legalizing and regulating bitcoin. On Tuesday, CNBC aired a news segment announcing that the most of the committee members are in favor of regulating bitcoin. Bitcoin.com interviewed Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of the bitcoin exchange Zebpay, prior to this announcement. He clarified that a task force is being set up and it would take about 6 months for them to come up with recommendations. Unocoin CEO Sathvik Vishwanath has since agreed, confirming that it would take a while for the recommendations to be finalized. Prior to asking for public opinions, the government met with him and other Bitcoin businesses in a “closed door meeting” to discuss bitcoin regulation. While the committee is supposed to deliver a report next month, Vishwanath told Bitcoin.com that “things with Indian government move quite slowly and Bitcoin may not be on their priority list,” adding that: Meanwhile, the public response to the news of Indian bitcoin regulation has been very swift and positive, adding to the momentum that has knocked most bitcoin exchanges offline and has bitcoin’s price trading at a heavy premium. “The growth last month is something we could not handle and ended up with some backlogs and it took two extra weeks to clear up,” Vishwanath noted. “Other players in the market ended up not accepting new users temporarily to clear the backlogs.” He described the customer growth he is seeing on his exchange as “like a hockey stick curve.” He believes the growth will continue, telling Bitcoin.com that: Vishwanath explained that there is a high demand from bitcoiners, but merchant adoption is still small. While there are still “not too many” vendors that accept bitcoin, he said: Nonetheless, even while “trading activities are quite picking up” and merchants are continually signing up, he noted that merchant adoption has slowed “as there is both regulatory uncertainty and high transaction fee for bitcoin transactions.” In addition, “the transaction fee for bitcoin is playing an important role and pushing back the micro transactions.” Do you think bitcoin adoption in India is about to explode? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-06-23T11:00:06-04:00,Netcents and VISA Team up to Offer Bitcoin Purchases via Credit Card,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/netcents-and-visa-team-up-to-offer-bitcoin-purchases-via-credit-card/,"Netcents and VISA have announced a partnership to facilitate the direct purchase of bitcoins using a credit card. Also Read: Cryptocurrency Hedge Funds Outperform Rivals Netcents are a wallet service provider and payment processor that offers cryptocurrency products to businesses and private individuals. The announcement comes just months after a similar partnership was established with Mastercard. Netcents are based in Vancouver, Canada, but provides depositing services to 194 countries. Netcents is registered as a Money Services Business with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre of Canada (FINTRAC).  The partnerships with Visa and Mastercard allow Netcents to be one of the most streamlined services for purchasing cryptocurrency with fiat currency via credit card. The partnership has particularly positive ramifications for Netcents’ woocommerce payment processing plugin, which provides online merchants the ability to accept all fiat currency credit card payments in addition to bitcoin and ethereum payments Although Netcents’ services offer one of the easiest options for a cryptocurrency beginner making their first purchases in the bitcoin markets, some cryptocurrency enthusiasts are arguing that integration between bitcoin businesses and major financial institutions such a Visa or Mastercard undermine many of the core values that underpin cryptocurrency. Using a credit card to purchase cryptocurrency divorces virtual currencies from many of the core use-values that underpins bitcoin’s basic protocol. The innovation of the blockchain, a trustless ledger that comprises a decentralized ledger that can validate and verify transactions without the involvement of third parties, is made essentially inert by the involvement of credit card companies in a transaction. The transaction is immediately dependant upon a centralized third party, and involves paying fees to the credit card companies, Netcents, and Visa or Mastercard, in order to access technology designed to circumvent the very third parties that are now facilitating the transaction.  With bitcoin’s recent price gains appearing to continue, greater cryptocurrency exposure in the media will generate increasing demand for services that provide bitcoin integration into mainstream contemporary architecture. The form that this integration appears to taking shape into is a cause for concern among cryptocurrency devotees. What began as an anarchic project that sought to provide an autonomous alternative to the dominance of neoliberal financial institutions is increasingly being used a tool for profit generation by the very entities that bitcoin originally sought to circumvent. The revolutionary economic vision that many early adopters saw as the future of cryptocurrency is increasingly giving way to an embedding of cryptocurrency into the fabric of mainstream finance, with partnerships like that between Netcents and major credit card providers having the unfortunate effect of sterilizing the disruptive use-values inherent to cryptocurrency.

In addition, the company plans to accept the digital currency for its video streaming service. Also read: South Korea to Dispose of 216 Bitcoins in First Public Auction The revised bill of the Enforcement Decree of the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act of South Korea was finalized on Tuesday, according to Money Today. The amendment provides legal grounds for fintech companies to engage in remittance businesses, which was previously only available to commercial banks. Among companies taking advantage of this amendment is Omnitel, a South Korea-based mobile commerce leader. Established in 1998, the company specializes in mobile broadcasting service and various public services such as disaster alerting service by utilizing the cell broadcasting system platform. Omnitel is a public company listed on Kosdaq, the Korean counterpart of Nasdaq, with 7.77 billion won in capital and about a 70 billion won market cap at press time. In addition to South Korea, the company operates in Algeria, China, Mongolia, Myanmar, Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam, Thailand and Indonesia. Omnitel sells over 70 brand coupons through its network, accounting for over 1,200 products. It streams over 10 media channels and has more than 400 partners, including South Korea’s largest credit card company Samsung Card, wireless telecommunications operator SK Telecom, Hyundai, and Lotte Card. Products and brands include Starbucks, Baskin-Robbins, CVG cinemas, 7-11, the Outback Steakhouse and the largest health care and beauty care chain store in Asia, Watsons. Omnitel is actively working on a smartphone app and services. In line with the newly revised law, Omnitel announced that its subsidiary, Omni Networks (formerly Omni Bank), has entered into a cross-border payments business, according to Money Today. In March, the company announced an investment of 2.4 billion won to acquire an 8.89% stake in BTC Korea.com, the operator of the country’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bithumb. Omnitel said at the time that Bithumb accounts for 70% of the domestic bitcoin trading market, with accumulated trading volume of 2 trillion won in 2016 since the exchange began trading in January 2014. Its daily transaction amount exceeded 3.5 billion won on January 5, earning the operator 4,181 million won in sales and net profit of 2,513 million won, the company detailed. Following this investment, Omni Networks started working on a bitcoin-based foreign exchange (FX) remittance business. The standard FX remittance fees and FX margins charged by banks in South Korea are between 5% and 7%, the company described, adding that it wants to lower commissions to between 8,000 and 13,000 won and FX margins to less than 2%. Moreover, it plans to shorten the transfer time from two to three days to less than one hour. In addition, Omnitel plans to introduce bitcoin payments for mobile streaming content, which it says will differentiate itself from competitors. Bitcoin has been the company’s priority since its price spikes drove high demand in Asia. An Omnitel official said that the company’s first goal is “to rapidly enter the overseas remittance and mobile settlement market.” What do you think about Omnitel entering the Bitcoin space?

2017-06-22T19:00:28-04:00,"Analyst: Like Amazon, Bitcoin Offers a Lucrative Multi-Decade Investment Opportunity",Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/amazon-bitcoin-investment-opportunity/,"A financial analyst looked closely at the spikes in Amazon’s stock price and bitcoin recently. While detailing similarities between the two investments, he explains why bitcoin may be one of the most lucrative trading opportunities for decades. Also read: Most Popular Contactless Smart Cards in Japan Adding Bitcoin Hardware Wallets Education consultant and analyst Gordon Scott published an article on Wednesday explaining how “bitcoin looks a lot like an early Amazon,” referencing the massive spike in Amazon’s stock price that started in 1997. While citing bitcoin “holds real risks,” he believes “there is a real opportunity for traders right now”, adding that: Scott is the Managing Director of the Chartered Market Technician (CMT) program for the Market Technicians Association, a non-profit organization of professional technical analysts headquartered in New York City. Previously, he worked for IBM and TD Ameritrade and spent over 10 years as a trading coach and e-learning consultant. After explaining the importance of blockchains and the tremendous impact they are likely to have on our society, Scott compared a few of bitcoin’s price spikes to that of the huge Amazon spike during the dot-com boom. He felt that the two spikes are similar because in each case investors are seeing a new technology that could change their world. “The latest run-up in the price of bitcoin is an indication that many more people are starting to believe these promises could actually be fulfilled,” Scott said. Amazon went public in May 1997 at $18 per share in an initial public offering (IPO) which valued the company at around $438 million. Citing Amazon’s groundbreaking business model, Scott recalled that “investors were not able to fully and accurately quantify Amazon share value at first.” In 1997, people knew that Amazon had a great idea but they still could not fully give a proper valuation to its shares, he detailed, noting that “consequently, investors had to guess at the company’s value.”  Scott compared the price of Amazon shares from 1997 to 1999 with bitcoin from 2016 to 2017 as well as from 2009 to 2010. The marketplace giant rose more than 6,000% in its first two years after its IPO, he described, noting that “18 years later the peak price from back then looks cheap by comparison today.”  While Amazon’s price surge is still larger than any single bitcoin price surge, Scott pointed out that it happened over a longer period of time than any one of bitcoin’s surges. “Surprisingly, bitcoin’s performance in its first two years only achieved two-thirds of Amazon’s original run-up,” he conveyed, then concluded: Do you think bitcoin will continue to be a great investment opportunity for decades? Let us know in the comments section below.

Bitinka has announced that its popular bitcoin-based payment app, Inkapay, will see significant expansions beginning in July. Starting next month Inkapay will be implementing credit card integration, in addition to new APIs designed for e-commerce integration. Inkapay is also set to launch a mobile app in September. Roger Gabriel, Bitinka’s founding partner, states that “The platform has a very important advantage that no other exchange on the planet offers: the possibility of buying bitcoins in your local currency… our users do not have to think about making international transfers to be able to recharge their balances in their respective accounts. Another important point to consider is our local presence, with offices and extensive integration with the most important banks in each of the countries where we operate, which not only provides us with a better response capacity, but also provides the security and confidence of operating with a local company that has the necessary structure to deal with any unforeseen events.” Roger Gabriel also highlighted the potential for Inkapay’s ease of use as a vehicle for sending remittances throughout the Americas.  The announcements come alongside Bitinka reporting significant growth in customer use during 2017. Bitinka says it has seen an average monthly growth of 44%, with the company anticipating further growth following the implementation of credit card integration and e-commerce API across Bitinka’s services.

2017-06-22T13:00:44-04:00,Mainstream Journalist Makes Bizarre Attempt at Living On Bitcoin for a Week,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/mainstream-journalist-makes-bizarre-attempt-at-living-for-a-week-using-bitcoin/,"CNBC journalist Seema Moody recently published a report detailing the trials and tribulations of her attempt to live for a week solely using bitcoin as currency. This report, and others like it, fail to represent the actual ease with which one can exclusively use bitcoin as a money commodity, and spreads myths about the impracticality of cryptocurrency as a mean of exchange. Also Read: State-Funded Bitcoin Data Center Infuriates Montana Locals
 Seema Moody’s report details her apparently arduous experience of attempting to live for a week solely using bitcoin as currency. The report opens with the Moody complaining that are no bars in New York that accept bitcoin, before moving to a montage of her dangling various items at several confused retailers whilst asking if she can purchase their products using bitcoin. Seema then purchases food from a couple of eateries, declaring the fees involved to add an additional 30 and 70 percent on top of the regular price. Transportation is presented as a challenge, but it is conceded that Uber credits can be purchased via a third party company using bitcoin.  As the week progresses Seema Moody starts to purchase gift cards online via bitcoin in order to make basic purchases, and finds someone on the internet who is willing to sell her a public transportation card in exchange for bitcoin. Moody ultimately concludes that bitcoin is a cumbersome and challenging medium of exchange that requires the constant seeking and interaction with third parties in order to facilitate basic purchases. It is determined that her week-long experiment incurred an additional expense of 40% percent when compared to cash. Seema is not the first journalist to document the supposed struggle of attempting to live exclusively using bitcoin as currency. Kashmir Hill produced a similar story for Forbes in May 2013, making the same conclusions pertaining to the hassles of obtaining basic staples such as food using bitcoin. The concept was again dredged up by CNN’s Morgan Spurlock in 2015, the year after the release of ‘Life on Bitcoin‘ – a documentary made by a honeymooning couple seeking to travel and live solely on bitcoin. Although seeing bewildered journalists stumbling through a city, accosting shop owners about technology they have not heard of may make for entertaining viewing, such creates an absurd myth pertaining to the challenges of using bitcoin in day-to-day life. Said ‘experiments’ conveniently forget to mention the existence of debit card providers such as Xapo, that allow you to pay for items from your bitcoin holdings using conventional card swipe and 3D Secure technology. If one chooses to use a product such as Xapo’s (or Coinbase’s similar debit card) the only barrier to them making purchases would be a business failing to provide eftpos facilities (the typical Visa/Mastercard point-of-sale solutions most modern stores host). The reporting in question also ignores the sole purpose of bitcoin ATM machines, which allow users to convert bitcoin holdings into cash in the absence of businesses that accept bitcoins. The use of services like those mentioned above would dramatically reduce the fees that Moody experienced. Reports like Moody’s choose to ignore these services, likely because watching a journalist walk around using an eftpos card at businesses and ATMs machines would not make for compelling viewing.  The report also fails to make mention of the hardship that many of the world’s underbanked struggle through in attempting to conduct basic purchases. The challenges of being able to access food and transport is a daily reality for the world’s 2 billion un- or underbanked citizens, with many being completely locked out of the global economy due to the corruption or absence of financial institutions. For many, the challenges of being unable to access services that Moody imposed on herself through not visiting bitcoin ATMs are an everyday consequence of being born into a society with a poorly developed banking system. The price volatility of bitcoin is also cited by Moody as a major barrier to widespread adoption as a means of exchange. Although recent price action shows an inarguable volatility, greater bitcoin adoption will over time have a stabilizing effect upon its price. The larger bitcoin user-base the more selling or buying pressure is required to move the price, and if bitcoin were to begin to see significant retail uptake, the constant trading of bitcoin created by merchants seeking to realize profit would increasingly tighten the range of bitcoin’s price swings. This type of stabilization will not occur tomorrow, but over a long period as cryptocurrency becomes increasingly embedded in society, just as the internet became increasingly embedded into the fabric of everyday life in a slow yet sustained fashion. The argument regarding bitcoin’s value ignores the millions of citizens who struggle to make basic purchases due to their national currencies suffering from hellish hyperinflation. The drastic and often daily losses of value seen by currencies such as Argentina’s, Venezuela’s and Zimbabwe’s in recent years make bitcoin’s price volatility appear tame by comparison With bitcoin continuing to generate attention from mainstream media outlets, it is unfortunately likely we will see more journalists bumbling through malls with a smartphone in hand, searching for bitcoin-accepting retailers in a bid to comically disprove the efficiency of bitcoin as a money commodity.

Also read: Korea Steadily Becoming a Cryptocurrency and Fintech Hub  South Korean financial regulators and government agencies have been watching and researching the use of digital currencies within the country. According to the publication, Business Korea, law enforcement officials such as the prosecutor’s office and the National Intelligence Service (NIS) are watching these markets closely.  Lately, both bitcoin and ethereum have been selling like hot cakes in Korea and for prices above the global average for both cryptocurrencies. For instance at the time of writing the global average for BTC is roughly $2684 but on the Korean exchange Korbit, one bitcoin is selling for over $3000. Government officials from the region believe the rising prices are based on mere speculation and are currently not considering digital currencies an investment. Moreover, authorities spoke harshly against ICO’s that have recently been gathering millions of dollars.  “The recent rise in cryptocurrency prices has taken on a speculation aspect.” explains a South Korean official. Furthermore, the country’s prosecutors have said there have been reports of a lot of fraudulent activities surrounding digital currencies. Some law enforcement officials want the state’s regulators to intervene the regional publication’s reporter Cho Jin-young detailed. Following the request, the Korean government has created a “task force” that includes members from the Bank of Korea, the Financial Supervisory Service (FSS), and the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Sources say the working group is pondering regulating cryptocurrencies but cannot come to an agreement on the best path forward. “Currently, every country has different points of view on virtual currencies, and there is no consensus across governments on directions,” details an FSC executive. Additionally, the report describes concerns for manipulated volumes from domestic exchanges. South Korea’s top exchanges in the region Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit have been trading large volumes of Korean Won-KRW/BTC daily. Volume-wise the top three bitcoin trading platforms in South Korea are surpassing many of the top exchanges worldwide.

Also Read: Global Bitcoin ATM Proliferation Nearly Doubled During May U.S. officials and blockchain company representatives held a subcommittee hearing on the implications of virtual currencies and illicit financing on June 8. Members of the blockchain subcommittee who testified at the congressional hearing include Jerry Brito (Coin Center), Scott Dueweke (Identity and Payments Association), Kathryn Haun (Stanford Law School), Jonathan Levin (Chainalysis), and Luke Wilson (Elliptic). Both Chainalysis and Elliptic are blockchain monitoring companies that are well known for helping law enforcement with digital currency surveillance. “This hearing will explore terrorists and illicit use of financial technology (FinTech), the national security implications of virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, and the use of “blockchain” technologies to record transactions and uncover illicit activities,” details the congressional memo.   During the discussion, U.S. Representative, Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, asked the blockchain monitoring company executives why they couldn’t locate the infamous missing Mt Gox coins supposedly lost in 2014. “I was particularly struck by your opening remarks that we can detect the activity,” explained Representative Davidson. “It seems that if we have this ability, which it seems we theoretically should, then we would be able to find the missing Mt. Gox coins. Why can’t we?” According to the Chainalysis co-founder Jonathan Levin, the company knows exactly where the missing 650,000 BTC are but doesn’t detail specific information during the hearing. “We actually did find those,” reveals Levin. Over the past few months, the U.S. government has been concerned with digital currencies promoting criminal activities. There have been many hearings and bills set forth to tighten regulatory policies and research cryptocurrencies and blockchain behavior. Both Chainalysis and Elliptic have signed partnership deals with law enforcement officials worldwide and claim to have forensic tools that can trace transactions to locations. Although Levin detailed “the destination of those coins is definitely known,” it doesn’t mean the missing coins can be accessed, and the Chainalysis co-founder has not responded to questions from the press.

Also Read: Global Bitcoin ATM Proliferation Nearly Doubled During May First Bitcoin Capital Corp have announced that they will be integrating check-cashing capabilities into high traffic ATM locations throughout Northern California in partnership with Simple Automated Money, Inc. BITCF is a publicly traded Canadian company that seeks to acquire bitcoin start-ups and invest in companies that are developing bitcoin software or hardware applications.  The partnership with SAMCO will begin with a trial of 3 check cashing kiosks in Northern California, before beginning a national rollout later this year. BITCF has also announced it has begun development for integrating bitcoin trading purchasing and selling capabilities throughout the current network of 85 SAMCO kiosks that are installed throughout America. BITCF has been distributing SAMCOs kiosks to medical cannabis dispensaries in California – an emerging market that BITCF seeks to capitalize upon. It has been quite a busy month for BITCF, with other announcements that the company will be launching an ICO for an alternative cryptocurrency called Weedcoin. Weedcoin is proposed as an alternative payment option for the burgeoning cannabis industry, however, just like its major rival Potcoin, Weedcoin appears to offer nothing unique to cryptocurrency outside of a niche-specific name for marketing purposes. BITCF also announced plans to move ownership of its shares onto the bitcoin blockchain following recommendations by the company’s SEC counsel due to the required disclosures to OTC Markets – where the company’s shares were previously traded.    The company also garnered attention in April when it was announced that BITCF-owned cryptocurrency exchange COINQX would be the first exchange to offer speculation on the possible outcomes of the hard fork. It was announced that COINQX will be offering five additional ‘futures’, allegedly corresponding to different potential outcomes of the hard fork. The company added the following disclaimer to the announcement of said ‘futures’ markets, stating “none of these “futures” tokens are backed by BTC nor are they securities, derivatives or futures contracts, yet, they are rather mere fiat cryptocurrencies designed to predict the future from their present popularity (and/or lack thereof)” – leaving many skeptical as to what the tokens represent.

Other investors that participated in the round include Nokota Management, Digital Currency Group, Lightspeed Venture Partners, Mosaic Ventures, Prudence Holdings, Virgin, and Sir Richard Branson. “Blockchain was one of the first digital currency wallets, quickly grew to market leadership, and has only extended its lead since then,” said investor and current board member, Jeremy Liew from Lightspeed Venture Partners. “Now that bitcoin and Blockchain have started to get broader traction, they are the best positioned to become the mainstream leaders.” This week Bitcoin.com chatted with Blockchain’s CEO and Co-Founder, Peter Smith who told us the new capital will be used for global expansion and improving localization efforts, as well as research and development of emerging digital assets. Furthermore, Smith gives our readers some insight into how his company initially started, its primary focus, and how the co-founder sees the cryptocurrency ecosystem today.         Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you give our readers a summary of how the Blockchain company was conceived? Peter Smith (PS): So Blockchain was originally a pretty simple idea. It was just the idea that you could make bitcoin easier to use for everyday people. From the very beginning, bitcoin was hard to use even if you were a developer. Controls were really bad, and the wallet software was hard to use, and we got a start on building software that made bitcoin easier and more approachable. BC: How would you compare the early days of your company compared to now with Bitcoin interest and price at all time highs? PS: I think the big difference is in the early days there weren’t that many users, and now there are millions of users. In the beginning, there were only a few of us working at Blockchain, and now there are about 50 people that work for the company. So there’s a lot more users and a lot more people working for the company, and that’s probably the biggest difference. What we come in and do every day is still basically the same. The last few weeks have been particularly busy because traffic is quite high across the whole ecosystem. But I think everybody in the digital currency space has been quite busy. BC: A lot of people use the blockchain explorer and comprehensive data your company provides. How popular are those feature services? PS: The blockchain explorer and charts and data from our site sees a couple of million unique active users regularly.   BC: Since the beginning of January have you guys seen a significant increase in wallet users? PS: I think the growth over the last six months has been particularly strong. Not just seeing this with people using our feature services but we’ve also seen a lot of market share appreciation which is great to see. I think the price is always exciting, but for us, we define how well we’re doing by how well we do through the normal periods rather than just the big run ups.

So for us what we focus on is seeking out very consistent growth.  BC: From your perspective at Blockchain do you see Bitcoin demand slowing down anytime soon? PS: Certainly, haven’t seen that happen yet. BC: What’s your overall opinion of the state of the network right now? PS: I think it’s clear that we need to scale the network. I’ve been very public about that, and how we should scale the network and of course Blockchain is a strong supporter of the New York agreement.

Also read: Washington State Bill to Ban Bitcoin for Pot Fails Singlepoint Inc. is a publicly traded holding company based in Phoenix, Arizona, that focuses on acquiring undervalued companies in emerging markets, including cannabis. On Tuesday, the company announced that it has closed a $1 million funding deal with an institutional investor. This funding will help close many acquisition deals which are already in the pipeline, according to CEO Greg Lambrecht, adding that “we have many technical developments that are ready to launch.” According to the announcement, several companies have already been acquired in the cannabis industry and discussions are underway with even more. In addition: The management believes that the capital raised will enable the company to “move very quickly to develop a cryptocurrency solution and continue acquisitions in the cannabis space.” The cannabis industry has been growing rapidly as the legal market expands in the U.S. and Canada. In 2016, North American marijuana sales grew by 30% to $6.7 billion, according to Arcview Market Research. However, cannabis business owners in states that have fully legalized marijuana still have difficulties accepting payments due to federal law prohibiting banks and credit unions from taking marijuana money. “In Colorado, everyone involved with the state’s legal cannabis industry has a banking problem. Businesses can’t get loans, customers have to pay in cash, and state tax collectors are processing bags of bills,” wrote The Pew Charitable Trusts last year. A number of these businesses subsequently turn to accepting bitcoin payments instead. In March, Bitcoin.com reported on fintech startup Posabit, which has been helping dispensaries in Seattle accept the digital currency. This followed the State of Washington giving marijuana dispensaries approval to accept bitcoin for cannabis sales. Payment platform Indospace has also been helping cannabis merchants accept bitcoin. Singlepoint provides payment products and services for the cannabis industry through its subsidiary, Singleseed. In January 2014, Singlepoint began working on a bitcoin payment solution. Since then, demand for bitcoin as well as its acceptance as a method of payment has grown significantly. The company noted: Singlepoint partnered with blockchain technology provider First Bitcoin Capital earlier this month to solve the payment problems in the cannabis industry using Bitcoin and blockchain technology. The pair will jointly “develop a proprietary solution specifically for high-risk payment verticals including the cannabis industry,” the company announced at the time, noting that this “will help solve the banking issue in the cannabis industry and other high-risk markets.” The two companies have planned four developments based on bitcoin, ethereum and blockchain technology. In addition, Singlepoint is also working on a potential Initial Coin Offering (ICO) that “would support transactions on the blockchain specifically for cannabis and other high-risk industries.” In Tuesday’s announcement, Singlepoint explained that it has been working on finding solutions for the cannabis industry for many years: The company is also planning to release a full-scale web development and online marketing solution for dispensaries. Some of the funding raised will be used for an online marketing system to drive customers to Singleseed, Tuesday’s announcement revealed.

They finally added the bitcoin symbol to their code. Now users can type the “B” symbol with their keyboards. The updated version has 8,518 new characters, with a total of 136,690. The Unicode site also mentions they have new scrips and emoji characters.  Also read: New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode with Stefan Thomas of Ripple Labs The site reads, “Unicode 10.0 adds 8,518 characters, for a total of 136,690 characters. These additions include 4 new scripts, for a total of 139 scripts, as well as 56 new emoji characters.” On the Unicode page, the website had bitcoin under a special section that read “important symbol additions.” People have trying to get the bitcoin symbol added to Unicode for years. Back in 2011, Sander Van Galoven attempted to get the bitcoin symbol accepted into the Unicode standard, but he proposition was rejected. More recently, in October 2015, Ken Shirriff submitted the classic “B” symbol with the two lines running through it. That is when the symbol was officially accepted. Kevin Helms writing for bitcoin.com covered this when it was announced: “Bitcoiner Ken Shirriff submitted the classic B symbol with two vertical lines through it as the Unicode symbol for the bitcoin currency and was told that it had been accepted. One month to the day after his submission, Adobe employee and Unicode representative Ken Lunde tweeted that Shirriff’s application had been accepted”  Even though the symbol was accepted, it was not in the 2016 code update. Some have been using the Thai baht ‘฿’ symbol, others the Ƀ symbol. Soon they should be able to use an official bitcoin symbol when providing descriptions of bitcoin prices online.

Also Read: State of Montana Funds Bitcoin Mine to Bolster Local Jobs The initial excitement that surrounded Montana Governor Steve Bullock’s announcement that over $416,00 USD would be distributed to Project Spokane, LLC, a data center that provides blockchain security services for the bitcoin network seems to have dissipated among locals of Bonner.  “It’s a horrendous noise,” Elaine Nagle, who lives near the site told local news outlet, The Missoulian. “We used to have hummingbirds all the time, and we don’t hardly have hummingbirds any more. We’re retired, and we just want to enjoy the years we have left. We can’t even sit outside on our deck anymore.” Despite local speculation that Project Spokane, LLC may be on its way to becoming the largest data center in North America, councilors have been inundated with complaints of a giant humming noise bellowing at all hours of the day. “It’s driving some people crazy,” stated County Commissioner Jean Curtiss. “It’s kind of like sitting on a tarmac when a jet engine is winding up to take off, but the plane never leaves. It’s like a loud hum.” Locals are now awaiting the findings of a sound engineer hired by the data center’s owners to assess the problem, with residents being told to expect that a report will be produced in a few weeks. Not everyone in Bonner is upset about the data center’s presence though. The superintendent of Bonner School District, Jim Howard, told the Missoulian that “his neighborhood’s had mill noise for a hundred years. I’m sure when it was going full steam some 25 years ago when I was around, it had to have been as noisy or noisier. Noise is evidence of productivity and good things happening here and we want to see that economic development. We’re glad to see good things happening at the mill site and we recognize it’s an industrial site and it’s going to have noise.”  The grant received by Project Spokane was issued on that basis that the company would create 65 new jobs in Bonner through an economic development program designed to reimburse companies brining money into the state from elsewhere within the country and create well-paying jobs locally. “The community is glad to have development occurring across here” Jim Howard continued. “Nobody in the school has complained. The first I heard there was an issue was when I saw the correspondence related to the community council meeting.” What do you think about the noise generated after Montana Government funded $416,000 towards the data center?

2017-06-21T12:00:26-04:00,Investment Legend Bill Miller Still Bullish on Bitcoin,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/investment-legend-bill-miller-still-bullish-on-bitcoin/,"In a recent interview with CNBC, investment legend Bill Miller described bitcoin as “a true disruptor and true innovation in money”. Also Read: Global Bitcoin ATM Proliferation Nearly Doubled During May Famed investor Bill Miller discussed his thoughts on bitcoin with CNBC this past week.  Miller revealed that he and his son are still highly bullish on bitcoin. Miller described bitcoin as a major technological disruptor, and a catalyst for fierce change within the domain of finance. “It is a true disruptor and true innovation in money,” Miller said. The investment legend has assessed bitcoin’s potential with a long-term perspective in mind. With regard to the scale of fiscal innovation and creative destruction that bitcoin may unleash upon traditional financial and monetary processes and technology, Miller described cryptocurrency as being a catalyst for economic disruption on a scale that “we haven’t seen… in thousands of years.” The 10-year chief investment officer of Legg Mason Capital Management has been outspoken in his belief in bitcoin since investing heavily following the collapse Mt. Gox in 2014. In a 2014 interview with CNBC, Miller blasted negative comments regarding bitcoin that had been made by Warren Buffet, describing Buffet as possessing a “logical flaw in his thinking, and emphasizing the growth potential of bitcoin should expansion in the cryptocurrencies userbase continue.” “If [bitcoin] becomes only 10 percent as popular as gold, then it’s an $800 billion market value. You can lose 100 percent of your money, or you can make 120 times your money. I think the risk reward is OK.”  The fixed supply of bitcoin has always been of appeal to Miller, prompting the investor to make numerous comparisons between bitcoin and gold. Miller has previously emphasized the historic fluctuations in gold’s price when discussing the volatility of bitcoin, suggesting that Miller is in no way deterred by bitcoin’s price movements, and see bitcoin as a legitimate contender for mainstream status in the not too distant future. Miller joins a long list of mainstream investors whose involvement with bitcoin has garnered the attention of mainstream financial press following the recent meteoric rise of bitcoin across 2017. Although all eyes are on bitcoin’s astounding gains right now, many investors like Miller were largely dismissed by the mainstream press when singing bitcoin’s praises during the post-China bubble downtrend.

Since then weâve had significant demand, with cloud mining contract sales consistently outpacing supply. Furthermore, we’ve also had a bunch of customers tell us the excellent results they’ve seen with our premiere cloud mining plans. Bitcoin.comâs new cloud mining service at pool.bitcoin.com has gone out of stock nearly every day since we publicly launched. More inventory has been added daily but continues to sell out within hours. Bitcoin.com developer Shaun Chong, says because we’ve offered some of the most affordable contracts in the industry, sales ranging from one month to lifetime contracts have sold much faster than expected. Â  âWe sell at a rate of up to $100,000 per hour after we add new inventory to the site. Lifetime contracts have been the most popular,â explains Mr. Chong. Since then we have re-stocked our contracts, and currently, we have over 50 PH/s ($6.45 million) worth of stock available. The cloud mining system developed by Shaun Chong and Emil Oldenburg, CTO of Bitcoin.com is sure to have a busy year with bitcoinâs growing popularity.
 Bitcoin.com cloud mining has partnered with the largest Bitcoin mining data center in North America to source hashrate at the best value. Upon visiting the partner data center, Bitcoin.com executives were amazed by the data center’s enormous physical and electrical scale, all contributing to the Bitcoin network.  Alongside the fast rate of cloud mining contract sales, we are pleasing customers. One satisfied customer told us about his return on investment (ROI) after purchasing a one month contract. âI made about +10% in BTC with my one-month contracts â Pretty good results, I am happy,â explains a contract holder. One user even created a cool tool that helps calculate ROI for every contract we offer. The same user who created the tool pulled in around 9.1 percent for his one month purchase. We are super thrilled to see these contracts sell out so fast and with the success stories, we have heard from satisfied customers since we started. We believe because pool.bitcoin.com is the highest paying mining pool in the world, it is poised to become a leader in the industry. âNow our cloud mining contracts allow anyone to mine in this challenging but lucrative industry,â Mr. Chong adds. Here at Bitcoin.com, weâre thrilled to offer a service where Bitcoin enthusiasts can participate in mining, and help secure the strongest digital currency network in the world.

Also read: New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode with Charlie Shrem and Anthony Di Iorio of Jaxx Currently, traditional settlement times for international bank transfers can cost a lot of money and days to complete the payment. Ripple Labs is positioning itself to help provide banks and large financial institutions save billions in fees and deliver significantly faster settlement times. The Ripple settlement system has been used by well-known institutions such as Santander, UBS, and Unicredit. The company claims to provide “secure, instant and nearly free global financial transactions of any size with no chargebacks.” Thomas believes 26 trillion dollars worldwide is held back due to regulatory hurdles, and insufficient transparency between banking partners causing a lack of trust. The Ripple protocol aims to improve the existing financial infrastructure. “Ripple works with banks to improve the financial infrastructure that [banks] use for cross-border payments,” explains Thomas during the podcast. Ripple believes their settlement system can provide a more efficient alternative to international banking protocols such as Swift and ACH transfers. Over the past year, there has been great interest in Ripple’s interbank transactions, and the protocol’s tokens have substantially increased in value over the previous five months. Thomas describes in great detail how he believes his company’s XRP token and IOU infrastructure can free up billions of dollars worldwide and ultimately change the traditional settlement system.

2017-06-21T10:00:18-04:00,PBOC Will Not Release Regulations for Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Anytime Soon,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/pboc-regulations-chinese-bitcoin-exchanges/,"Local Chinese publications reported last month that the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) will issue regulatory guidelines for Chinese bitcoin exchanges in June. However, last week, the bank reportedly dispelled the rumor and confirmed that no bitcoin regulations will be released this month. Also read: Regulations for Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Expected in June, Withdrawals Could Soon Follow In May, Caixin reported that the PBOC was expected to issue new regulatory guidelines for Chinese bitcoin exchanges in June. This would cover a list of requirements including anti-money laundering (AML) as well as how funds are managed. However, 8btc reported this week that Sun Hui, vice president of the PBOC Shanghai Head Office, revealed at the news conference held by the Information Office of Shanghai Municipal Government that: In addition, insiders at Huobi, Btcc, and Okcoin told the publication that they have not received any new regulatory documents. Following the PBOC’s inspection in January, the big three Chinese bitcoin exchanges halted coin withdrawals. Btcc, Huobi and Okcoin separately said at the time withdrawals would only resume after the regulators had approved their internal compliance upgrades. Several bitcoin exchanges in Beijing met with the PBOC on March 7 to discuss the details of the draft regulations for bitcoin exchanges, according to 8btc. The draft outlines requirements imposed on bitcoin exchanges such as to overhaul their know-your-customer (KYC) systems and to comply with AML and anti-terrorist financing policies. However, there has been no indication of when the PBOC’s regulatory guidelines will be released. Near the end of March, Bitcoin.com reported that the exchanges would not resume withdrawals until the PBOC’s AML rules had been clarified. However, at the end of May, the exchanges surprised the Bitcoin community by resuming withdrawals, with some restrictions. Nonetheless, Sun did not have a specific date for the release of the regulations to share at the press conference last week. Citing differences in bitcoin treatment in each country, he said: The PBOC defines bitcoin as a “virtual commodity” and not a “financial product”, Sun noted, adding that “the principle is that we will adopt applicable and appropriate regulations on bitcoin.” When do you think the PBOC will issue regulations for Chinese bitcoin exchanges?

2017-06-21T05:22:59-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin Price Climbs Higher After Last Week’s Low,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoin-price-climbs-higher/,"Since our last markets update bitcoin’s fiat value dipped 30 percent throughout the second week of June. Following the correction, the price of bitcoin started moving back up on June 16th taking 15 percent off the previous day’s downfall. The price has been moving up the ladder ever since and is testing the $2780 range at the time of writing.    Also Read: Forbes Encourages Readers to Buy Bitcoin at All-Time Highs Over the past few days, the price of bitcoin has once again started rallying after a steep dip down to the $2100 mark. Market volumes have been phenomenally strong with a massive $1.7 billion in daily trade volume. Bitcoin’s market dominance hit an all time low a few days ago touching 36 percent, but since the price has started ticking upwards, market dominance has also rebounded to 39 percent. As the price of BTC has been rising, this time around Ethereum isn’t following bitcoin’s lead and is currently down 5 percent.  On June 20th bitcoin’s value spiked quite a bit from the day prior’s $2575 price to a high of $2783. According to technical indicators, the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is now above the long-term 200 SMA, showing a bullish comeback. However, the gap between the two SMA levels is not as wide as the past run-ups in price. Stochastic shows we still may see some sell offs in the future, but the Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicates some solid buy pressure is currently in motion. Order books across a few popular exchanges are currently showing strong resistance above the $2900-3000 range. We skipped breaching a head and shoulders formation, and it seems we may be in the clear from a bearish downtrend for the time being. Overall markets have been a little more positive after the decline last week. Some bitcoin proponents have attributed the spike to the New York agreement which seems to be gaining some headway. On June 19th 70 percent of the network hashrate signaled their support for Segwit2x by placing “NYA” into their blocks. Although the compromise has seen a lot of support, it’s still not certain Segwit2x will activate in the future. On the flipside, mainstream media is still reporting on bitcoin markets and demand nearly every day. However, some news headlines have been a touch dreary with talks of increased regulatory action from governments all around the world adding a degree of uncertainty. At the moment bitcoin is grinding steadily upwards and slowly approaching the $2800 range. It’s entirely possible the price could test above $3000 this time around if enough steam and buy pressure is built up. For now, it looks like there is substantial support between the $2500-2600 territory. If the price follows the consistent pattern, like it has over the past few months retracing back 20-30 percent, and followed by a higher run-up in price, the value may exceed the last all-time high in the near future. Bear Scenario: If the price breaks current support we could see a drop back into the $2500-2600 range. At the moment there is significant consolidation happening, but things could shift at any time. The price is still volatile and should make for some good profits for intra-range players. Stochastic trends continue to indicate the price may be in a overbought zone which could lead to some bearish slide backs. Bull Scenario: Bitcoin’s price has come very close to reaching $2800 on June 20th. Bulls are charging, and the buyer’s market looks like it should continue in the short term. It’s going to take some hefty buy pressure to surpass the $3000 sell walls, but at current momentum, it still seems very possible. The 100 SMA and longer term 200 SMA gap continue to widen showing dynamic buy pressure will continue over the next 12 hours.     What do you think about the price of bitcoin right now?

Also Read: HYCM Offer Bitcoin-USD Pairing Ayondo has become the latest notable CFD broker to announce that it will offer Bitcoin trading. Ayondo provides the financial services industry with social trading and brokerage services and technology for both business-to-consumer and business-to-business CFDs, and is part of Ayondo Holding AG which domiciled in Zug, Switzerland. The company was founded in 2008.  The company will be introducing BTC pairings via Ayondo Holding Ag’s trading platform, which facilitates the trade of a range of financial instruments including indices, commodities, and interest rates. Bitcoin trading will also be made available on Wetrade, Ayondo’s social trading platform, which provides a social media styled trading platform in which users can discuss stocks with one another, publish technical analysis, and follow other traders. Ayondo’s decision to integrate bitcoin trading into its social trading platforms comprises an attempt to capture a larger market share than its competitors through building a community around its cryptocurrency pairings. With bitcoin’s hype reaching its historic peak in recent months, a flood of new investors have entered the markets, many of whom have no previous experience with the financial markets. Being able to garner the loyalty of new users could give the company a significant advantage over its competitors, as successful new traders will be likely to trade other financial products offered by Ayondo.  Although the recent proliferation of CFD brokers moving to offer bitcoin pairings will expose new audiences to bitcoin’s profit potential, the cryptocurrency community must be cautious in welcoming a greater presence from conventional CFD brokers. Trading bitcoin via derivative markets such divorces the cryptocurrency from its underlying use-values. The benefits of fluid, frictionless circulation of capital, complete financial autonomy and the neutralization of counterparty risk are all negated by trading an abstract expression of bitcoin’s exchange-value as opposed to bitcoin itself. The mainstream financial markets will be more than happy to profit from traders who do not possess the patience for learning the technical basics required to safely store and manage one’s bitcoin autonomously.

2017-06-21T01:00:11-04:00,Indian Government to Monitor Bitcoin Before Deciding If Regulator Is Needed,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/indian-government-to-monitor-bitcoin-before-deciding-if-regulator-is-needed/,"Representatives of various Indian government departments have made statement regarding the Indian government’s inquiry into virtual currencies. The statements clarify that Indian officials will first monitor cryptocurrency before determining if regulators are needed, and elude to the possibility that bitcoin may be recognized as a form of payment. Also Read: India Cracks Down on Illegal Bitcoin Activities While Considering Regulations A committee that includes representatives from India’s finance ministry, the State Bank of India, the ministry of information technology, and the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) have discussed the report that it is completing on virtual currencies with Moneycontrol News.  “We have had five meetings and have consulted all ministries, public, stakeholders. We will submit the report by July-end,” a senior government official told Moneycontrol. In addition to examining the prevention of money laundering and the implementation of consumer protection with regards to cryptocurrency, the committee has been tasked with assessing the viability of regulating virtual currencies, with emphasis on greater accountability for cryptocurrency transactions. The committee has also recognized that a ban on virtual currencies may impossible to enforce. One official alluded to the possibility that the Indian government may consider recognizing bitcoin transactions as a legitimate means of payment. “SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) can be asked to regulate virtual currencies as transactions are currently done through unregulated exchanges. RBI may step in if the government plans to regulate them or accept them as currency.” India presently does not have a regulatory framework pertaining to the use of cryptocurrencies and does not wish to rush into the implementation of a juridical apparatus for virtual currencies. “We may monitor these currencies for some time and then see how it progresses. It can then be concluded if at all there is a need for a regulator,” the official said. The absence of current a legal classification pertaining to virtual currencies will likely extend the time for India to develop a comprehensive regulatory framework.  The committee’s statements contrast heavily from previous comments issued by the RBI regarding bitcoin and other virtual currencies. The RBI and other government departments have consistently warned citizens against the potential perils associated with cryptocurrency such as hacking and fraud, and have connotated its use with illegal activities in previous years. Although the Indian government is still a long way from embracing cryptocurrency technology, these statements show that the government’s stance regarding virtual currencies is maturing and evolving. Ultimately, the statements suggest that the bitcoin community can expect a nuanced, cautious, and sensible path toward cryptocurrency regulation in India.

2017-06-20T22:00:42-04:00,How to Piggy Bank Bitcoin Keys in a Cold Storage Mosaic Artwork,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-piggy-bank-bitcoin-keys-in-a-cold-storage-mosaic-artwork/,"Just recently Bitcoin.com chatted with Max Hampton-Fischer, an industrial design student at the Rhode Island School of Design to talk about his new physical bitcoin creation. Fischer has created a piece of artwork that also safely stores bitcoin keys in what he calls the ‘Bitcoin Cold Storage Mosaic.’ Also read: State of Montana Funds Bitcoin Mine to Bolster Local Jobs The cold storage mosaic is a group of large tiles glued to two pieces of 1/4“ plywood that contain a bitcoin public and private key pair. Fischer describes his work as a “sort of bitcoin ‘piggy bank’ that can only be ‘cashed out’ if it is destroyed.” The design student will soon be releasing a full-length video of the process but discussed his project and videos in detail with Bitcoin.com      Bitcoin.com (BC): What got you into bitcoin and tethering it with design? Max Hampton-Fischer (MHF): I’ve been interested in Bitcoin since the summer of 2015. Bitcoin is an incredible technology. I’m fascinated by the idea of concealment, privacy, assets, and money. In the 21st century, exposure is value, but with bitcoin exposure is only good if it’s the correct data. I want to create beautiful pieces of art that have material value (bitcoin) that people can put in their homes or collections without having to go through the trouble of using the complicated storing methods. BC: How did you come up with the idea for your Mosaic cold storage artwork? MHF: Obviously this can be easily seen as art, but I would consider myself a designer. Last summer my close friend Cole Jorissen and I started discussing many of these ideas surrounding bitcoin and its physicality. It’s incredible how physical it really is considering it’s the first digital currency. You know this if you’ve ever ASIC mined or had to use hardware and paper wallets. BC: Can you tell our readers how you made the Bitcoin Cold Storage Mosaic? MHF: The addresses are calculated from an offline device that is later destroyed. I glued the contents of the public and private key onto two 1/4″ pieces of plywood. Then, after completing both keys, the private key is glued by its border to the back of the public key face first; thus making it impossible to see. The private key creation is not included in my videos – in fact, all digital input including phone/ laptop cameras and microphones are physically tapped. To those who are familiar with bitcoin, the microphone might be excessive, but mapping hand movements with sound is a possible thing, and my device has to be perfect. There are few security measures for the private key. One of my biggest worries was that someone might be able to scan through it with an x-ray – so each tile is exactly the same density – each tile has both colors of paint layered on its surface and the only difference is what color is before the other. This makes differentiating the two with a powerful X-ray almost impossible as you would have to find minute density shifts inside, within the size of a hair – and scan through the sheets of metal that are sandwiched between the two. BC: When did you start making your videos and projects that are focused on bitcoin? MHF: I bought my first camera when I was quite young. I’ve been making Youtube videos since 2007. My first experimentation in this area was with Coin Flakes; an appropriation of Corn Flakes with private keys inside containing a random amount of bitcoin.

2017-06-20T19:00:13-04:00,Forbes Encourages Readers to Buy Bitcoin at All-Time Highs,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/forbes-encourages-readers-to-buy-bitcoin-at-all-time-highs/,"An article posted in Forbes’ Level-Up encouraged its readers to buy into bitcoin, despite bitcoin’s price currently sitting within range of its all-time high, following gains of several hundreds of percent over the course of the preceding year. The Forbes owned magazine’s article highlights a consistent pattern among mainstream media outlets’ coverage of cryptocurrency, in which cryptocurrency is sidelined and ignored whilst its price is low, before news organizations rally hype for bitcoin investment after meteoric price gains have already been made. Also Read: News Outlets and Journalists Are Being Threatened By Onecoin Lawyers Throughout the nascent years of cryptocurrency bitcoin received scant coverage in the press, with the exception of few niche technology publications. For several years bitcoin evaded extensive coverage in the mainstream press, until the darknet hosted anonymous free-market The Silk Road began to garner attention for facilitating the sale of illegal narcotics using bitcoin as its currency. A spattering of news outlets speculated about the potential for bitcoin’s use a vehicle for money laundering, terrorist financing and narcotics sales. Soon after, however, bitcoin stunned the world with meteoric price gains after unusually harsh austerity measures were being forced upon the nation of Cyprus during 2014. A resulting flood of citizens seeking to convert their savings into any store of value that could evade government seizure drove bitcoin prices from $40 USD to $260 USD.  The rest of 2013 saw many obituaries for bitcoin published by mainstream news outlets, before bitcoin again shocked the world be rallying past $1000 USD following a sudden flood of Chinese entrants into the cryptocurrency markets. The subsequent popping of the China bubble saw a slow year-long grind back to sub-$200 USD prices, seeing the majority of mainstream media publications dismiss the bitcoin bubble as a digital contemporary ‘Tulip Mania’ that would never be heard from again. The tendency for mainstream news outlets to dismiss bitcoin while its price is low before hyping cryptocurrency after it has boomed has become routine since the 2013 China bubble. The article published by Forbes in Level-Up in recent days titled ‘How To Buy Bitcoin, Now That It’s Reached An All-Time High’ echoes this familiar sentiment. The opening paragraph states that “the price for one coin has spiked to about $2,900. If you haven’t already, now is the time to buy in”. The area of $2,900 turned out to be a local top, with USD prices on Bitstamp forging a new all-time high of $2980, before a dramatic retracement that saw the largest 4-day loss of dollar-value in bitcoin’s history to retest $2100 USD. The price has partially recovered back to approximately $2600, leaving readers of Level-Up who may have purchased above $2900 holding position losses of over 10%, assuming that they resisted panic selling at prices closer to $2100.  This type of reporting has a dramatic effect on the bitcoin markets. Floods of new investors often rush into the cryptocurrency markets after seeing waves of positive mainstream press coverage. This glut of new investment typically drives prices parabolic, creating unsustainable price gains and triggering the very volatility that the mainstream press cites in rejecting bitcoin’s practical use as a currency. Once gravity catches up to the price parabola, the press quickly changes its tone and returns to forecasting the inevitability of bitcoin’s demise. This reporting destabilizes the cryptocurrency markets and places new investors at risk, as many new cryptocurrency participants have no prior experience with trading in the financial markets. New investors must recognize the flippancy of cryptocurrency reporting in mainstream media and avoid looking to such as a source of financial advice. Many publications cover bitcoin in order to capitalize on the spikes in cryptocurrency-related search engine queries that are typically produced by major news events or price actions within the cryptocurrency markets. The result is often poorly researched, hastily produced clickbait authored by journalists with little or no long-term experience with financial markets or cryptocurrency. Using this form of journalism as a source of investment advice is very risky, and new participants in the bitcoin markets should seek education from a variety of sources that have a demonstrated history of accurate reporting the cryptocurrency industries.

Chris Woolard, The Financial Conduct Authority’s executive director of strategy and competition, said there are many trades happening in the cryptocurrency and bitcoin space. He just wants investors to know there are risks with speculating in digital assets, that people could lose a lot of money.  Also read: 70 Percent of the Bitcoin Hashrate Begins Signaling Segwit2x A Financial London News article elaborated on Woolard’s considerations, saying, “Digital currencies are volatile. Bitcoin hit an all-time high of almost $3,000 this month, with some analysts saying its value could continue to soar. But in June last year, bitcoin was worth less than a third of this figure.” The article continued by claiming Woolard just wants to shield people, because they may believe digital assets are protected financial instruments, when they are not. Apparently, this announcement from Woolard and the Financial Conduct Authority came right after Hargreaves Lansdown launched two exchange-traded notes. The notes provide a way for investors to keep a bead on bitcoin’s price, but it does not appear to allow for trading options. Even though the supermarket Hargreaves Lansdown has not currently listed options for bitcoin, Woolard and the Financial Conduct Authority does not harbor negative attitudes toward cryptocurrencies. They do not want to outright ban them or make hasty decisions. They just want people to know these digital assets could be a volatile and untrustworthy investment. Woolard said: The regulator has concerns about blockchain technology and cryptocurrency, but he is going easy on them compared to other regulators. For instance, Australia’s Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, wants to regulate bitcoin and cryptocurrency out of existence because it allegedly fuels terrorism. The United States also has hamstringing legislation in the works, meant to cripple people’s use of bitcoin. This is reflected in senate bill 1241, which may expect citizens crossing borders to declare digital assets over 10k, among other, more authoritarian clauses. These kinds of regulatory initiatives may or may not come as a shock to the bitcoin community, but the fact regulators are becoming more interested in cryptocurrencies should be noted. As soon as Japan made bitcoin an accepted currency, and the price surged, regulators began to wake up. Now they are shooting from the hip with commentary, considerations, advice, and plans to regulate and control cryptocurrencies. It cannot be known how these attempts to control bitcoin and other digital assets will pan out, but it is certainly true time is changing in regards to how society-at-large will try to manage the newly emerging cryptoeconomy. Do you think regulations will negatively impact bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies? Will regulators ultimately fail? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-06-20T14:00:44-04:00,China Blames Bitcoin Transactions for Leading to More Synthetic Drug Deaths,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/china-blames-bitcoin-transactions-for-leading-to-more-synthetic-drug-deaths/,"China is expected to ban a new synthetic heroin substance called U-47700, and they blame bitcoin as the currency “criminals” use to conduct transactions with their customers. They tend to think anonymous bitcoin trades on the dark web lead to people’s deaths at the hands of these synthetics. Also read: HYCM Offers Bitcoin-USD Pairing A June 19th article by ABC News read, The drug in question is a heroin-style substance that Chinese authorities cannot seem to get a grip on. The article suggested that chemists constantly change the chemistry of the chemicals, which makes them technically legal. Then, using the dark web, drug dealers do cryptocurrency trades with Americans that lead to the deaths. This news comes as recent research on dark web market activity has allegedly intensified. According to a bitcoin.com article written by Samuel Haig, research by the Global Drug Survey has indicated growth in dark web purchase numbers. Haig said, “European nations see the highest adoption of darknet markets among drug users. Finland showed the greatest uptake of dark market adoption, with 41 percent of Finnish drug users reporting that they had purchased narcotics using the dark web. Denmark came second, 27.2 percent, followed by The United Kingdom (25.3 percent), Wales (25 percent), Sweden (24.5 percent), and Scotland & Spain (22.5 percent).” Interestingly, China’s/Asia’s numbers do not match the significance of the European use of the dark web to secure drugs. Still, governments are viewing digital currency transfers used in drug exchanges as more and more of a threat. It is true that law enforcement officials and agents have known digital currencies are a big aspect of the dark web…but now it appears they are wanting to blame synthetic heroin deaths strictly on bitcoin darknet transactions from Chinese merchants. Adding insult to injury, there have been a flurry of threats to regulate and ban and control bitcoin. Some countries have already outright banned it (Ecuador) or have initiated strict restrictions (China). Therefore, with more condemnations of drug trades using the currency, it is possible that regulators will be further galvanized to lead an assault on bitcoin and dark web cryptocurrency trades. Nonetheless, cryptocurrency market capitalization continue to soar, dark webs continue to proliferate, and more people continue to adopt the currencies. In Ecuador, regulators have not been able to stop the currency’s growth, and in China dark web transactions are still in full swing. No telling how politicians will decide to handle the ensuing growth of the crypto darknet marketplaces. Do you think government intervention will affect the use of bitcoin?

2017-06-20T11:30:43-04:00,Most Popular Contactless Smart Cards in Japan Adding Bitcoin Hardware Wallets,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/contactless-smart-card-system-japan-bitcoin-hardware-wallets/,"Sony’s Felica technology is behind many of the most popular contactless NFC smart cards. Already the de facto standard in Japan for commuter travel payments, Felica is being used at the point of sale, railway and air ticketing, as well as for University ID cards – to name a few. It was recently announced that bitcoin has been successfully integrated with Felica technology. Plans have been announced for each contactless smart card to include a bitcoin wallet that holds a private key on the card. Also read: Bitcoin to Be Accepted at 260,000 Stores in Japan by This Summer Japanese electronics and entertainment megacorp Sony Corporation originally developed Felica contactless RFID-based smart card technology. In 2007, a company called Felica Pocket Marketing Inc. was founded to sell, promote and distribute Felica contactless cards as well as leasing card terminals to member companies. Built into smart cards, smartphones, and other devices, Felica technology is behind many of Asia’s mass transit systems and can be used as e-money, e-ID, e-tickets, and membership cards. For example, the technology is in use by both of Japan’s largest airlines, All Nippon Airways (ANA) for its Skip Service, and competitor Japan Airlines (JAL) for its Touch and Go service. It is also used in ID cards at more than 365 universities in the United States. In 2016, Nikkei Asian Review reported that the global shipments of Felica chips were expected to top 1 billion that year. Last week, Felica Marketing announced that it has developed and successfully tested a near-instant, “tap-to-pay” method for using cryptocurrencies with their contactless technology. Their tests focused on the technology’s usability, safety, and prevention of double spending. At the conclusion, the company reported that the tests were successful and that bitcoin integration made for a safe and practical payment system. Additionally, the company claims to be able to produce a product that can process a bitcoin payment very quickly, similar to their current tap-to-pay options. The company plans to add bitcoin hardware wallet functionality to each Felica card by adding a second memory storage chip to it. The existing memory chip is a “non-private memory region” that will continue to hold addresses and other information meant to be shared. Meanwhile, the new “private memory region”, called the Felica Pocket Region, was created to store the private key of a bitcoin wallet. It also makes signing each transaction more secure by isolating the private key and signature logic in tamper-resistant area. The wallet’s private key is accessed with a tap of the card onto a reader to sign each Bitcoin transaction, according to the company. In effect, future Felica-enabled cards and devices could be used as convenient hardware wallets like the Ledger, Trezor, and Keepkey. The biggest challenge integrating bitcoin to their cards was security, Felica Marketing revealed. Since the private key will be given to the payment applications, the payment apps and their providers need to be verified, although the company did not say how. The wait time for network confirmations recommended for securing bitcoin payments is the biggest issue for retail stores when accepting bitcoin, according to Felica. Asking customers to wait in the store for multiple network confirmations has long been a problem for Bitcoin merchant acceptance. The company, therefore, uses a centralized system to confirm all transaction before broadcasting them. The end result is a centralized payment layer on top of a decentralized settlement system, which offers Felica users an instant payment in bitcoin. Felica Marketing reported that the test proved that cryptocurrency payments work well with their tap-to-pay feature, while preventing double spending. Security considerations are the company’s top priority to be improved upon, specifically how to best secure the private keys, the company conveyed. Without giving a specific date, the company announced their plans to launch multiple hardware wallets with their partner companies. They also plan to offer support services for retailers accepting bitcoin payments using Felica. What do you think about Felica hardware bitcoin wallets? Let us know in the comments section below.

Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release. Imagine if you had invested in Bitcoin in 2012. Just five years ago, the price of Bitcoin was $10.50. Today, it’s worth $2600. A small $10,000 investment would have turned into $2.5 Million dollars today. That’s probably more than what you made throughout working your whole life. The same story is true with Ethereum. In 2014, prices were as low as $0.40 per Ether. Today, it is worth $350. A small investment would’ve also made you a millionaire. Now, you can’t go back and buy Bitcoin in 2012, or Ethereum in 2014. But you can look at the pattern and look at the patterns to see what works. There are hundreds of crypto projects with the same massive gains. There are patterns. We’d be stupid not to notice by now. Clearly, the key is to buy into promising promising, innovative, popular projects early before they go mainstream. Mobile Market
The mobile market is growing huge. More than half of all internet traffic goes through mobile devices. There are already billions of dollars being generated through silly mobile games like Flappy Bird. Yet, there are almost no serious cryptocurrency projects being produced on top of mobile platforms. Obviously, mobile is the next big market for crypto. Secret Weapon
iDice is an up and coming casino project built on top of the Ethereum project. They’re fast growing, and have the stats to back it up too. Over $422,000 worth of winnings have been paid out already. Did we mention this is only in their first two months? In fact, this makes them more popular than their competitors who have started their projects nearly a year in advance. iDice looks unstoppable. But what’s their secret weapon? iDice has been developing on their mobile app, which will be the first in the world for cryptocurrency. While they’re already ahead of their competitors, mobile will be the first step to monopolizing the blockchain gambling industry for iDice. Being the first to come into the mobile sector will allow iDice to dominate its competition. Investing in iDice iDice is currently holding a crowdsale, meaning anyone with cryptocurrency can invest into their platform. Returns on similar projects in the past have ranged from 10x to 30x their initial investment, and iDice will likely be no different. To participate, check out the crowdsale here: https://crowdsale.idice.io. iDice is currently issuing users tokens in exchange for their contributions, which can be used to redeem house profits. As well, iDice tokens will be tradeable on exchanges. This means you can sell tokens for a profit after the ICO. Press contact name

2017-06-20T06:00:23-04:00,Assisting in Bitcoin Purchases for Ransomware May Be Illegal in the US,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/assisting-in-bitcoin-purchases-for-ransomware-may-be-illegal-in-the-us/,"‘White hat’ security consultant, Vinny Troia, had his Coinbase account suspended for breaching US regulations by paying cyber-ransoms, amidst growing concerns that US anti-money laundering legislation needs to be updated for the cryptocurrency era.
 Also Read: US Lawmakers Urged to Take Action Against Unlicensed Offshore Bitcoin Exchanges Night Lion Security employee Vinny Troia was recently contacted and questioned about the purpose of his account with Coinbase. Troia’s employment sometime required him to pay ransoms on behalf of clients who had been the victim of ransomware attacks such as Wannacry – which recently had a severe impact upon businesses and institutions across the globe.  When Troia was unable to provide U.S. Department of Justice authorization for his activities, Coinbase suspended his account. Troia attempted to open new accounts under the identities of family members, which were also quickly shut down. The suspension was due to Troia sending of funds to a malicious illegitimate entity – which is considered to be in violations of Coinbase policies intended to ensure anti-money laundering and other anti-criminal regulations. In another example, a superseding indictment filed in December 2016 charged the owner of Coin.mx for violating federal anti-money law, with prosecutors stating that the defendant “knowingly processed and profited from numerous Bitcoin transactions conducted on behalf of victims of ransomware schemes.” The case satisfied 18 U.S.C 1960’s prohibition against the “transmission of funds that are known to the defendant to have been derived from a criminal offense or are intended to be used to promote or support unlawful activity[.]” Although the defendant pleaded guilty to a number of the charges laid against him, the case saw the defendant charged for providing assistance to victims of ransomware in accessing bitcoins – which violated legislation from 1960.  Instances such as this illustrate that lawmakers have failed to take into account the changing internet landscape borne of cryptocurrencies, and highlights the need for legislation that is adaptive to the changing landscape of the industries that embrace cryptocurrency  – including cybercrime. Fortunately, the FBI has issued statements that recognize that “businesses… [may be] faced with an inability to function” in the event of a ransomware attack, suggesting that businesses choosing to do so will not be punished. The fate of the exchanges that facilitate the purchasing of bitcoin for such ends is far less clear, signaling the drastic need for regulators to adapt legislation to the changing practices of both legitimate and illegitimate actors within the cryptocurrency economy.

Bitcoin.com talked with India’s leading bitcoin exchanges to find out what to really expect from the meeting. Also read: India’s Government Divided Over Bitcoin Legalization According to Dna, India’s English broadcast daily owned by Diligent Media Corporation, the Indian government is expected to make a decision about the regulatory framework of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies next week. However, no additional detail about the framework or the decision was given. “The issue of whether virtual currencies or bitcoins should be banned, regulated or self-regulated has been deliberated for some time,” the publication wrote. In order to further deliberate on the framework of cryptocurrencies in the country, the finance ministry has called for a meeting of all key officials. The meeting was supposed to take place on Monday but has been postponed to next week. It will be attended by Niti Aayog vice chairman Arvind Panagariya, Reserve Bank of India (RBI) governor Urijit Patel, Securities and Exchange Board of India chairman Ajay Tyagi and other key officials, Dna reported. In April, the government formed a committee to investigate Bitcoin and expects its report next month. The committee is also tasked with assessing the existing legal and regulatory framework of digital currencies in India as well as globally. Last month the government sought public comments on the Mygov website about whether digital currencies should be regulated. The deadline for the comments was on May 30. However, some continued to roll in even after the deadline. A total of 3,889 comments are showing on the website at press time. Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO and co-founder of a leading bitcoin exchange in India, Unocoin, told Bitcoin.com: He added that “this won’t be a decision as such, but a recommendation, based on what has been told to us in the closed-door meeting.” “A lot of government departments and other regulators are still warming up to bitcoin,” he said, noting that the committee “sought comments from us in a closed-door meeting” prior to seeking the public’s opinion. Meanwhile, the RBI “has taken a wait and watch policy as a stance,” Vishwanath conveyed, even though the bank has issued a couple of public warnings against digital currencies. Co-founder of the leading Indian bitcoin exchange Zebpay, Sandeep Goenka, concurs about the government’s next step.

The decision comes during a period of increased cryptocurrency engagement on the part of major financial institutions. Also Read: Coincheck Reopens Lending Service with 11 More Cryptocurrencies HYCM is a popular forex and CFDs trading broker that offers products to retail and institutional investors. The firm is part of the Henyep Capital Markets Group, an international corporation that has offices in the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, Cyprus, and Dubai. The group is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, Dubai Financial Service Authority, and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission.  The interest that HYCM is taking in bitcoin trading is yet another example of mainstream financial institutions attempting to cash in on bitcoin’s meteoric rise. The embedding of cryptocurrency into the mainstream world of financial technology is not playing out as many cryptocurrency pundits expected during bitcoin’s infancy. The recent slew of national governments announcing their experimentation with blockchain is a far cry to the utopian proposals of bitcoin and cryptocurrency governance that once flooded the bitcoin forums.  It would appear that Russia, China, Singapore, among other nations, are seeking to develop distributed ledgers through which to issue national currencies. Said projects appear to have all of the transparency of bitcoin, and none of the centralization – signposting that governments are seeking to utilize cryptocurrency technology to create the most invasive and privacy-eroding money commodity in history. With the example of Singapore, business heavyweights Deloitte have partnered with the government, comprising a likely example of how the contemporary state-finance nexus may seek to manifest within the cryptocurrency sphere.  Mainstream financial institutions such as HYCM offering bitcoin-based products may appear beneficial to the cryptocurrency community at first glance, as successful financial institutions entering bitcoin will expose cryptocurrency to new audiences. The risk, however, is that the underground cryptocurrency community may have persevered the trials and tribulations of bitcoin’s development, only for the technology to get handed on a platter to the financial industry to profit – reinforcing the dominance of the financial oligarchy that bitcoin originally sought to undermine.

2017-06-19T15:00:50-04:00,Malaysian Bitcoin Users Divest Carefully Into LTC and ETH,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/malaysian-bitcoin-users-divest-carefully-into-ltc-and-eth/,"Luno has published results of a survey conducted from its Malaysian userbase. The findings yield fascinating insights into the development and psychology of the Malaysian cryptocurrency community. Also Read: Malaysia Bitcoin Trading Volumes Rise as Capital Controls Tighten A recent survey conducted by Luno provides a fascinating insight into the development, motivations, investment style, and trading psychology of the Malaysian bitcoin community.  Approximately 60% of survey respondents described their engagement with cryptocurrency as being financially motivated. 15% described their bitcoin activities as conducting trading/speculation, whereas nearly 45% of users describe such as a long-term investment. The remaining 40% of survey respondents cited practical use-values like financial autonomy and fast, fluid payments as their principal use of bitcoin – a common finding among nations with an authoritative governing style.   The survey illustrated tentative uptake of alternative cryptocurrency adoption on the part of Malaysian bitcoin users. 52.6% of respondents have solely purchased bitcoin, with 47.4% reporting that they have purchased cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin. The most popular altcoin in Malaysia is Ethereum, with 56.4% of survey respondents stating that they have purchased ETH tokens. The second most popular altcoin market among Malaysia is Litecoin, with 7.4% of survey respondents reporting having purchased LTC tokens. This apparent hesitation on the part of the Malaysian cryptocurrency community to enter alternative cryptocurrency markets may signify that the more technical applications of newer altcoin projects are not as suited to the needs of the Malaysian economy.  Nearly 20% percent of survey respondents said that they do not trust bitcoin as an investment tool, and a further 31.4% percent of respondents said that they were yet to form an opinion. With just under half of respondents saying that they trust bitcoin, yet 60% of respondents being financially involved with bitcoin, it is clear that Malaysia’s bitcoin community is still underdeveloped, and likely heavily comprised of people casually experimenting with the technology. For the Malaysian cryptocurrency community, much of the attraction to bitcoin may simply be the poor performance of their national currency. Many Malaysians are likely simply looking for an alternative store of value to the Malaysian ringgit – which recently has seen 18 years lows when valued against the US dollar.

2017-06-19T12:37:54-04:00,70 Percent of the Bitcoin Hashrate Begins Signaling Segwit2x,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/70-percent-bitcoin-hashrate-signaling-segwit2x/,"On June 16 the alpha code for the scaling solution Segwit2x was released to the public following a large number of mining pools having vocally supported the plan. Since then a large majority of miners who back the Segwit2x roadmap have started signaling with their hashrate. Also Read: Australian Opposition Leader Believes Bitcoin is Fueling Terrorism    Over the past few weeks, the topic of scaling the Bitcoin network and the recent Segwit2x plan has been a hot subject amongst bitcoiners. A few days ago Bitcoin.com reported on the many Chinese mining companies who have agreed to back the Segwit2x protocol. Alongside this, the Digital Currency Group’s Barry Silbert who organized the New York agreement has been sharing information on the progress every day via Twitter. On June 18 the mining pool Bitfury began signaling for the New York agreement by using the call letters “NYA” in its mined blocks. The very next day a large majority of miners have also started showing support for the Segwit2x plan. As of right now, mining pools who support the agreement by signaling NYA in their blocks are Antpool, Bitcoin.com, Bixin, BTC.com, BTC.top, F2pool, Viabtc, and 1hash. The amount of support for the Segwit2x agreement is close to 70 percent of the network hashrate. The Segwit2x idea was first introduced by Rootstock’s Chief Scientist, Sergio Demian Lerner. Since then many miners and businesses within the bitcoin industry signed a pact during the Consensus conference in New York last month. The code itself is being worked on by a Segwit2x working group with Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik leading the way. Since the alpha code has been launched mining pools are now signaling their support for the protocol implementation. A recent Reddit public service announcement (PSA) that details how Segwit2x will actually work gives a great explanation of the entire process. Essentially if enough hashrate continues to support Segwit2x and reaches 80 percent over a 336 block signaling period that will lock in Segregated Witness. The protocol will then activate after another 336 blocks later for those running Segwit2x implementations. The Reddit thread also explains how the following hard fork (HF) after Segwit will be implemented on the main network. Bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik also adds his two cents to the PSA.    “Very close on 2M HF activation,” explains Garzik. “The prediction is that miners activate rapidly. Therefore, block 485218 (BIP102_FORK_MIN_HEIGHT) becomes the hard fork point. “+3 months” is the fallback safety measure, in case activation is slower than predicted.” On forums and social media, there are quite a bit of people within the bitcoin community on both sides of the debate who agree with the Segwit2x plan. On the other hand, there are also those who vehemently disagree with the idea of this type of compromise. However it seems a vast majority of mining pools, and many bitcoin-centric businesses are moving forward with Segwit2x despite forum commentary. The protocol is nearly identical to Core’s 0.14.1 client with some minor changes for signaling Segwit2x and the following activation of a soft fork and hard fork across the network. If consensus is reached, block size results would be roughly around 4MB as opposed to 1MB and will hopefully process 8,000 to 10,000 transactions per block. It will be interesting to see the outcome of the New York agreement as it seems to have gained more ground than the Hong Kong agreement in the past. It’s also worth noting that normal bitcoin users who hold their private keys will not have to do anything during the process except watch the procedure unfold.

Bitcoin.com was a proud sponsor of Feecon and got the chance to teach attendees about the decentralized currency’s attributes while also showing them why we believe Bitcoin is an innovative tool that will push freedom to new levels. Also Read: Celebrities Continue to Discuss the Subject of Bitcoin With Optimism The Foundation for Economic Education (FEE) is a libertarian organization that is focused on bolstering economics and the principles of a free society. This past week FEE held a three-day gathering in Atlanta, Georgia, that saw a broad range of freedom lovers from all around the world. The event was filled with well-known speakers, exhibits, panel discussions, and liberty inspired networking. Feecon 2017 speakers included Patrick Byrne (Overstock.com), Caitlin Long (Symbiont), Magatte Wade (Tiossan), Stephen Pair (Bitpay), Jeffrey Tucker (FEE), and many more. Alongside the speakers, students and budding entrepreneurs also got a chance to experience over 70 different sessions that incorporated “economic, ethical and legal principles of a free society.” The three days was bustling with people from all around the world who support the liberty movement and was filled with ideas from many individuals and forward-thinking groups dedicated to promoting freedom. There were many organizations providing educational resources such as Freedomfactor.org, Atlas Network, the Ayn Rand Institute, the Bastiat Society, and of course Bitcoin.com was there to provide information on the many benefits the Bitcoin network has to offer. On Saturday, June 17, Feecon participants sat in on a panel discussion that revolved around the future of Bitcoin. The panel included FEE’s Director of content Jeffrey Tucker, the CEO of Bitpay Stephen Pair, and Bitcoin.com’s COO Mate Tokay. The three gave a brief history of their backgrounds with the cryptocurrency space and answered questions on subjects like private keys, cold storage, altcoins, the Bitcoin scaling debate, and much more. [Left to right] Jeffrey Tucker, Mate Tokay, and Stephen Pair discuss the Future of Bitcoin. Many participants of The Future of Bitcoin panel had many questions concerning this growing and innovative landscape of cryptocurrency solutions. Furthermore, throughout the three days, many freedom lovers approached the Bitcoin.com booth to get some insight on how to use the currency, download a wallet, purchase bitcoin, and many more questions that we were delighted to answer.   A few of the Feecon 2017 attendees had only just heard about Bitcoin recently due to the price spike, and there were others who were either fluent users or heard about the technology years prior but never invested. A good majority of Feecon participants were very excited about the Bitcoin network and what it has to offer. Many individuals were looking to learn all they could from talking with us, and we were thrilled to guide them every step of the way. Over the years bitcoin has always been embraced by individuals who hold libertarian ideals, and at Feecon 2017 it was no different. Bitcoin.com was proud to show attendees the many benefits bitcoin has to offer and its future towards helping the world build a freer society that promotes voluntary ideas, free markets, entrepreneurship for both the young and old, and sound economics.

2017-06-19T09:00:11-04:00,Australian Tells Story of Throwing Away Hard Drive With 1400 Bitcoins,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/australian-tells-story-of-throwing-away-hard-drive-hosting-1400-bitcoins/,"Sydney-based technology journalist Campbell Simpson details his story of throwing away a hard drive containing 1400 bitcoin 5 years ago. Also Read: Australian Opposition Leader Believes Bitcoin is Fueling Terrorism In 2010 Campbell spent $25 purchasing tokens distributed by a then obscure, unknown, and predominantly academic project called bitcoin. In exchange for this apparently foolhardy decision, Campbell was sent 1400 bitcoins.  “To be honest, the details are a bit foggy these days” states Campbell. “I Paypal’d some random stranger from the other side of the world a few US dollars for a digital transaction of an effectively worthless faux-currency.” During 2010 bitcoin to fiat trade was virtually nonexistent. The majority of the bitcoin community were miners, mostly tech nerds or academics were involved in the project for reasons of curiosity. Campbell’s interest was sparked after reading an article about bitcoin – prompting him to purchase the nascent cryptocurrency simply to understand it better. Approximately one year later Campbell was moving house and decided to use the opportunity to “clean up some of the accumulated tech detritus that comes with being a technology journalist. USB sticks, 3D glasses, USB cables, PC components. All that sort of literal junk. A pile of junk that went into a skip.” Upon realization of his blunder, Campbell was very calm, describing that “it wasn’t a big deal. It was one of those “aw, crap” moments that happen to everyone on a semi-regular basis. I got a parking ticket, I forgot to send a birthday card to a friend overseas, that kind of thing. Without the benefit of hindsight, of course, it wasn’t that big a deal… Bitcoin was a fun fad.”  In recent years bitcoin has irrefutably proved itself not to be a ‘fun fad’. For Campbell, he genuinely isn’t that upset by knowing that there is a hard drive sitting in a landfill with $3.5 million USD on it that used to be in his possession. “Time has been kind of the price of Bitcoin. Every now and then since… I’ve checked the price. Bitcoin has become pretty popular since 2011. And I’ve done a bit of back-of-the-napkin calculation, and – sometimes, not every time – had a bit of a quiet moment and a shake of my head.” Moving forward, Campbell sees his mistake as only a minor regret. Perhaps knowing that he would have sold his BTC when a single bitcoin was worth approximately $2.50 each helps reconcile the hypothetical loss. “I don’t even especially want to find those Bitcoin, though. I’m really happy with my life at the moment. I don’t need them. I’d like them, sure, but I don’t need them. This isn’t trying to get philosophical – the real value was in the friends we made along the way, or some crap like that…  I spent $25 on some Bitcoin. When I realised what I’d lost, they were worth about $4000. If you wanted to put a dollar figure on the anguish that I feel, it’d be somewhere between those two. Definitely not in the realm of millions of dollars. It’s mostly a fun story that I trot out every now and then, and occasionally pretend to be mock-upset about, and only occasionally actually upset.” Have you ever lost cryptocurrency only to discover it had risen in price?

There seems to be ever-increasing excitement about cryptocurrency in the country.  Also read: Legality of Basic Attention Token and Other ICOs Called Into Question In many places, people are hesitant and skeptical about digital currencies because of possible violent market fluctuations, questionable legality, or concerns about utility. In Venezuela however, no one cannot afford the luxury of being concerned. The price fluctuation is negligible compared to the devalued Bolivar. This has become so apparent that in recent months bitcoin trading has skyrocketed, with last week reaching all time highs according to coin.dance charts. The reason why this is happening is because their native government-issued currency has been a victim of unsustainable inflation and other variables. Jamie Redman, writing for bitcoin.com mentioned this issue, saying, For instance, in a recent article by Financial Times, a mother describes the process of buying food for her family. She purchases a government provided food parcel for 10,000 Bolivars. This is about the same as spending $2 USD. The issue with having such a poor performing, devalued national currency is that it could allow for political corruption, and this may be indicative of why Venezuelans are rapidly adopting bitcoin. Referencing the Bolivar, the Financial times article said, “with such a huge difference between the market price for the goods and the price paid — and an even bigger gap between the official and the black-market dollar exchange rates in Venezuela — the potential for arbitrage, profiteering and corruption in the state-run programme is high.” An Economic Calendar article expanded on why Venezuelans are choosing to use cryptocurrencies like bitcoin instead of the Bolivar. “Though highly volatile, bitcoin is considered more trustworthy than the Venezuelan Bolivar, which has faced massive devaluation since the oil-price collapse began over two years ago.” Do you think more retail investors will start investing in bitcoin soon?

2017-06-18T16:00:25-04:00,Chinese Explore Future of OTC Trading at Bitcoin Meetup,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-explore-explore-future-of-otc-trading-at-bitcoin-meetup/,"In a recent meeting in Chengdu, China, traders explored how over-the-counter (OTC) exchanges will function in the future. The meeting was arranged by BitKan in order to allow bitcoin investors and professionals to come together to build shared trust and understanding.  Also read: Central Bank of Samoa Issues Warning Against Digital Currency The meeting is a result of the fact that Chinese online exchanges again have resumed withdrawals. Kevin Helms, writing for bitcoin.com covered the issue, saying, “Chinese bitcoin exchanges have reportedly resumed bitcoin withdrawals. Customers of BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin can now withdraw their coins up to certain daily limits.” He continued, “Following the inspections by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin halted coin withdrawals in February. Almost four months later, on Wednesday May 31, at least two of them reportedly lifted their cryptocurrency withdrawal suspensions.” It appears that since the withdrawals started, OTC exchanges have declined…but Chinese traders and business people do not want OTC trades to stop. This was one of the important facets of the meeting. The event page on Bitkan’s Facebook noted the event and mentioned what topics they would focus on. Aspects of the talk included: 1.What are the risks in OTC trading? How to avoid them?
2.Under the Chinese government’s policy regulation, what’s the prospect of OTC trading?
3.What are the differences between exchanges and OTC? What are the respective advantages?
4.What’s the situation of OTC trading outside of China? This push for understanding between OTC and online exchanges could mean that bitcoin use and trading in the country will evolve well into the future. It is good news because in the past the “Great Firewall” of China has hamstrung online exchanges. Chinese traders used to rely solely on person-to-person trading, because of stiff government regulation and inspections. However, with both venues for currency exchange available, and traders willing to cooperate, China could be poised to further bolster the bitcoin and altcoin markets. Will Chinese trading and interest in bitcoin continue to grow as a result of cooperation between OTC traders and online exchanges? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

In parallel with these investment types chatting about the rise of digital assets many popular socialites, musicians, and celebrities are talking about bitcoin as well. Also Read: Increased South African Bitcoin Adoption Highlights Need For Taxation Clarity  Bitcoin is growing popular, and you can see the phenomenon as mainstream media reports on the subject nearly every day now. Additionally, many well-known investors such as Mark Cuban, Jeremy Liew, and Chamath Palihapitiya have been discussing the bitcoin topic with news outlets and to their thousands of social media followers. Now a few entertainers, musicians, and celebrities are also mentioning bitcoin in interviews and on Twitter more often these days. Just recently the hip hop artist and entertainer Armando Christian Perez “Pitbull,” talked about bitcoin investment with the news outlet CNBC. Pitbull says he was having a conversation backstage about Bitcoin and says he’s had his eye on the currency for about five years. The entertainer says he’s not invested in it at the moment, but he believes “it’s amazing what they are doing in the virtual world and we see that ‘reality’ is now becoming ‘virtual.’” Pitbull is just one of the many hip-hop entertainers that have talked positively about bitcoin over the years. Other musicians such as Nas and his manager Aymen Anthony Saleh have revealed they are invested in the company Coinbase. Snoop Dogg has also discussed the subject of cryptocurrency over Twitter and the chart-topping rapper Talib Kweli sold his album “Indie 500” for bitcoin. The Apple computers co-founder Steve Wozniak is another well-known individual who discussed bitcoin CNBC this week. Wozniak said he purchased bitcoin when the price was around $700 but initially noticed the technology when it was $70 per BTC. However, Wozniak revealed he didn’t buy bitcoin to invest but rather purchased the digital currency to play around with and test out with different merchants. “I remember getting interested in bitcoin some time ago,” Wozniak explained. “It was $70 for a bitcoin, man and I went online, and you had to have a special bank account at a special bank, and I couldn’t buy any bitcoin, so I gave up. Eventually, I got some of them at the $700 stage, and it went down to $350. I didn’t invest; I did it so I could play with bitcoin.” There have been many other celebrities over the years that have shown interest in bitcoin publicly. Another well-known actor and socialite Ashton Kutcher has also discussed bitcoin in a positive light. Kutcher has made numerous statements about bitcoin and is the co-founder of A-Grade Investments who has a stake in Bitpay. During last year’s U.S. election Kutcher said to his 18 million Twitter followers; Other famous celebrities that have discussed bitcoin publicly include Roseanne Barr, Drew Carey, Akon, Mike Tyson, Joe Rogan, DJ Lethal, and Lily Allen.

Also Read: Researcher from China’s Central Bank Discusses an ICO Regulatory Sandbox Bitmex was co-founded in 2014 by CEO Arthur Hayes and COO Ben Delo, with CTO Samuel Reed having also been involved from the company’s inception. Within 3 years the exchange has grown to handle approximately $75 million USD worth of daily trade across the company’s products.  Bitmex has shown an invulnerability to recent Chinese regulatory crackdowns upon bitcoin exchanges, which has sought to bring cryptocurrency exchanges in-line with mainstream financial institutional practices. CEO Arthur Hayes described the perversely positive outcomes enjoyed by Bitmex as a result of the regulatory actions.“We are bitcoin only so we don’t take government issue fiat currency, so if a banking system gets shutdown it doesn’t really affect us because people can still move bitcoin in and out of the platform because it’s purely a tech protocol. If anything, China shutting down the exchanges helped increase our volume because if you want leverage trading… you probably can’t do it anymore in China” COO Ben Delo also weighed in on the recent interference into Chinese bitcoin exchanges’ operations on the part of regulators. “I think the regulatory actions in China are not so much about bitcoin as they are about currency controls. They let you send RMB in and buy and sell bitcoin, you just can’t withdraw that bitcoin, you can’t take it out of China – it’s wanting to avoid the appearance of capital leaving the country by that mechanism.” The Bitmex representatives expressed strong skepticism with regards to the People’s Bank of China considering issuing RMP via blockchain technology, articulating strong warning against the political ambitions that may be realized through such a project. “They want to get rid of cash.” said Delo. “They want to control it. Already people are using Alipay and WeChat pay to handle day-to-day transactions. They want to take it a step further. By introducing electronic RMB it may have certain blockchain elements but ultimately it will all be controlled by the government. They want to track every movement of every bit of cash”  When discussing what’s in store for the next generation of bitcoin businesses, COO Ben Delo highlighted concerns that bitcoin speculation may be undermining bitcoin’s ability to reach its full potential in terms of utility, and that future successful start-ups may seek to reconcile and circumvent said antagonism. “In some parts of Africa you’ve got some people using phone credit as a form of money. Tech like Bitcoin could provide the world with banking facilities without the need to actually setup infrastructure. At the moment you can’t do that because Bitcoin is a volatile, speculative currency. But once people build the next generation of cryptocurrency wallets, they will start offering something like a bitcoin-backed US dollar, that is worth a US dollar, and be transacted on a blockchain. Once you’ve got that you can start offering banking to the unbanked just on an app.” Only from this basis, Delo speculated, can products such as peer-to-peer finance, insurance, investments options, etc., be sustainably delivered via blockchain technology.

2017-06-18T09:00:06-04:00,Bitpesa CEO Claims Bitcoin-Based Remittance Companies Have Reduced Costs by 75%,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpesa-ceo-claims-bitcoin-based-remittance-companies-have-reduced-costs-by-75/,"Bitpesa founder and CEO, Elizabeth Rossiello, has claimed that bitcoin-based remittance services have reduced the costs of international payments by 75%, and reduced the average time of settlement from 12 days to approximately 12 hours. Rossiello also discussed the African cryptocurrency economy and changing attitudes towards bitcoin on the part of major international financial institutions and mainstream media outlets. Also Read: Bitmari Becomes First Bitcoin Company to Partner With an African Commercial Bank Bitpesa was created in 2013 and has achieved significant success providing a cheaper, faster remittance service to African markets than Moneygram or Western Union. Bitpesa CEO, Elizabeth Rossiello, claims that Bitpesa has transformed the African remittance industry and created positive change across the African continent. “Bitpesa was the first company in the world to establish a market between African currencies and digital currencies. We lowered the cost of international payments by 75% and reduced the time to settle between currencies from 12 days to less than 2 hours.”  Bitpesa currently primarily operates in Uganda, Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania, and has headquarters in Luxembourg. The company is licensed in the UK by the FCA. Aside from offering services to individuals and small businesses, Bitpesa claims that numerous multi-national corporations rely on their services to circumvent inefficient and unreliable payment settlements that plague the African financial sector. For Rossiello, Africa offers a unique opportunity to bitcoin and cryptocurrency services. The lack of economic development and poor juridical apparatus associated with Africa begs for the types of services that bitcoin and cryptocurrency can offer. Rossiello also discussed the changing attitudes held toward bitcoin by major international financial and super-national organizations, as well as the mainstream media. “There was a big misconception repeated in the media about the technology being less safe – despite the fact that the Bank of England, the World Economic Forum and the IMF have all conducted research stating the technology has a low-risk for fraud, certainly much less than cash and traditional transfer methods. The technology is here to stay and the tone has begun to change in the media. Making global payments using the bitcoin blockchain is safer, more efficient, and cheaper.”  Citizens accross the african continent are starting to see an expansion in the bitcoin-based remittance services offered that are available to them. Vietnamese based/African incorporated remittance service provider Remitano has recently expanded its services into the Nigerian, Kenyan, and Tanzanian markets, moving to directly compete for Bitpesa’s market share. Although the positive benefits from bitcoin-based remittance providers operating in Africa are undeniable, it should be noted the majority of major companies are based off-shore – resulting in a minor maintenance of the ‘foreign-based money transmitters profiting from African labor’ business model that cryptocurrency remittances were seemingly destined to annihilate during the wide-eyed infancy of bitcoin. The recent announcement that Zimbabwe based remittance company Bitmari has become the first bitcoin company to work in partnership with an African commercial bank comprises excellent news for the African bitcoin remittance industry. African companies developing an early foothold within the bitcoin remittance-space would drive much needed economic dynamism on the African continent, and potentiate a total recapture of the capital lost through the process of international money transmission on the part of the African economy.

2017-06-17T19:00:01-04:00,Popular Japanese Capsule Hotels Embracing Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-capsule-hotels-bitcoin/,"Since the Japanese government started recognizing bitcoin, an increasing number of merchants in the country have adopted it as a payment option. Among them are a couple of Japan’s iconic and popular capsule hotels. Also read: Bitcoin to Be Accepted at 260,000 Stores in Japan by This Summer Capsule hotels, sometimes called pod hotels, are found all over Japan. “They’re unlike any other accommodation: Individual pods, sometimes dozens to a room, each a self-contained mini-hotel room, with a bed, lights, and sometimes even a TV,” Forbes contributor Geoffrey Morrison described. The Japanese bitcoin exchange Coincheck provides two capsule hotels with merchant payment solutions. The luxury capsule hotel Anshin Oyado started accepting bitcoin in March, while the Comics & Capsule Hotel Comicap began accepting it as of this Friday. In an earlier interview, Coincheck told Bitcoin.com that the company “holds 99% of the bitcoin payment market share.” The company charges 1% fee per transaction on bitcoin payments, which is only “1/3 to 1/5 of the credit card transaction fee,” its website details. Payments are converted to yen and deposited in merchants accounts immediately. Starting on Friday, Comics & Capsule Hotel Comicap operated by Runsystem Co. Ltd. is accepting bitcoin payments using Coincheck’s system. Opened in February, this 60-room accommodation in Kyoto describes itself as “a cosmopolitan relaxation space with tens of thousands of comic books, mainly in the form of capsule hotel style accommodation.” There are over 30,000 comic books on the premises and a room there can cost as low as ¥2,000 (approximately $18) per person when booked online. Runsystem also operates another Comicap hotel of the same concept which is located in Sapporo, the largest city on the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido. The company also owns Jiyuukuukan, a “popular Manga cafe in Japan,” Coincheck Business Development Lead Kagayaki Kawabata told Bitcoin.com. These related businesses, however, have not yet decided to accept bitcoin. The Comics & Capsule Hotel Comicap announced this week: In March, the Tokyo-based Anshin Oyado, operated by the Sanza Group, became the first capsule hotel to accept bitcoin. It is also the very first in the hotel industry in Japan to do so, according to Coincheck, who facilitates the hotel’s bitcoin payments. There are five Anshin Oyado capsule hotels in the Tokyo area. The one that accepts bitcoin is in front of Shinjuku station, which is the world’s busiest metro station based on the daily number of passengers passing through, according to the Guinness World Records. A room there costs between ¥4,980 and ¥6,180 (~$45-$55), according to its website. “This company also operates the karaoke box chain Pasera which is pretty popular in Japan,” Kawabata shared with Bitcoin.com. While operators of both Comicap and Anshin Oyado capsule hotels have other businesses that do not currently accept bitcoin, Kawabata noted: Would you like to stay in a capsule hotel you paid for with bitcoin?

Now the researchers and programmers involved with the idea have submitted a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) to the bitcoin developers list for feedback and review. Also Read: Some Blockchain Tokens are Securities, Researchers Find Dandelion is a concept designed by the Zcash advisor and developer Andrew Miller and a team of University of Illinois researchers. A few months ago the team released its white paper ‘Dandelion: Redesigning the Bitcoin Network for Anonymity.’ The project is a new type of transaction broadcasting method that aims to stop people snooping and locating Internet Protocol addresses (IP). Essentially transactions relayed to nodes go through a few hops followed by a symmetric broadcast sent to other nodes which cannot identify the original IP source. According to the recently submitted Github proposal Dandelion works in two phases.   “[The first phase] is the “stem” phase, and then “fluff” phase,” explains the Dandelion BIP. “During the stem phase, each node relays the transaction to a *single* peer. After a random number of hops along the stem, the transaction enters the fluff phase, which behaves just like ordinary flooding/diffusion. Even when an attacker can identify the location of the fluff phase, it is much more difficult to identify the source of the stem.” In addition to submitting the BIP to Github Dandelion’s developer Andrew Miller also wrote a letter of intent to the bitcoin developers via the Linux Foundation mailing list. Miller states the team has put together the preliminary implementations for the Dandelion BIP and he would love it if developers provided them with feedback.    Furthermore, Miller details the Dandelion team is experimenting with the code on the Bitcoin testnet and will report findings to the mailing list. Additionally, in comparison to the original white paper, the current BIP includes several new design features says Miller. This includes a stronger attacker model and a more robust propagation implementation. The latest privacy enhancing BIP Dandelion comes at a time when governments everywhere are looking to enforce strict AML and KYC regulations towards bitcoin users. Many bureaucrats and law enforcement agencies have been pushing for many privacy-invasive measures and blockchain surveillance tools for quite some time. The Dandelion BIP was once again well received by many bitcoin proponents across forums and social media on June 13. In addition to the Dandelion news, Breeze Wallet, another privacy enhancing mechanism that implements the Tumblebit protocol is rumored to be released at the end of the month.

Also read: Bitcoin ETN Crosses $100 Million After Unprecedented Demand From Investors, Partners With Xapo The Monex Group is an international financial services company headquartered in Tokyo. The company released the twenty-third Monex Global Investor Survey on Thursday which includes a section on digital currency investments. The survey was conducted from May 29 to June 5 this year. Customers of three Monex Group subsidiaries were asked; Monex Inc. in Japan, Tradestation Securities Inc. in the U.S., and Monex Boom Securities Limited in Hong Kong. There were 872 respondents in Japan, 122 in the U.S., and 300 in Hong Kong. Despite the government recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment on April 1, the number of Japanese digital currency investors is still very low, the survey found. Monex wrote: 
The survey also shows that, among Monex’s customers, those in Japan are much more familiar with digital currencies than those in the U.S. or Hong Kong. Only 2.4% of respondents in Japan admitted that they are not familiar with digital currencies, compared to over 20% in the other two countries. Monex’s survey is focused on Japanese investors since most of the respondents were in Japan. Even though only 3% of Monex’s customers in Japan claim to have invested in digital currency, bitcoin trading volume in the country has been constantly growing. Record numbers of customer signups and trading volume were seen at bitcoin exchanges. Last week, Japan’s largest exchange by volume, Bitflyer, announced that “due to a rapid increase in the number of customers we serve, we are experiencing delays in our responses to customer support inquiries.” More companies have also applied to become bitcoin exchanges with the Japanese Financial Services Agency. Some are big corporations such as GMO, which launched its bitcoin trading platform last month. The sheer number of customers swarming the platform caused the company to delay its opening and then brought the website down on the day of its launch. Meanwhile, Japanese retail investors are fed up with low savings interest rates and pension problems, driving some to digital currencies. They are also increasingly gaining exposure to bitcoin as more merchants start accepting it. Major stores such as Bic Camera have already started accepting bitcoin for retail payments. Recently, Peach Aviation announced several bitcoin services while 1,400 hotels and inns across Japan are set to start accepting bitcoin this summer.

From the break of bitcoin’s preceding $1200 all-time to the establishment of $3000 as the local top, bitcoin had seen a spike in price that reached the 2.68 Fibonacci extension area.  This last week has seen price retrace down the 50 percent retracement area of the bull run from the previous all-time high, with the current price action appearing to be heading for a retest of the 78.6 Fibonacci retracement area of approximately $2600.  The trading community now appears to be anxiously awaiting to see whether or not the current price action will come to comprise a healthy retracement, or a dead cat bounce. Yesterday’s test of $2100 USD established an ascending trend-line on the 4-hour chart, signifying that the bull run may not be over. However, whether or not bitcoin can establish a new high remains to be seen, with many traders expecting the current bounce to encounter significant resistance in the $2600 – $2700 USD range. Should a lower top form, the question will be whether or not bitcoin can again bounce off the ascending trend-line and begin to form a symmetrical triangle formation, or it will break the trend-line and potentially form a head and shoulders formation.      Although many of the altcoin markets, especially Ethereum, have seen dramatic price rises and record-breaking growth in total market capitalization, the recent reversal of the historic inverse correlation between bitcoin and altcoin price movements has seen other cryptocurrency markets lose dollar-value alongside bitcoin. As a consequence, ETH, ZEC, ETC, XMP, XRP, DASH, and REP all saw dollar-value losses off approximately 30% or higher alongside bitcoin between the 12th and 15th of June. Although Ethereum looks as though it may be able to rival bitcoin’s total market capitalization, recent bitcoin volatility has seen ETH suffer significant dollar-value losses. During bitcoin’s 30% retracement from May 25-27, Ethereum lost 50% of its dollar-value, leading some to question the ability for Ethereum to sustain its dramatic growth long-term should bitcoin’s momentum begin to reverse.

We made this decision as a result of the unnecessary high fees due to the current block size limit, which has been supported by the Blockstream and Core teams. It is our hope that this issue is resolved soon. Until then, we will do everything to offset the disincentivizing effects of high fees.  Also read: Bitcoin ETN Crosses $100 Million After Unprecedented Demand From Investors, Partners With Xapo Last September we launched our mining pool. It was the first in the world to singularly support Bitcoin Unlimited. We started our pool to help reduce massive congestion on the network. Currently, transaction speeds are still weighed down by high fees, and we wanted to start a pool that provided miners with stronger reward incentives in this environment.  We still believe Bitcoin Unlimited and an immediate hard fork is the best resolution to the current quagmire. Our Chief Technical officer, Emil Oldenburg, explains this saying, “I really wish transaction accelerators weren’t necessary. We need to remove the block size from the consensus code like Bitcoin Unlimited has done and let the blocks be as big as necessary. This will lead to a healthier and more innovative discussion on blockchain and transaction optimizations. We can’t fix the congestion by building a transaction accelerator; we must raise the block size limit.” Until the ecosystem comes to a consensus on the current scaling dilemma, Bitcoin.com will continue to do everything to promote increased block sizes. It is our hope that Blockstream and Core’s half-measures are not accepted and their desire to control the network is checked, lest bitcoin neutrality is hamstrung and the ecosystem suffers as a result of incompetence, poor judgement, and hunger for power.

Also Read: Bitmari Becomes First Bitcoin Company to Partner With an African Commercial Bank The remittance industry has been expected to suffer great disruption at the hands of bitcoin since it’s inception. The global remittance industry has been valued at over $500 billion USD annually in recent years, yielding exorbitant profits for the middle-men who have monopolized the international circulation of money. Remitano has recently announced that it will be expanding its services outside of Asia, with Nigeria, Kenya, and Tanzania. Remitano began its life a start-up in Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam, before incorporating in the African nation of Seychelles and being offered as a product under Babylon Solutions Limited. Remitano now provides remittance services to more than 10 different nations, including Vietnam, Malaysia, the United States, Australia, United Kingdom, China, India, and Ghana.  Remitano initially garnered attention for being the bitcoin exchange that experiences the most traffic in Vietnam, despite Vietnam’s notoriously unclear regulations when it comes to bitcoin. Vietnam first addressed the digital currency officially by issuing a warning in February 2014 stating that bitcoin wasn’t recognized as legal tender, nor covered by commercial or consumer legislation. In October of 2014 three bitcoin traders were arrested, but the request for charges was rejected by the judge as “[bitcoin had] not been subject to any legal regulations”. At present, financial institutions are forbidden from owning and transacting in bitcoin. The Vietnamese ban on financial institutions from transacting in bitcoin has not prevented businesses such as Remitano from flourishing. In addition to Remitano, Bitcoin Vietnam has achieved success as an exchange, operating in partnership with Israeli company Bit2C for several years. As Remitano and Bitcoin Vietnam facilitate a marketplace that allows private individuals to transact in bitcoin, the companies themselves have managed to evade operating outside of Vietnamese cryptocurrency regulations. The bitcoin-based remittance industry has started to gain traction in Africa. Last year the African economy lost over $60 billion USD to remittance fees, illustrating the imperative need for an alternative solution to the current mainstream remittance industry. Recently, the largest pan-African wallet provider, Bitmari, applied for an international remittance license with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. Competition between remittance providers in Africa like Remitano and Bitmari will reap further benefits for local economies. The expansion of companies like Remitano further embed bitcoin into the normal, daily lives of citizens across the globe, signaling that for some countries, mainstream bitcoin adoption may not be far away.

2017-06-15T15:00:29-04:00,Global Bitcoin ATM Proliferation Nearly Doubled During May,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/global-bitcoin-atm-proliferation-nearly-doubled-during-may/,"The global proliferation of bitcoin ATMs nearly doubled during May when compared with April. The United States and Canada saw increases in the number of bitcoin ATMs by almost 8%, whilst Russia’s bitcoin ATM presence evaporated following the withdrawal of Bitlish. Also Read: South Korea to Dispose of 216 Bitcoins in First Public Auction  May saw significant price gains. Last month also saw a considerable expansion in the number of bitcoin ATMs internationally. Coinatmradar reported an overall growth in the number of bitcoin ATMs of 6.7 percent internationally, as May saw 95 new bitcoin ATMs installed. 17 bitcoin ATMs were closed bringing the total of reported bitcoin ATMs to 1236.  The majority of the growth took place in North America, with America seeing 7.9% (+55 ATMs), and Canada seeing the growth of 7.8% (+12 ATMs). The United Kingdom saw growth of 11.5% (+7 ATMs), and Japan saw growth of 36.4% (+4 bitcoin ATMs). Bitlish closed its three ATMs located in St. Petersburg, which were the sole bitcoin ATMs in Russia reported to the site Coinatmradar. Bitlish’s exit from the Russian market comes amidst claims that it plans to install 5,000 new bitcoin ATMs across Europe – although the company’s hasty exodus has left some analysts skeptical regarding how long the ATMs are likely to remain open. As indicated by Coinatmradar, The United States currently holds a significant lead over countries for the number of active ATMs, with 851 currently in operation. Canada is second with 167 ATM locations, followed by the United Kingdom (68 ATMs), Spain (34 ATMs), Austria (25 ATMs), and Finland (21 ATMs).  North America currently host 75% percent of all bitcoin ATMs as reported by Coinatmradar. European ATMs accounts for 20% per cent of the total. Coinatmradar’s data almost entirely pertains to major companies issuing bitcoin ATMs, and thus is likely an inacurate representation of the number of bitcoin ATMs that are independently or privately installed. Although the number of ATMs issued by major companies in a region is a narrow indicator by which to judge the development of its cryptocurrency economy, this data suggests that much of the developing world still has a long way to go in developing its cryptocurrency economy and infrastructure.

2017-06-15T11:30:41-04:00,Nepal Joins Cadre of Communist Countries Who Seek to Stifle Local Bitcoin Adoption,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/nepal-joins-cadre-of-communist-countries-who-seek-to-stifle-local-bitcoin-adoption/,"Nepal has emphasized the need to develop a legal framework for monitoring Bitcoin and other ‘informal channeling of funds’ during recent budget and tax announcements, joining a number of communist societies that are seeking to control the use of bitcoin. Also Read: Tealet is Decentralizing the Tea Industry with Bitcoin Nepal has recently announced its desire to devise a legal framework through which to monitor the informal channeling of funds through bitcoin and electronic currency transfers. The government also expressed its plan to implement an electronic payment system through the banking channel for the settlement of tax liabilities – hinting that it may seek to develop a national cryptocurrency similar to the ‘masterchain’ national cryptocurrency recently developed by Russia, or Singapore’s recent experiments with issuing Singaporean Dollars via distributed ledger.  The announcement that Nepal is seeking to regulate bitcoin comes in spite of the Nepalese bitcoin economy being amongst the least developed in the world, with no private exchanges offering trade between bitcoin and the Nepalese Rupee, and less than 20% of citizens connected to the internet. Although Nepal currently has not legally classified bitcoin, local papers are said to have reported that the Nepalese Central Bank has forbidden all transactions in cryptocurrency. Nepal hosts one of the world’s six communist governments, joined by China, Laos, Cuba, Vietnam, and North Korea – all of whom exercise strict capital controls within their borders. As such, it is unsurprising that many of these governments have sought to restrict and stifle the development of bitcoin within their borders, with the developed cities of China comprising the sole exception.  China’s relationship with bitcoin has been well documented, with the threat of Chinese regulation causing numerous shake-downs in bitcoin’s price in recent years. China recently cracked down on high margin trading ratios permitted on bitcoin exchanges, describing such as having a manipulative effect upon the markets. Although China is moving toward a permissive regulatory framework pertaining to bitcoin trading and exchange operation, recent reports have alleged that Chinese officials are forcefully shutting bitcoin mines in Sichuan – where cheap hydropower has lured investment from mining operators. These reports suggest that China will likely seek to limit the adoption of bitcoin throughout the many underdeveloped, loosely governed provinces outside of China’s center, especially mining, as bitcoin could facilitate the development of a myriad of informal economies outside of Beijing’s central control.   In other communist nations, bitcoin adoption has been hampered by poor internet access. In Laos, less than 20% of citizens have access to the internet. There are no native bitcoin exchanges, and with Laos considered one of the hardest countries in the world to start a business in, it is very unlikely that this will change soon. There are only a handful of local cash vendors on localbitcoins, suggesting that Laos’ few bitcoin merchants are operating underground. Vietnam was amongst the first countries to introduce stifling regulation with regards to bitcoin, banning businesses from owning or transacting in bitcoin in 2014. Despite the laws, some bitcoin companies have been able to operate as an exchange or remittance business, through facilitating bitcoin trade as opposed to transacting in the virtual currency. Cuba saw its first officially reported bitcoin transaction between Cuba and the US took place in 2015, which was conducted by Cuban bitcoin advocacy group, BitcoinCuba. Although Cuba has started to see some basic public wi-fi networks, only 30% of Cubans are approximated to have internet access.  Outside of the new public hotspots and state-run cyber cafes, most Cubans are forced to pay to $2 USD for 1 hour of internet, despite an average Cuban salary of approximately $20 per month – leaving very few citizens able to afford the luxury of researching cryptocurrency online. With Cuba already struggling to maintain its two-currency system, it is very unlikely that Cuba’s government will encourage the use of bitcoin amongst the minority who are connected to the internet. With the internet nearly exclusively used as an instrument of the state, North Korea has been able to shield itself from the globalizing effects of cryptocurrency. Recent reports have suggested that the North Korean state has been actively engaged with bitcoin, as North Korea is alleged to have stolen approximately $88,000 USD each month South Korean bitcoin exchanges from 2013 to 2015. The recent Wannacry ransomware attacks have seen speculations of involvement on the part of the shadowy Lazarus group – of whom Kapersky Lab claims to have found evidence suggesting ties with North Korean servers. With Nepal’s government moving toward bitcoin regulations, it is apparent that the communist nations of the world are unlikely to pave an easy road toward bitcoin adoption. Although bitcoin’s fluidity is astounding, basic problems of poor internet access, inefficient and corrupt bureaucratic structures, and tightly-controlled underdeveloped economic structures may pose a significant barrier to bitcoin’s growth within the developing communist world.

In doing so, the economic value of bitcoin will be recognized by the country for the first time. Also read: Why South Korean Bitcoin Adoption Could Outpace Most Other Countries This Year The Korea Asset Management Corporation (KAMCO) has decided to auction off 216 bitcoins of criminal proceeds seized in April, according to local publications on Wednesday. KAMCO is a government-owned asset management company in South Korea. It manages state-owned properties, collects overdue taxes, as well as purchases and resolves non-performing loans of financial institutions. Since seizing bitcoins, the organization has been contemplating what to do with the digital currency since there was no precedence. On Wednesday, MSN Korea quoted a KAMCO official saying (loosely translated): The 216 bitcoins were confiscated in April by the Southern Gyeonggi Provincial Police Agency from an operator of an “obscene” website which had generated about 1.7 billion won from 1.2 million members. It was the first time a domestic investigative agency seized digital currency as a criminal profit. Subsequently, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled since the seizure. Its value rose from 260 million won to 673 million won (approximately $596,500 USD) at press time on popular Korean bitcoin exchange Korbit. According to South Korean Criminal Procedure Law, when a court confiscates an asset from an investigative agency, it becomes the property of the state, The Seoul Economic Daily explains. If forfeited, the asset will be valued and auctioned off to the treasury. An official of the prosecution conveyed (loosely translated): The commission on this bitcoin auction is estimated to be about 20 million won or 3% of the proceeds. It will be deducted from the balance and the remainder transferred to the treasury. “Real estate and securities other than legal currency are regulated by the presidential decree so that they can be sold by the presidential decree,” KAMCO explained. “Virtual currencies are not included in the public auction exemption, so it is possible to dispose of it.” The representative of the prosecution noted, “once the prosecution goes to a bitcoin auction, the social controversy over whether or not virtual currency should be recognized is actually over,” The Seoul Economic Daily reported.

Shorten suggested that terrorists are starting to leverage dark markets and other nefarious venues to fuel their bad deeds.  Also read: The Hidden Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Increasing Fees: Darknet Mixers He said, “I refer to the use of the digital currency bitcoin and the use of the dark web, a network of untraceable online activities and hidden websites, allowing those who wish to stay in the shadows to remain hidden. Terrorists are increasingly using this network to avoid detection, conduct planning and acquire capability and tools to carry out their evil actions” Shorten loosely admitted that government does not yet know enough about cryptocurrency or the dark web to handle them. In his statement he referenced them, saying, “There are two things we simply do not know enough about to deal with properly.” This also implies the Australian government could approach the issue in a variety of ways, but that cryptocurrency is a growing concern as a result of possible “terrorism.” He finished by claiming certain actions are necessary for the safety and security of the Australian citizens. He said: The Australian leader wants everyone in their country to share their fear of dark markets and cryptocurrencies since terrorists could possibly exploit them. However, the current times are strange. Some countries and their government, like Australia, harbor a deep skepticism toward cryptocurrencies and bitcoin. But others seem to take a more positive approach. They may even love digital currencies. For instance, places like Japan and, more recently, Russia…appear to harbor more positive and loving feelings toward the currencies. Japan has already accepted digital currencies on the whole, and Russia is considering it as vitally important for the future. On the other side of the coin, some countries like Ecuador, have already banned cryptocurrencies and punish people for using them. It seems that Australia’s leadership has similar sentiments like in Ecuador, except not quite as extreme. It is increasingly interesting to watch varying perspectives crop up within different countries around the world as bitcoin and other crypto-assets become more popular.

Also Read: Scam Alert Round-Up: We Grow Bitcoin, Ethereumchamber and Etherum Project Bitcoin-based ransomware viruses have gained international attention following the devastating results of the Wannacry ransomware last month. Wannacry infected thousands of businesses spanning across approximately 100 nations, and including a devastating attack on the British NHS.  Last week, researchers at Fortinet publicized the new virus, Macransom, a ransomware program that exclusively targets Apple systems. If a system is infected, Macransom will encrypt the contents of a user’s computer, and threaten to delete such if a ransom of 0.25 bitcoins is not paid. Although not as sophisticated as Wannacry, Macransom is available for purchase on the darknet – leading to concerns about the potential for the virus to spread rapidly. Macransom is available for purchase alongside other malicious software such as Macspy, a highly concerning spyware virus that members of the cryptocurrency community should be aware of. Macspy allows scammers to monitor an infected computer, capture passwords and other private information through keystroke logging, and even record audio via an infected computer’s microphone. Macspy also claims to be untraceable, owing to use of The Onion Router to mask communications. These apple-targeting viruses emphasize the need for Mac users to exercise caution online. Although it is true that the majority of malicious software targets Windows systems, Fortinet security experts Rommel Joven and Wayne Chin Yick Low dispelled the popular misconception that Apple products are inherently more secure than Windows systems in a recent interview with Daily Mail UK. “Many Mac OS users might assume that their computer is exempt from things like ransomware attacks and think that their system is somehow essentially ‘secure’. It is true that it’s less likely for a Mac OS user to be attacked or infected by malware than a Windows user, but this has nothing to do with the level of vulnerability in the operating system.”  Bitcoin has driven rapid advancements in the innovation and sophistication of many industries. Unfortunately, malicious viruses have been one of the industries to benefit from cryptocurrency technology. Ransomware software existed before bitcoin, the ability for law enforcement to police such has been made far more difficult by bitcoin, as evidenced by the Zeus virus’ evolution. Originally reliant upon a transnational money smuggling ring in order to courier ransoms back to Eastern Europe, the virus Zeus has become far less traceable since adopting its current cryptolocker incarnation. Despite the potential damage that can be reaped by bitcoin-based ransomware, the challenges posed by such can often easily be circumvented by exercising a stringent cyber security policy.

The company aims to cover the higher fees by spreading the cost fairly among customers. Also read: Popular Demand Spurs Goldman Sachs to Start Covering Bitcoin  Localbitcoins has introduced a new fee structure which will affect all customers. Citing the rising Bitcoin network fees, the company announced on Tuesday the details of their new fees: The Finland-based company with bitcoin sellers and buyers in almost every country further explained that “you can save further on the sending fee by timing your transaction to when the network is quiet.” However, the new “deposit fees will be larger than the new sending fees,” they disclosed, adding that “generally we expect it to be about 3x the amount of sending fees per transaction.” The existing fee structure at Localbitcoins has the drawback of overcharging fees to users withdrawing bitcoins, but none to those depositing them. Sellers will now be covering two Bitcoin network fees; one for the cost of sending the coins into escrow and the second from escrow to the buyer. With the new fee system, “we want to spread these costs more fairly between our customers” the company wrote. Over the years, Localbitcoins found that a large part of each Bitcoin transaction fee was used to cover the costs related to deposits, not withdrawals. The company clarified: The new deposit fee will ensure that the customers who make lots of small network transactions that cause larger network fees “will pay a larger share of the overall transaction costs.” Meanwhile, the customers who merely withdraw their coins “will enjoy lower fees.” Also announced on Tuesday was an automatic fee adjustment feature on every transaction “based on how congested the Bitcoin network is.” Traffic on the Bitcoin network will be constantly monitored and fees adjusted to ensure the overall fees paid are smaller, Localbitcoins claims.

2017-06-13T17:10:04-04:00,The Hidden Reason Behind Bitcoin’s Increasing Fees: Darknet Mixers,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-hidden-reason-behind-bitcoins-increasing-fees-darknet-mixers/,"Just recently a darknet marketplace (DNM) vendor who details he’s been involved with the bitcoin industry for five years, says the rising fee market is caused by marketplace mixers that process multiple transactions at a time. The vendor details that DNM sales using these mixers are forcing him and many others to pay for 50 transactions at a time at ten times the cost, to cover their tracks.  Also read: Hedge Funds Are Quietly Investing in Bitcoin    As much as people don’t like to talk about it, bitcoin has been used widely across DNMs across the deep web for years. Many people believe the lion’s share of bitcoin transactions come from DNM sales. Since the inception of the first DNM — the Silk Road — illicit narcotic sales have increased exponentially. Furthermore, two years after the sentencing of the Silk Road operator there are more online marketplaces located on the deep web than ever before. Over the past year, these markets have been extremely busy as bitcoin’s value has skyrocketed and many of the top underground market users have reported on experiencing big issues with withdrawals. According to many forum posts, a lot of people have been having problems withdrawing from the leading DNM Alpha Bay. Additionally, there have been congestion issues over the past month on other popular markets such as Dream, Valhalla, and Hansa. “Add me to the long list of people who can’t get their funds out of Alpha Bay,” explains a DNM consumer on Reddit. “I have been trying to withdraw a couple of hundred dollars worth of BTC for several weeks now. I go the transfer page, fill in all of the information, but after I submit the transaction, the page refreshes like the transaction has gone through, but when the page is done refreshing, it’s like I never submitted a transaction.” According to one particular DNM vendor, he believes the super high fees lately are attributed to black market sales. Nobody seems to understand the rising fee market is coming from that “invisible” web. The vendor who deals with cannabis sales details that in his opinion DNMs are “responsible for the lion’s share of bitcoin transactions daily.” According to him, there are hundreds of thousands of transactions coming from DNMs daily, rated around 550-600 satoshis. The obvious reason for this he explains is so “drug addicts can get their shit as fast as possible.” Many of the top DNMs found on the deep web have their own mixing services for customers who want to cover their tracks. The tumblers used on Alpha Bay and other DNMs continuously split transfers into multiple transactions at a time, which could quite possibly be adding more strain to the bitcoin network’s throughput. The cannabis dealer states the bitcoin network fee estimation is “way off the radar” these days, mainly because DNMs are catering to addicts who want their products shipped as soon as possible. There is no doubt that DNMs are getting used far more than they were back in 2013, and back then the underground sales attributed to a vast majority of bitcoin transfers. The vendor’s theory may be more truthful than a lot of people would like to admit, as much of the focus these days has been on mainstream adoption. The likelihood of the fee market and network congestion rising due to more DNM usage is quite probable even though the discussion is not so favorable to everyone. What do you think about DNM use boosting the fee market and adding to the network congestion? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

Goldman Sachs subsequently released a client report called “GS Techs: Quick BTC” on Monday, according to the publication. “Due to popular demand, it’s worth taking a quick look at bitcoin here,” Jafari wrote, adding that the firm’s overall outlook is: Goldman Sachs’ report explains how it came up with the bearish outlook using technical analysis, Zero Hedge detailed. The firm claims bitcoin’s extended target price for a 3rd of V-waves, using the ratio of 2.618, is $3,134, which was almost reached on Monday. “Both daily/weekly oscillators are diverging negatively. All of this to say that the balance of signals are looking broadly heavy,” the report reads. Following the third wave, the firm then explained its view on what’s to come:  Many people have recently offered their views on what they think the price of bitcoin will be. One of the most bullish in recent history is from Blockchain’s CEO Peter Smith, who is on the record for predicting: Daniel Masters, the chairman of XBT Provider, early this month told CNBC that he expects bitcoin to reach $4,000 by the end of the year. “Bitcoin is emerging as the transactional layer of the internet, as programmable money and as digital gold. That’s the big picture,” he said. At the end of February, BTCC CEO Bobby Lee tweeted his specific prediction. “Bitcoin price target in 2020 after block halving: USD $5k-$11k, assuming $5-$10 million daily flow into #BTC by then,” he wrote. “There is a lot of fresh liquidity flowing into bitcoin, thanks to a surge in interest among investors in Asia, notably Japan and Korea, coupled with a resolution to the scaling debate,” Aurelien Menant, the CEO of bitcoin exchange Gatecoin, said in May. “I would not be surprised to see the bitcoin price doubling again to around $6,000 by the end of the year.” After hearing about hedge funds experimenting with bitcoin, RT TV host Max Keiser tweeted his prediction on Sunday: Do you think Goldman Sachs is too bearish on bitcoin?

2017-06-12T19:00:26-04:00,The Rise of Digital Money Has Exploded Since Bitcoin’s Creation,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/digital-money-exploded-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin changed the landscape of digital money when it was introduced to the world in 2009, and was followed by many other types of cryptocurrencies. Now bitcoin and the over 800 copycats (so called altcoins) have reached a very large market valuation of $110 billion. Let’s take a look at how this emerging digital assets landscape began and where we are today. Also read: Are Asian Markets Creating a Bitcoin Price Bubble? Since the beginning of the Internet’s early days, the concept of digital money has always intrigued the human race. When the world wide web really started to become popularized during the late eighties, and throughout the nineties, online privacy activists called cypherpunks began creating and envisioning digital currencies. David Chaum and many other well-known cryptographers helped pave the way for a technology like bitcoin. One of the first digital currencies was Digicash, created by Chaum, and was later sold and used for bank-to-bank settlements only. There were many other efforts during those years that tried to create the perfect Internet currency such as Hashcash, e-gold, and Bitgold. However these ideas never really caught on until an anonymous developer named Satoshi Nakamoto revealed his white paper called ‘Bitcoin’ in 2008. The following year in January the Bitcoin network was born while the central banking system was once again quantitatively easing the world away from economic failure.   Following Bitcoin’s success at being the first cryptographic currency with a blockchain, the technology showed it had a better chance than the predecessors conceived before it. Additionally, other cryptocurrencies appeared on the scene shortly after the birth of Bitcoin. Some of the earliest blockchain-based digital assets include Litecoin, Namecoin, Feathercoin, and Peercoin. Some of them offered different algorithms, a new feature, or different amounts of tokens. For instance, the first scrypt coin was Tenebrix which led to the vast myriad of other coins that were supposed to be ‘ASIC proof,’ but that turned out to be untrue. Litecoin followed the idea of Tenebrix with its scrypt based algorithm and has remained a top ten contending cryptocurrency, valuation-wise, since its inception. After Litecoin, other cryptocurrencies were introduced, like Peercoin which established the first proof of stake (PoS) consensus (although Peercoin also uses Proof-of-Work for important parts of its system). Primecoin pioneered a scientific computing proof-of-work system, and Bytecoin introduced the Cryptonote protocol for the first time. Following this, a wide range of different types of cryptographic value exchange methods were infused into cryptocurrencies like the X11 algorithm, proof-of-importance (PoI), the Quark algorithm, and the zerocash protocol. At the present time, there are 870+ digital tokens that are available to the public that can be found on an assortment of global cryptocurrency exchanges. The landscape of the highest valued digital assets is far different than it was in the early years. Now cryptocurrencies like Ethereum, Monero, Stratis, and Dash have been extremely profitable over the past year. Many of the market cap valuations for these digital assets are worth multi-millions and some of them billions, like bitcoin. Even older cryptocurrencies like Litecoin, Peercoin, Namecoin, and Feathercoin are still treasured assets. However the top twenty coins today are far different than they were during the first cryptocurrency craze of 2013. Now cryptocurrency markets are worth more than ever before, and the Ethereum economy has more than half of the market share Bitcoin has, as the digital asset is currently worth over $300 per ether. At the time of writing, one ether’s value has to climb to a little over $510 to overtake bitcoin’s market capitalization. For the first time in history, the chance of this happening is becoming more probable. Furthermore, a vast amount of newer coins and even tokens created with Ethereum have gained immense value this year as well. The fact is no one knows what’s going to happen to this growing environment of cryptocurrencies. Some believe it will continue to prosper and bitcoin and altcoins will become the new money of the future. While others believe only a few out of the hundreds of digital assets will survive, and some think bitcoin might not be one of them. Others believe that a broad range of altcoin valuations are in a bubble based on ICO fever and mere speculation on trading platforms. They think the bubble could pop at any moment, and it’s just matter of time when it does. All people can do is come up with their own cryptocurrency forecasts and try to tether that with present day information and data.    We currently can’t predict the outcome of how digital money will change society. However, we do know the way humans exchange value these days is clearly shifting directions, and bitcoin has pushed that envelope further. The environment bitcoin has produced brought about significant technical advances so far, and right now we seem to be witnessing the biggest transfer of wealth in decades. That’s a pretty amazing feat for a technology that’s less than ten years old, and it’s only going to get better. What do you think about the growth of cryptocurrencies and digital money in general?

Also Read: Increased South African Bitcoin Adoption Highlights Need For Taxation Clarity  Africa is well documented as the world’s region with the least developed banking sector and the most underbanked citizenry. Bitcoin has long been seen as a potential solution to this problem, and many wallet providers and remittance services have flourished in Africa. Following the success of BitPesa, Bitmari has been among the most successful bitcoin companies in Africa, offering wallet and remittance services to citizens in several different nations.  In addition to partnering with the Zimbabwe Bank of Agriculture, Bitmari has applied for an international remittance license with the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe. If successful, Bitmari will become the region’s first licensed international remittance business based upon bitcoin. Since being founded in 2015, Bitmari has generated great attention through its philanthropic programs designed to assist female farmers, and Bitmari’s staunch desire to use the blockchain as an instrument for political change. “We think technology is a better method of solving problems than politics”, co-founder Sinclair Skinner stated in a 2016 interview with Ebony Magazine. “Bitmari is utilizing the wisdom of Zimbabwe and the resources of Silicon Valley to build fintech applications that will change the speed and flexibility of transactions throughout Africa,” Bitmari co-founder Christopher Mapondera told reporters in a recent interview.  Bitmari is hoping to offer superior remittance services to Africa’s enormous agricultural sector, which currently incurs exorbitant fees in order send and receive money internationally and exchange between currencies. With Africa’s agricultural export industry accounting for approximately 50% percent of the region’s economic activity, being able to bypass the conventional banking system could allow African farmers and businesses to keep a significant additional percentage of profits. “Blockchain technology will allow Agribank and future indigenous African banks to leapfrog traditional remittance methods. Financial inclusion creates empowerment and ultimately stronger economies,” stated Skinner. Despite Bitmari’s moves towards partnering with mainstream African financial institutions, there is very little regulation pertaining to bitcoin or cryptocurrency established in Africa. Few nations have offered official guidelines for businesses to operate within, nor have proposals for government regulation been developed. This absence of regulatory guidelines may present future challenges to Bitmari, as it seeks to embed its services into the economies of nations who are yet to develop or consider regulations for cryptocurrency. With over $60 billion USD lost from the African economy due to remittance fees, bitcoin and blockchain technology are sure to play an increasingly significant role in Africa’s economy throughout 21st century.

2017-06-12T10:47:36-04:00,"Bitcoin Price Flips Downward After Almost Reaching $3,000",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-flips-downward-almost-reaching-3000/,"The price of bitcoin has been surging over the weekend almost touching $3000 per BTC on Sunday, June 11 across most global exchanges. The following day roughly around 6:30 am bitcoin’s price took a steep decline dropping to a low of $2700 but has since bounced back a touch after the dip. Also Read: Russian Government To Introduce KYC Guidelines For Cryptocurrency Purchases During the weekend throughout June 10-11 bitcoin’s price seemed to be forming a strong consolidation in the $2970-2980 range. It tried to cross the $3000 mark multiple times (it did on a couple of exchanges) with little success as the price per BTC topped a high of $2980 on the trading platform Bitstamp. After that, the June 12th morning dip seemed rather unexpected and looked to be merely some profit-taking for the time being. At press time the price has rebounded and is sitting roughly around the $2775 mark.  One of the most topical discussions at the moment is the market capitalization of Ethereum (ETH) and the possibility of it surpassing bitcoin’s market cap. Ethereum had a pretty good weekend jumping from $300 to $420 across most exchanges. This has led to the ethereum market capturing roughly 78 percent of bitcoin’s valuation in what a lot of people are referring to as the ‘flippening.’ Currently as far as a flippening is concerned ethereum has already surpassed bitcoin trade volumes, mining reward and even 24-hour transaction volume. As of right now, ETH market dominance is 32 percent, and BTC is 40 percent among the 870 cryptocurrencies in existence. Looking at the charts on Bitstamp bitcoin’s price is trying to regain ground at the moment. Technical indicators are showing the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still above the 200 SMA — which is a good sign showing the gap may indicate more bullish trends in the future. Right now order books on Bitstamp are moving faster than the eye can catch but there are big sell walls in the 2850 range and there are even larger walls above this mark. Both the Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) levels show a healthy correction was due and bulls will remain on the sidelines for better entry points. It’s safe to assume Bitcoin trading markets will be quite volatile over the next 24-hours and day traders, and intra-range players should have a field day scalping profits. Overall things have been quite positive within the cryptocurrency space, and the correction has taken place across most crypto-markets after a few digital assets touched all-time highs. Mainstream media is reporting about bitcoin’s rising price but are also speculating on the performance of ethereum markets. The likelihood of bitcoin breaking the $3000 range and finding new highs is not out of the question, as we’ve seen corrections like this on multiple times over the past two months. Alongside this, at the token’s current rate of growth, the possibility of Ethereum experiencing a larger market capitalization than bitcoin is also a possibility. Bear Scenario: The price of bitcoin has dipped quite a bit since the June 11 high to a low of $2700. At the moment bears seem like they are having a hard time pulling down the price further but it’s possible they could bring BTC down to the $2600 range. At the moment there is a strong foundation between $2600-2700, but the price could go lower if psychological patterns cause panic. Bull Scenario: Bitcoin’s price looks as though it just received a healthy correction and bulls have possibly pulled the elastic back once again to set up for the next spring upwards. The price per BTC could easily break the $3000 mark, as we’ve seen after every correction there have been higher follow-ups in price. Trade volume is healthy with over $2 billion worth of BTC traded daily, and higher price points are achievable even in the short term.

2017-06-12T01:37:29-04:00,Bitcoin Mines in Chinese Province Sichuan Allegedly Forced to Shut Down,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mines-in-chinese-province-sichuan-allegedly-forced-to-shut-down/,"Reports have emerged detailing the alleged forceful cessation of large-scale bitcoin mines in China’s southwest, with insiders quoting a lack of state-sanctioned regulatory policy regarding cryptocurrency mining as the official reasoning cited for such. Also Read: Russian Government To Introduce KYC Guidelines For Cryptocurrency Purchases The absence of government-backed regulation over the practice of bitcoin mining has apparently prompted the Chinese central government to forcefully influence the cessation of many commercial bitcoin mining operations in Sichuan. China’s province of Sichuan has attracted great interest from bitcoin investors and entrepreneurs in recent years, as the province has abundant access to hydropower and offers huge savings in electricity costs for mining businesses that operate in Sichuan.  The closures come at a critical moment for mining businesses, as Bitcoin’s price has tripled over the course of 2017. “The price is so high at the moment,” said a bitcoin mine manager in an interview with Yicai Global, “shutting down costs mine owners hundreds of thousands of yuan every day.” The reports appear at odds with the Chinese government’s recent to decision to again allow deposits and withdrawals in fiat currencies to be processed by the country’s major exchanges. The moves come ahead of announcements that The People’s Bank of China will roll out regulatory measures for bitcoin trading designed to prevent money laundering in June. “Bitcoin regulation that the central bank conducted mainly focused on financing and leveraging trading among platforms,” Zhang Jun, a senior analyst at Tai Cloud Research Institute, told Yicai Global. Sichuan officials echoed this sentiment, also stating that “mining is carried out by companies of their own accord” – implying that mining businesses have taken it upon themselves to act outside of the legal apparatus provided by the Chinese government. The move by China to regulate cryptocurrency trading but crack down on mining appears contradictory at first, but closer analysis of the marxist principles that underpinned the origins of the Chinese central government’s economic policies illuminate a logic to adopting these positions. For China, a regulated bitcoin trading industry will generate wealth that will be under the control of the Chinese state. The industry will be under the control of the central government, and investors would predominantely represent individuals who are already living in cities that are integrated into the contemporary Chinese state-capitalist societal mode.  Mining, on the other hand, will likely flourish in areas such as Sichuan, provinces outside of the major Chinese economic center that are yet to be fully developed and integrated into the contemporary Chinese economy, that can also offer investors abundant access to cheap electricity. This could pose great challenges to China’s attempt to further develop and centralize the vast populations that exist outside of China’s developed core, as greater access to blockchain technology could facilitate the emergence of a myriad of localized, informal economies operating outside of the control of the Chinese government. For a state whose legitimacy and existence depends upon delivering services with the greatest possible efficiency through the use of a centralized state apparatus, the risk of the economic liberation and autonomy made possible of bitcoin penetrating those provinces that are more autonomously governed is a threat that will be taken seriously. The move toward holding two seemingly contradictory stances is likely to be indicative of future stances held by the Chinese government regarding cryptocurrency. It is very likely that the government will seek to guide those components of the cryptocurrency industry that will adapt well to China’s current economic landscape and regulation. This while forcefully restricting the development of the components of the cryptocurrency economy that may undermine China’s ability to centralize and control the economies of the entire Chinese landmass. Do you think Chinese regulators will be able to prohibit commercial mining operations, or do you think the Chinese bitcoin mining industry will continue to operate underground?  Tell us your thought below!

2017-06-11T19:00:57-04:00,As Bitcoin’s Price Rises Security Shouldn’t Be Taken for Granted,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-price-rises-security/,"Recently there have been numerous reports of people losing their bitcoins to hackers and malware as bitcoin’s price continues to grow in value. It is safe to assume that organizations and individuals trying to steal people’s bitcoin reserves will persistently increase because the decentralized cryptocurrency becomes more valuable to thieves. Also read: Rising Network Fees Are Causing Changes Within the Bitcoin Economy At the time of writing one bitcoin is worth roughly $2900 as it has become a treasured digital asset. While bitcoin’s value has increased the number of people losing money to malware attacks and hackers cracking bitcoin accounts usually follows the price rise in unison. Just recently Cody Brown, founder of the virtual reality community Roomscale.org, lost $8000 worth of bitcoin held on Coinbase. Brown’s attack vector was through Verizon where the hacker easily took over his cell phone number with a some “simple billing information.” After his phone was compromised the attacker swiped his Coinbase funds in less than fifteen minutes. Brown does detail that he did not use two-factor authentication with his email account, but feels that it shouldn’t be so easy to access Verizon information. He also believes that he may have been targeted after tweeting about bitcoin a week prior. “The main thing that struck me by the hack was the extraction speed possible in the current cryptocurrency ecosystem,” explains Brown’s testimony.   Another story this past week comes from India, as a Bengaluru techie lost his funds due to his Unocoin account being compromised. The Indian bitcoin trader says he used Google Authenticator on his Gmail account and his phone wasn’t compromised. “The hack seems to have happened on the Unocoin server where both the password reset link and OTP are generated,” explained Makrand the Bengaluru techie. Makrand says he lost 120,000 INR worth of bitcoin or roughly US$1850 at the time of writing. On June 6 a Reddit user detailed he lost 13 BTC or around $36,000 because of malware that changes a bitcoin address after you copy and paste it to send. The malware replaces the address on the clipboard with an address owned by the thieves. According to the publication, Naked Security by Sophos, “Pastejacking with Javascript” malware has been around for quite some time. The Reddit user details his horrifying experience of losing 36 grand in minutes due to this type of malicious software, saying;   A few days later another Reddit user tried to send funds to Poloniex and lost his money due to cut and paste malware.   “So I just lost $150 USD in BTC by transferring them to an address that was inserted on the Poloniex balances page,” the post’s author details on June 8. “Dumb @$$ me just copied the address and pasted it into Coinbase to transfer, and now it’s gone. According to blockchain.info, looks like they have scammed a bunch more folks.” All of these stories took place within the last three weeks as bitcoin’s value has climbed higher. Although negative, these stories may increase more awareness for people forgetting to take better security measures. For instance using two-factor authentication (2FA) should definitely be used on exchanges but alongside that the email used for these exchanges should also be protected with 2FA. Furthermore, talking about where you hold your bitcoin online is also not the best idea as many hackers use social engineering tactics to compromise your funds. Additionally, a lot of people use the cut and paste clipboard software to copy addresses, but people should always cross-examine the copied address with the receiving address on the screen. Bitcoin’s price rise is great but also reminds us all that we have to keep our bitcoin safe in a secure fashion or suffer a significant financial loss in a matter of minutes.

Also read: Considering Bitcoin An Asset Could Set Back Adoption in Israel The Tel Aviv district court reportedly ruled last week against Israeli bitcoin exchange Bits of Gold in favor of Bank Leumi, the country’s second largest bank by total assets. The case was brought to court by the Tel Aviv-based exchange after it was denied service by the bank. The proceedings followed an incident in which the bank claimed “hackers broke into its accounts in order to send funds from the bank to buy bitcoins,” it told the court. Bits of Gold assisted the bank with the investigations but there was no indication that it was involved in any way, the court learned. Nonetheless, Bank Leumi told the court that its own cybersecurity issues warranted cause to stop offering banking services to the exchange. It was shown in court that Bits of Gold had followed all AML and KYC procedures, which included reporting all transactions larger than a certain amount to the authorities as required by the Israeli law. However, Bank Leumi still claimed that the nature of cryptocurrency renders its AML requirements inadequate since it cannot know whom the end receiver of the cryptocurrency is. The bank told the court that it fears how criminal organizations can send their “monkeys” to buy bitcoins and transfer them to wallets under their control. Monkeys are “low level people under their control who will never testify against the masterminds,” Finance Magnates explained. The publication relayed the bank’s concern: While praising Bits of Gold for its transparency and compliance operations, the court ruled that Bank Leumi can decide to deny service to it. Bits of Gold has been providing bitcoin exchange services since 2013. Users can buy bitcoin using bank transfers, credit cards, or cash. At press time, bank transfers is still an option listed on the company’s website. Cash purchases are made through the GMT transfer network and they take about three minutes to complete. GMT operates through a vast number of banks and money transfer operators worldwide. Customers can open an order on the Bits of Gold website, then go to one of the locations to deposit money. Alternatively, they can use the Bitcoin ATM located at the Bitcoin Embassy in Tel Aviv, Bits of Gold CEO Yuval Roash explained to The Marker, a local publication. He said that his company has gone through great lengths to give their full cooperation to the regulators. For example, customers with transactions larger than 50,000 shekels, worth about $14,156 USD, are required by regulators to visit the company’s office and fill out paperwork for the Money Laundering Prohibition Authority in person. “This is a bit unusual in the Bitcoin market, but we try to cooperate with the regulator and integrate into the world of finance,” he detailed, adding that: Do you think banks should be able to deny service to Bitcoin businesses?

Most hedge fund managers have stayed away from bitcoin. However, the few that have included it are significantly outperforming their peers. Also read: Bitcoin Bubble? Analysis Suggests More Room to Grow Hedge funds are investment funds whose clients are accredited or institutional investors. They are less regulated than mutual funds since they are not subject to strict rules designed to protect investors. Some of them are not even required to register or file public reports with financial regulators. Investments in hedge funds are only restricted by each fund’s mandate. They can effectively be anything including land, real estate and currencies, as long as they seek to maximize investors’ returns while reducing risks. The comprehensive overall returns of hedge funds are measured by the hedge fund absolute return index (HFRX), which is representative of all hedge fund strategies. Hedge Fund Research (HFR), which provides data on more than 150 hedge fund indices, is the industry’s leading provider of hedge fund index data. According to HFR, the HFRI Weighted Composite Index only returned 0.46% in May and 3.5% year-to-date. In comparison, the S&P500 total return was 1.16% in May and 9.61% year-to-date.  HFR’s data reveals that most hedge fund strategies underperformed the market both in May and year-to-date, CNBC reported. The index provider noted that technology and currencies were the only two strategies that performed well in both time periods, adding that: The hedge funds that do invest in bitcoin currently do not have large positions. The best performing hedge fund index in May was the HFRI Macro Currency Index which gained 3.49% in the month and 8.22% year-to-date. “In addition to contributions from Euro, Swiss Franc, New Zealand Dollar and Korean Won, the Currency Index also had strong contributions from exposure to digital currencies,” according to the HFR report. “Many hedge funds are still very reluctant to dip a toe into the asset class,” CNBC recently reported. One hedge fund veteran, with 16 years of experience, told the news outlet: The reasons hedge funds are reluctant to invest in bitcoin “really boils down to concerns over volatility, security and perception,” Louis Gargour, the founder of asset manager LNG Capital, told the publication. He listed three concerns. Firstly, “bitcoin’s extreme volatility doesn’t sit well with managers working on a risk-adjusted return basis.” Secondly, fund managers are concerned with the digital currency being hacked or stolen. Lastly, “there’s a perception that bitcoin remains a niche, retail investment that does not yet demonstrate sufficient quality to be seriously considered for many reputable institutions,” he explained. However, as bitcoin continues to outperform other asset classes, more hedge fund managers may start following their peers and invest in the digital currency. At press time, Bitstamp shows that bitcoin has gained over 180% so far this year and over 70% in May. Do you think more hedge funds will invest in bitcoin soon?

2017-06-10T06:00:56-04:00,US Lawmakers Urged to Take Action Against Unlicensed Offshore Bitcoin Exchanges,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/us-lawmakers-urged-to-take-action-against-unlicensed-offshore-bitcoin-exchanges/,"US lawmakers have been urged to take action against unlicensed offshore bitcoin exchanges, following a subcommittee hearing within the House of Representatives. The hearing, “Virtual Currency: Financial Innovation and National Security Implications”, is being hosted by the Terrorism and Illicit Finance Subcommittee. Also Read: Financial Analyst Andy Hoffman Says We Should Be Thankful for Bitcoin The growing proliferation of ransomware attacks that utilize cryptocurrency technology has led US lawmakers to again focus upon the potential negative use cases for blockchain technology. Representatives were told that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies being increasingly used to fuel illicit activities are easily accessible via unregulated cryptocurrencies hosted outside of the United States. An emphasis was placed upon unlicensed exchanges being used as a vehicle for money laundering, terrorism, and cybercrime.    The absence of KYC guidelines and identity verification on many exchanges were stressed as a major issue. “Criminals can open anonymous accounts, or accounts with phony names to fly under the radar of law enforcement,” said Kathryn Haun, former Assistant US Attorney and current lecturer at Stanford University. “Thus, we have received ‘Mickey Mouse who resides at ‘123 Main Street’ in subpoena returns”. The US House Financial Services Committee hearing has taken place just months after the FBI was granted legal jurisdiction to hack any computer in the world that is deemed to be connected via a ‘network’ to a computer for which the FBI has a warrant authorization infiltration. This prompts some to interpret the rhetoric as a possible pre-meditated justification for considering using said jurisdiction to clamp down on unregulated bitcoin transactions internationally. “We must find a way to target these criminal currency exchanges, often sheltered in countries where officials protect and even profit from them”, said Scott Dueweke, president of The Identity and Payments Association.  Democratic Representative Ed Permutter of Colorado recognized the widespread use of cash and money transmitting services as also being vehicles for illicit activities, but argued that law enforcement possesses the regulatory means to prosecute and punish those who use such to break the law. Many of the issues raised have little evidence supporting the need for a greater focus on crimes committed involving cryptocurrency, than for crimes committed using dollars. There is scant evidence that more than $1,000 has been donated to terrorist groups using bitcoin, and the anonymizing capabilities of the technology are often overstated. The public nature of all blockchain wallet values makes it easy for law enforcement to track the movements of funds identified to have been involved with criminal activities – an overt downside of attempting to use bitcoin as a vehicle for nefarious activities. It is also worth noting that many hackers and scammers have had their funds seized by exchanges when attempting to convert their cryptocurrency into fiat (including the shadowy and anonymously operated BTC-E) – suggesting that the cryptocurrency network possesses some internal means to alienate and punish those who seek to use bitcoin for clandestine purposes.

This is exactly the pivot Norwegian investor Kristoffer Hansen made. He sold all his stock shares and bought up bitcoin. This move landed him on Friday’s cover of the national newspaper, Dagens Næringsliv.  Also read: Sweden Sees Record Trading Volume as MP Sundin Joins Bitcoin Exchange BTCX The paper said that Hansen has been following cryptocurrencies for several years prior to finally putting everything in. A recent publication read, “IT consultant/advisor Kristoffer Hansen from Trondheim has followed digital currencies for five years, and thinks we’re not near the top.” The article quoted him, saying, “I’ve gone all-in and sold all stocks and put it all into bitcoin.” These types of investor pivot arcs seem to be taking formidable shape as the price indicators for bitcoin continue to point skyward. The market seems to be signaling for a bullish run, and more people like Hansen may continue going “all in” in order to obtain wealth as a result of the digital gold boom.  “Digital gold boom” is the most concrete way to portray the current environment. The bitcoin ecosystem appears fattened and invigorated by investor initiatives and individuals looking to adopt and use the currency. However, no one can surmise the true nature of the market course. Nonetheless, interested parties across the globe are starting to eye bitcoin with a near-voracious appetite. This has all happened in a kind of snowball effect after Japan started accepting bitcoin as a currency within the country. The Moscow Times even ran a beautiful cover piece of bitcoin in a recent edition, indicating their country may head boldly into the direction of crypto adoption. This comes as Russian bankers and heads of State have instigated talks about cryptocurrency use cases and regulations within the country. Bitcoin.com covered the topic, saying, If countries and businesses and individuals continue to celebrate Bitcoin en masse, it will certainly jar more investors like Hansen into making a similar pivot and embrace the bull ride of the bitcoin boom.

2017-06-09T19:00:51-04:00,Bitcoin Bubble? Analysis Suggests More Room to Grow,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-bubble-analysis/,"With all the media attention and the skyrocketing price of bitcoin of late, it is common to hear that bitcoin is in a bubble. However, some analysts disagree, offering reasons why the digital currency has more room to grow. Also read: Are Asian Markets Creating a Bitcoin Price Bubble? As the price of bitcoin surged over 180% this year, some speculate that the digital currency is in a bubble. Earlier this week, Shark Tank star and billionaire Mark Cuban gave his opinion of bitcoin’s price. “I think it’s in a bubble. I just don’t know when or how much it corrects,” he tweeted. Last month, Bitcoin.com reported on Charles Hayter, CEO and founder of the cryptocurrency data analysis firm Crypto Compare, calling the Asian bitcoin price rise a bubble. As the price of bitcoin climbed higher in Asia than most western exchanges, Hayter said he “believes the increase is a bubble formation but questions the level of speculation.” In an article published by Market Watch on Thursday, ARK Invest’s blockchain analyst Chris Burniske explained why the “rally still has room to grow,” the publication wrote. Burniske used a modified price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio method which he helped develop. “The reason I call it a P/E ratio is because when I think about what a P/E signifies for equities, it is basically the function of market cap and earnings,” he said. “The earnings are the underlying utility—the cash flow of the company.” From it, he derived a healthy outlook. “Bitcoin’s ‘P/E ratio’ looks at the digital currency’s network value—the number of outstanding bitcoins multiplied by price,” he calculated. “This figure is currently $44.69 billion—against its daily transaction volume,” the article explained. Burniske’s metric currently gives bitcoin a P/E ratio of roughly 50. He told the publication: Financial blogger and author Charles Hugh Smith recently offered three key reasons why bitcoin is not in a bubble, Market Watch reported. Smith’s popular blog oftwominds.com is #7 on CNBC’s top alternative financial sites. His articles are often republished on other popular blogs including Zero Hedge, the Mises Institute, Financial Sense, and Peak Prosperity. Firstly, Smith said bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “have utility value,” unlike Beanie Babies. There are many uses of bitcoin such as to facilitate international payments for goods and services. Secondly, bitcoin is not a scam. A scam would advertise a too-good-to-be-true product where sellers know “the product is garbage” but buyers were led to believe the opposite, Smith explained. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has transparent rules for exchanging currency and both buyers and sellers know exactly what to expect. Thirdly, even with the rising number of investors, they still represent just a fraction of the total number of potential investors. He noted how very few people he knows have actually invested in bitcoin. “When only one of your circle of acquaintances, colleagues, friends, neighbors and extended family own an asset, there is no way that asset [bitcoin] can be in a bubble,” he believes, adding that: Do you think bitcoin is in a bubble?

2017-06-09T13:00:39-04:00,Rising Network Fees Are Causing Changes Within the Bitcoin Economy,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/fees-causing-changes-bitcoin-economy/,"Bitcoin’s value has grown significantly this year making people’s digital asset holdings worth quite a bit these days. Alongside this, bitcoin mining fees have swelled almost in unison with the price rise and some people have been paying an average of $3-4 per transaction. The rising fees continue to cause concern for bitcoin proponents and businesses using the digital currency for daily operations. Also read: Bitcoin Markets Increasingly Reflect Global Transition Towards ‘The Asian Century’ The price of bitcoin had jumped to a record high the other day surpassing US$2900 per BTC across global exchanges, and is hovering at $2800 at press time. As the price has climbed over the past couple of months the number of transactions taking place on the network has also increased as the mempool has filled to over 200,000 unconfirmed transactions at times. For some perspective just a few months ago during the weekends, the mempool used to drop to 5,000 to 12,000 unconfirmed transactions. The current congestion has led to significantly sized fees across the network so people can get their transactions settled quicker. Now bitcoin-focused businesses are pivoting away from using bitcoin for their services or are having customers pay the higher fees. Bitcoin.com has reported on well-known companies such as Coinbase, Xapo, and Bitpay telling their users they can no longer pay the fees themselves. Since then there have been many other startups that have had to pivot their business model due to the rising network fees. Kraken announced on June 8 it was raising its bitcoin withdrawal fees to (0.0025BTC or $7 USD) due to increasing network fees. “Kraken always pays a miner fee that is sufficient to ensure transactions are processed quickly,” explains the San Francisco-based exchange via email. “However, the average miner fee required to prioritize and confirm Bitcoin transactions has been increasing for some time without a corresponding increase in the fee we charge to clients. The update brings the withdrawal fee more in line with our cost for the miner fees.” Another startup based in Ireland called Bitcart, a service that provides discount gift cards for bitcoin has also revealed some bad news for bitcoiners. The company has recently announced it will soon be disabling bitcoin from its interface and will accept Dash instead. Once again the decision is based on transaction congestion and rising miner fees the company details. “From a merchant’s point of view, bitcoin is extremely problematic,” says Bitcart CEO, Graham de Barra. Of course, the subject of rising fees has led to discussing the scaling debate more frequently. One side blames people for blocking Segregated Witness while the other side is upset the block size of 1MB has not yet been increased. There are many heavily disputed debates happening right now across bitcoin forums, Facebook, Twitter, and other social mediums. In parallel with these never ending arguments many startups continue to announce that they are focusing on altcoins over bitcoin. The remittance app Wyre has revealed it will now be using ethereum due to lower fees, the social network startup Yours detailed the platform will be utilizing litecoin, and the highly anticipated Brave browser who once championed bitcoin has also switched to ethereum. Bitcoin proponents think that if something isn’t fixed soon, the decentralized currency’s network effect will slowly lose its position. Many of the people who believe this are concerned that bitcoin is seemingly becoming less attractive to killer app ideas that use microtransactions or deal with cross-border remittances. Some now say the infamous bitcoin outperforming Western Union meme does not apply to bitcoin anymore. Even the Prague-based Crypto-Anarchy Institute, Paralelní Polis, is recommending litecoin now over bitcoin. “We will still accept bitcoin, but we can no longer recommend it as a payment system, it’s more of a store of value,” explains the announcement from Paralelní Polis. It’s getting difficult to ignore the fee market changing the bitcoin environment and economy, but at the moment there is no clear answer to how these problems will be solved.

Also Read: ETF Blues? Check These Alternative Exchange-Traded Bitcoin-Backed Instruments Swedish Bitcoin trading volume on localbitcoins has doubled in recent weeks, following news of Mathias Sundin’s transition from the political arena to the position of Chairman of the Board at BTCX.  Mathias Sundin made history in 2014 by becoming the world’s first elected politician to exclusively accept campaign donations in the form of Bitcoin, and has been credited with contributing to the highly liberal regulatory approach to Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies that Sweden currently maintains. In 2016 Sweden joined the many countries that say they are looking into how to develop their own cryptocurrencies, the exact applications for which have yet to be determined, and earlier this year news emerged that Sweden is testing out blockchain technology as means to secure land title registry records. The surge in localbitcoins trading volume can be interpreted as evidence of a large uptake in Swedish bitcoin adoption, as trading via localbitcoins incurs heavier fees than on exchanges, and thus represents a depiction of the userbase citizens who are likely to be outside of the trading community. The rapid rise in trading volume has been attributed to Sundin’s move to BTCX, whose success as an MP garnered great attention and validation of bitcoin throughout Swedish society. BTCX’s customer base has shown recent consistent growth of over 1,000 users each month, and Sundin hopes to accelerate growth through greater cooperation with the country’s mainstream financial institutions. For Sundin, BTCX has a unique opportunity to “show the banks and everyone else that they’re following every regulation… we’re doing everything by the book here, and there’s nothing fishy going on.”  Further cooperation between the bitcoin industry and Sweden’s mainstream financial institutions will make Sweden one of the most advanced nations when it comes to fostering growth and investment in the cryptocurrency economy. Bitcoin is a legal means of payment in Sweden and is currently classified as a ‘capital investment object’, with capital gains taxation charged on realised gains in value, and standard taxation applied to the dollar value of bitcoins when used in the form of commercial transactions. There’s also two exchange-traded notes (ETNs) pegged to the price of Bitcoin that are traded on the NASDAQ OMX in Sweden.

Also read: Bitcoin Price Skyrockets — Touches $2860 Across Global Exchanges Indospace.io is the first online payment solution that incorporates a dispensary’s updated menu with a bitcoin checkout. The company is a white label bitcoin payment platform that serves marijuana dispensaries and their customers throughout the U.S. and in Canada. They allow individual dispensaries (and those with multiple locations) to register and login using two-factor authentication (2FA) to claim their business and establish certain selling criteria including: sales tax, delivery fees, delivery radius, employees and a minimum order amount among others. Following the procedure, the dispensary can then save their settings and immediately open their online menu and bitcoin checkout cart. Each order received will be processed at a 3.5% fee with the balance automatically applied to their wallet supplied by Indospace. We chatted with Mr. Nahin to get some insight into the Indospace project and how bitcoin is used for cannabis purchases. Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers how you came up with your business model connecting dispensaries with bitcoin? Justin Nahin (JN): I’ve known about Cannabis banking problems for quite some time, cash only and ATM machines are present at most dispensaries. Bitcoin seemed to be a great fit for the industry, and after extensively researching the topic I found numerous articles that strongly supported my personal assessment. I discovered that there were already a few dispensaries accepting bitcoin as one method of payment, which gave me the confidence to pursue the last ten months in developing this business. I thought that there must be plenty of other dispensaries wanting to accept bitcoin as well, but quickly discovered that there was a multitude of existing technical hurdles. Most businesses found them insurmountable and simply quit. Realizing that there had to be a better way, I decided to build a web platform that put everything into one neat little package. BC: Have you worked with any dispensaries so far helping them integrate their menu? JN: The company launched Sunday, June 4, 2017. Our initial campaign reaches out to specific retailers showing them a preview of their menus and a recap of benefits. BC: Can any state that has legal cannabis dispensaries use this platform? JN: Yes, any dispensary in any state that has successfully registered with Indospace can immediately engage in ecommerce. BC: Can you tell our readers how bitcoin is used for a transaction? JN: The process starts when a user lands on a dispensary menu page by way of an organic search or by clicking a direct link placed on social media pages. A popup confirms the necessary requirements to proceed with an online order, such as requiring an MMJ medical license, age status, location and obtaining enough bitcoin to complete their transaction. Bitcoin primarily is acquired through top exchanges such as Coinbase or Indacoin. Coinbase is currently the best exchange in the United States, according to numerous sources. They provide an intuitive interface and a history of fast transactions by way of debit/credit card and bank account transfers. Once users purchase bitcoin, it is either parked at the exchange in a user wallet or sent to another wallet that the owner specifies with a bitcoin address. There is also a “pay with your wallet” option that is similar to clicking on a “mailto” link in a browser, which launches the default email program on the users’ device. The application launches the amount due and destination payment address “prefilled,” allowing for an effortless transaction. BC: What’s the overall mission for Indospace? JN: The mission of Indospace.io is to engage every legal cannabis dispensary in the U.S. and Canada to incorporate bitcoin into their cash management strategy using our comprehensive ecommerce automated menu and checkout system. Do you think more dispensaries will accept bitcoin going forward? Let us know in the comments section below.

Also Read: Garza Fined $12 Million by SEC for GAW Mining and Zenmining Ponzi Schemes Earlier this week New Zealand news outlet Newshub warned citizens against the pyramid scheme ‘We Grow Bitcoins’, which has attracted investments from over 1300 members internationally.  We Grow Bitcoins encourages users to make a ‘donation’ of 0.01BTC and sign up 5 additional members to the company, each of whom ‘donate’ 0.01BTC to the referrer. Users are then encouraged to sign up more users and donate larger sums in exchange for promised monthly returns of up to 62 BTC. Predictably, members never see the promised returns and are left with the shame of having signed up others to the scam. We Grow Bitcoins’ business model is not unique. The unfortunate penetration of Multi-Level-Marketing scams into the cryptocurrency sphere has seen many of these fraudulent pyramid schemes attempting to lure inexperienced cryptocurrency users – with Ethereum Project being amongst the most recent to surface. Ethereum Project makes unverified claims of association with Choice Humanitarian – a charitable organization whose primary mission is to provide greater funding and resources to communities in the developing world struggling to tackle issues of malnutrition, potable drinking water, underdeveloped educational and health-care facilities and infrastructure. Ethereum Project claims that a portion of all ‘donations’ will go to Choice Humanitarian, an unlikely claim designed to foster an illusion of philanthropy. Underneath the veneer of charity, Ethereum Project is a generic MLM pyramid scheme that entices users with unrealistic potential returns in exchange for affiliate sign-ups, stimulating their victim’s appetite for greed before relieving them of their coiffures. Also, according to recent online accounts, the web domain ethereumchamber.net has been used to steal the private keys of unsuspecting customers. After the scam was revealed the site started hosting the official music video for Juicy J’s ‘Blue Bentley’ single – an apparent jest at those who fell victim to the malicious fraud. Ethereumchamber has disappeared as quickly as it emerged, following a brief wave of sponsored publicity hosted on many leading Bitcoin and cryptocurrency media outlets, blogs, and websites. Rumors of the scam first emerged from MyEtherWallet.com, who tweeted stating “CONFIRMED: Ethereum Chamber is stealing your private keys. DO NOT USE”. Ethereum news website ethnews.com contacted Ethereumchamber regarding the allegations in recent days, only to receive the following response – “Theft is illegal. We don’t condone illegal activities. Lol” Unfortunately their press release slipped through also news.Bitcoin.com:s strict vetting system due to an internal misunderstanding, and was published among other press releases for about 42 minutes before the mistake was noticed, and the press release was immediately retracted. Most sites and projects get their share of scam accusations, whether true or not. Still, mishaps like these are very rare at Bitcoin.com, but they are part of the reason press relases include a disclaimer. It reads; “This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements, and should be treated as advertising or promotional material.

The recent heightened mainstream media exposure of Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies has inevitably attracted the attention of conmen, in addition to new users.

During the interview, Hoffman talked about the rise of cryptocurrencies and why he thinks bitcoin might be a game changer for the world. Also read: Japan’s Bitpoint to Add Bitcoin Payments to 100,000+ Stores  Andy Hoffman is a well-known financial analyst who believes the global economy is suffering from a significant depression with exponential debt. Hoffman details it’s difficult for the public to see these facts due to the stock market and other manipulated markets continuing to rise. “They have created ‘Dotcom valuations’ in an increasingly ‘Great Depression’ era, which, by the way, are only being enjoyed by 1% of the population,” explains Hoffman. Hoffman extensively discusses why he thinks precious metals are an excellent hedge against the current economic downturn taking place across the globe. Following his statements about precious metal markets, the analyst talks about cryptocurrencies and their recent rise in valuation over the past year. Hoffman says he is “bullish” about bitcoin but believes cryptocurrencies are still very young and “wildly volatile.” “As bullish as I am about bitcoin — Look they are in the middle of their scaling debate right now — They are going to have to go through the wars with the governments. Once the governments start to worry, like when the Chinese instituted capital controls on bitcoin back in January. They failed, but they can institute other ones. The U.S. could come in and say we are gonna ban it or shut down Coinbase and do all kinds of things to scare people.” Hoffman continues to explain that these battles with the powers that be will make bitcoin volatile for the time being. One thing Hoffman notes is that it’s misleading when people say there is no “intrinsic value” in regards to bitcoin. Even though cryptocurrencies have a lot of risks right now the analyst goes on to detail that precious metals and bitcoin are on the same team. “I wrote an article last May — ‘Precious Metals and Bitcoin: Twin Destroyers of the Fiat Regime,’ where I said they are allies. So when you have people on the precious metals side talking down about bitcoin 99 percent of them have no clue what they are talking about. They have done no research, they just view it as a competitor, and if they say bitcoin is bad it’ll go away, and everyone will ignore it.” For instance, Hoffman highlights the fact that the authorities can’t confiscate bitcoin from those who are smart enough to hold their funds on hardware wallets. However, with all the focus on bitcoin from the media and its current rise in popularity, the governments will feel threatened. In fact, Hoffman believes because of the focus on cryptocurrencies it will help push up the value of precious metals markets as well. “Bitcoin is going to weaken their defenses against gold and silver,” Hoffman explains. As far as alternative cryptocurrencies are concerned Hoffman says there will be a “tremendous amount of losers because a lot of them are scams, and a lot of them are just attracting hot money.” “So, you better do your research — The only one I have any faith in is bitcoin because it is the only one that can be a game changer for the world and the gold and silver market,” Hoffman concludes in his interview.

Meanwhile, some Parliament members are working towards cracking down on illegal activities involving the digital currency. Bitcoin.com spoke with Sandeep Goenka, co-founder of the leading Indian bitcoin broker Zebpay, to find out more about the situation in his country. Also read: India’s Government Divided Over Bitcoin Legalization The Indian Ministry of Corporate Affairs is responsible for implementing companies law. It has recently instructed the Serious Fraud Investigation Office (SFIO), regional directors, and the Registrar of Companies “to gather details about firms involved in bitcoin dealings,” reports the Economic Times, India’s leading business newspaper. The communication was sent by the ministry to Lok Sabha MP and BJP leader Kirit Somaiya who has raised concerns about “illegal exchange and trading of bitcoins in the country,” according to the publication. The government is concerned over risks associated with digital currencies and “the possibility of them being used to dupe investors.” The authorities have been instructed to focus on investors, depositors, the public and stakeholders who may be adversely affected and companies that may be using bitcoin “to lure the gullible public in collecting funds,” the publication details. The government’s efforts could be primarily aimed at pyramid schemes, rather than legitimate bitcoin exchanges and businesses. “There are 1-2 pyramid schemes which market themselves as Bitcoin mining in India,” Goenka told Bitcoin.com. “I think Mr. Somaiya’s intentions are well meaning in the sense that he might have got news regarding pyramid schemes disguised as Bitcoin mining,” Goenka described. “Unfortunately the good intention has been confused with the technology,” he noted, adding that: Bitcoin.com reported on the Indian government forming a committee in April. The committee “is currently studying this industry and might give recommendations to the government in June / July,” Goenka said, adding that: Meanwhile, bitcoin trading in India has been growing significantly. Last month, Zebpay announced that it had reached a milestone of over 500,000 app downloads, with more than 2,500 users added daily. On the peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange Localbitcoins, trading volumes in India’s rupee hit record highs last week.

He said, “After nearly three years of trying to get virtual currency explicitly exempt from money transmitter laws in the Live Free or Die State, I am happy to see this first major obstacle cleared.” The first major obstacle is cleared, true, but it was not cleared without overcoming past mishaps. Back in 2015, a bill was pushed through New Hampshire’s house that added bitcoin to the “money transmitter” status. Freeman mentioned the crypto enthusiasts of New Hampshire were not prepared for this anti-bitcoin legislation. So a committee to examine cryptocurrency was put together. The results of the committee’s work along with the crypto community appear to be this new bill that protects people and businesses who use cryptocurrency. It requires motivated work to turn bad bills like this around, though; and it looks like other states may need similar goading to keep hamstringing legislation from being signed into law. The same can be said about federal government legislation. Wendy McElroy, writing for bitcoin.com, recently wrote a piece condemning senate bill 1241, which she decried as being intended to undermine bitcoin freedom. She said, Then there are other anti-bitcoin or cryptocurrency bills that do similar things to undermine the currency. This includes the original New York “bitlicense” and the more recent anti-money laundering bill in Florida that seeks to attack bitcoin traders for the purposes of “safety” and “security.” The writers of this type of legislation suggest that they are protecting people from criminality, but many say they are only limiting or undermining personal freedom. Needless to say, New Hampshire’s turnaround bill represents a step in the right direction for most crypto enthusiasts. This bill comes into play at about the same time Nevada’s pro-crypto senate bill 398 has been passed into law. Nevada’s bill prohibits local politicians from taxing and regulating the digital currency, which sits in the same vein of thought as New Hampshire’s piece of legislation. Still, no one can claim to know what the future holds in terms of how governments will deal with digital currency, but there is certainly a tug-of-war going on between people who see it as evil and those who see it as good. Hopefully, more and more people will begin to realize the benefits of cryptocurrency rather than demonizing it and engaging in witch hunts.

What’s interesting about the job initiative is the $416,000 of stimulus funding that will go to a bitcoin mining data center in Missoula County, called “Project Spokane.” Also read: Bitcoin: Hardware or Software? That is the Question Officials in Montana and the state’s Governor, Steve Bullock, plan to bolster local businesses with job stimulus funding. According to the governor $1.1 million will be distributed to innovative companies that reside in particular counties across the state. One of them is Project Spokane LLC, a company that says it provides blockchain security validation services for the Bitcoin network; otherwise known as mining. Project Spokane applied for a $600,000 grant but will receive $416,000 from the Big Sky Economic Development Trust Fund (BSTF).   “Project Spokane, LLC is a data center that provides blockchain security services for the bitcoin network,” explains Montana’s government website announcement. According to commentary from James Grunke, the president and CEO of the Missoula Economic Partnership, in an interview with the local publication the Missoulian it is great news for the county.      “They are on their way to becoming North America’s largest data center,” Grunke tells the Missoulian about Project Spokane last March.  Project Spokane also says that it will create 65 new jobs for residents and the data center will be located at the old Bonner mill site. Funds will be used to purchase more equipment, and software for the company’s Bitcoin network services. Project Spokane has a few job listings posted on sites like Linkedin and Community Spiceworks, looking for service providers. The Montana data center will join the steadily growing bitcoin mining operations taking place in the U.S. The well-known U.S. bitcoin miner Dave Carlson is in the process of building up his latest mining operation Giga Watt in the states. Meanwhile, the anti-virus tycoon John McAfee has also created a bitcoin mining facility in the U.S. and has partnered with Bitmain. Moreover, the bitcoin infrastructure firm Bitfury also has an operation in the state of Georgia which also aims to bolster the state’s economy and jobs.     The job stimulus funding provided to Montana businesses is also one of the first grants given to a bitcoin mining operation based in the U.S. Governor Bullock believes the companies chosen for funding will help build a stronger economy in Montana.

Also Read: Bitcoin Startups Believe Africa Is Fertile Ground for Crypto-Solutions The recent increase in South African Localbitcoins trading volume can be interpreted as an indication of a real increase in bitcoin adoption, as supported by trading volume on the nation’s major exchange, Luno, also seeing a steady rise.  In 2017 many developed nations have begun to move towards introducing permissive regulation designed to encourage growth within Bitcoin’s associated industries. In recent months Japan has eliminated taxation on Bitcoin trading, declared Bitcoin to be exempt from consumption tax, and eliminated the possibility of double taxation on trading. Australia has moved towards ending its long-standing double taxation on bitcoin by proposing that transactions involving digital currencies no longer be subject to Goods and Services Taxation, and South Korea has also introduced permissive regulations regarding Bitcoin and other digital currencies. Despite progressive moves on the part of South Africa’s developed counterparts, the South African Reserve Bank has not released a Position Paper on Virtual Currencies since 2014 when Bitcoin’s market capitalization was less than a quarter of its current $46bn USD total, which many citizens feel emphasizes the need for regulators to catch up with the industry.  South Africa recognizes the basic rights of citizens to own, purchase, mine, and conduct private transactions with bitcoin, yet no tax regime currently exists for bitcoin mining or trading. Bitcoin is not currently classified under any asset or currency status, leaving businesses operating with virtual currencies unsure as to whether or not they are likely to incur retroactive capital gains taxation in the future. Despite the ambiguity surrounding taxation, some have argued that South African regulators are highly permissive toward blockchain technology – arguing that the absence of a ratified legal framework does not hinder bitcoin-related enterprises from conducting their business. Although the South African Revenue Service have stated that both speculation or transactions conducted in Bitcoin are subject to general South African tax law, the absence of clear legal scheduling pertaining to digital currencies likely has a stifling effect on investment and innovation within the South African bitcoin economy.

2017-06-07T11:30:53-04:00,Prepare For SB1241’s Pit Bull Assault on Bitcoin Freedom,Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/prepare-for-sb1241s-pit-bull-assault-on-bitcoin-freedom/,"Senate Bill 1241 defines digital currencies as “monetary instruments” and digital exchanges/tumblers as “financial institutions” for purposes of enforcing anti-money laundering laws. If successful, the “Combating Money Laundering, Terrorist Financing and Counterfeiting Act” would inflict unhappy consequences on bitcoin freedom. [Note: for a section-by-section analysis of the bill, please click here. Section 13 deals directly with cryptocurrencies. The other sections become relevant only because 13 makes bitcoin fall under their purview.] Also read: European Commission Launches Digital Currency and Dark Web Consortium SB1241 would have another impact that is less obvious but equally sweeping. Federal law is centralized law; that is, the same regulation is imposed equally on all states. Of course, the ideal is no regulation at all except for the community standards of businesses and users. But if bitcoin is to be regulated, then a patchwork of incompatible or differing laws is far more favorable to freedom than homogeneity. A network of decentralized authorities (states) may not constitute liberty but it does offer alternatives and escapes for those who seek greater freedom. Section 13 of SB1241 is entitled “Prepaid Access Devices, Stored Value Cards, Digital Currencies, and Other Similar Instruments.” This would amend Section 5316 of Title 31 in two significant ways. First, 5316 currently states: “(2) ‘financial institution’ means—…(B) a commercial bank or trust company.” This would be amended to insert “or any digital exchange or tumbler of digital currency.” The news site Coindesk observes, “the bill clarifies that any ‘issuer, redeemer or cashier’ of a ‘digital currency’ is also covered.” Second, a summary of the bill provided by co-sponsor Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) states, In other words, digital exchanges would become the equivalent of banks. Here, “institution” refers to a society or an organization. A “parallel institution” refers to a society or organization that acts as a counterbalance or competing authority to another organization, such as the federal government. Parallel institutions have always benefited freedom-seekers, especially religious and political refugees. In the Middle Ages, Protestant dissenters fled Anglican England to find refuge in the Netherlands. Puritans colonized the New World and served as a beacon to others who sought religious liberty. The power of parallel institutions is captured by the principle of “sanctuary” by which a Church exercises a higher authority than the State and can refuse to surrender ‘criminals’ who seek refuge within its walls. The political version of sanctuary plays out every day. People cross the border of one nation and escape into another. The second nation is not necessarily freer than the first but some aspect of it is freer to the refugee. Russia may not be freer than America, for example, but to Edward Snowden it is. The Ecuadorian embassy in London may be obscenely confining but it is more expansive than a prison cell to Julian Assange. Parallel institutions also play an important practical role in the bitcoin community which is highly fluid and transplantable. In June 2015, a harsh licensing requirement for crypto businesses became law In New York with enforcement to begin in August. Many businesses chose to leave rather than abide by a license that required, among other things, the divulgence and sharing of customer data. Fortune magazine noted, “Last weekend the deadline to apply for a BitLicense came and went, and a slew of bitcoin startups went too—right out of New York State… This is not a comprehensive list, but here are some of the companies that packed up and left New York: Bitfinex, Bitquick, BTCGuild, Eobot, Genesis Mining, Gocoin, Kraken, Localbitcoins, Paxful, and Poloniex.”  Those who physically left did so by relocating to parallel institutions – that is, to other states with more palatable environments. The power of parallel institutions is also seen through what happens when the two merge their interests and become, in effect, one institution. Instead of offsetting each other’s power, they buttress and increase it at the expense of individual freedom. When church and state speak with one voice, both become more oppressive; it was precisely because the Anglican Church was the state church of England that religious dissenters felt impelled to flee. In extreme cases, the melding of church and government can lead to an Inquisition. When capitalism and government blend their interests, the results are no less devastating. Crony capitalism is established; government and favored businesses grant each other privileges by which both grow rich by picking the pockets of average people. This bastardization of the free market is an efficient engine of oppression. S1241 is the federal government’s attempt to merge its power with that of the states and to homogenize that power under laws it enforces. There would be “one law to rule them all, one law to find them, one law to bring them all and in the darkness bind them.” Moving from state to state to escape a specific regulation is a relatively trivial task. Under SB1241 and the follow-on legislation it would inspire, physical bitcoin businesses would need to move internationally or shut down. SB1241 was referred to the Senate Judiciary Committee on May 25. This is the preliminary step before a bill can be introduced into the House or Senate for debate and, perhaps, a vote. In short, S1241 is in the earliest stage of legislation, and many bills never make it out of committee. If it does move forward, then the bill’s sweeping scope may be a barrier to passage in either the House or the Senate. On the other hand, the draft bill may deliberately express overreach in order to provide room for negotiation and compromise. And another terrorist attack on U.S. soil could create a political hysteria that the bill could ride into becoming law. One thing is clear: S1241 is what some—and probably many—politicians want to impose on monetary instruments, including bitcoin, and financial institutions, including digital currency exchanges. A last point: S1241 mandates a report from Department of Homeland Security which is due 18 months after the bill’s passage. DHS is asked to detail “a strategy to detect prepaid access devices and digital currency at border crossings and ports of entry”. Travelling in and out of the U.S. with bitcoin could become a real problem. Currency control at the border is an indication of a government that is becoming or has become a totalitarian state. S1241 is a dot on the legal horizon. Whether or not it passes, this is the direction the state is pushing and will continue to push cyptocurrencies. Prepare now.

Last month, Bitcoin.com reported on Peach Aviation’s plan to accept bitcoin payments for tickets by the end of the year. This is made possible through a partnership with Tokyo-based bitcoin exchange and payments startup Bitpoint. The bitcoin payment system will be introduced on the airline’s website, the Asahi Shimbun reported on Tuesday, adding that: According to the partnership agreement between Bitpoint and Peach, the two companies expect Bitcoin usage to grow in Japan. They have agreed to work together to offer the following Bitcoin services: In addition to accepting bitcoin online and at ticket counters, Peach may offer the option to pay with the digital currency at its own duty-free shop. The store, called “Fuchsia by Peach,” opened in October 2012 at Kansai International Airport.  According to the Asahi Shimbun, Peach expects more tourists to switch to using bitcoin, “which allows them to travel light and saves them the trouble of carrying around cash or exchanging money for the local currency,” the publication wrote.

This investment is subject to shareholder approval and due diligence which would be done by June 30. If the shareholder approval is not obtained, Digitalx has agreed to pay BGL a break free penalty of AUD$100,000. BGL operates ACX.io which is Australia’s largest and most liquid bitcoin exchange by volume.

2017-06-07T02:00:59-04:00,Bitcoin Markets Increasingly Reflect Global Transition Towards âThe Asian Centuryâ,Samuel Haig,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-markets-increasingly-reflect-global-transition-towards-asian-century/,"A resurgence in Chinese Bitcoin trading volume following huge growth in the Japanese and South Korean markets is forecasting a future where the US markets follow Asian price moves. Also Read: Researcher from China’s Central Bank Discusses an ICO Regulatory Sandbox Chinese bitcoin exchange rates has taken a 3% price lead following announcements that two of the three âbig exchangesâ in China will again be accepting deposits and withdrawals in fiat currencies.  Chinaâs bitcoin markets had come to resemble a sleeping giant in recent weeks, following a crackdown on high leveraged margin trading by the PBOC earlier this year. The fall-out saw restriction being placed on the margin thresholds available to Chinese traders, and resulted in a 90% reduction in trading volume across the major Chinese exchanges. The announcement that two of the exchanges have returned to operations as usual regarding deposits and withdrawals has been the catalyst for Bitcoinâs sharp rise in price over recent days, culminating in the establishment of a new all-time high of over 20,000 CNY – evidencing that China may be able to again rival Japan in the near future for market dominance, despite trading volume having not recovered since the crackdown. The resurgence of Chinese bitcoin trading comes after a long period of dramatically rising growth of Bitcoin trading volume from major economic powers within the Asian region. Japan rapidly rose to a position of dominance within Bitcoin starting in 2016, which has been assisted by the introduction of an extremely Bitcoin-friendly regulatory framework across the entire nation. In South Korea bitcoin is currently trading at prices more than $1000 higher than current US prices, owing to the introduction of permissive regulations, significant increases in user adoption, and the inaccessibility for foreign citizens to access South Korean bank accounts. India also saw a dramatic surge in bitcoin usage towards the end of 2016, following an intensification of the war on cash in an attempt to centralize and restrict the financial freedoms of the nationâs most vulnerable citizens. This dramatic growth in bitcoin user adoption throughout the AsianÂ regions is forecasting an increasingly reduced influence and market share enjoyed by US markets, which briefly overtook Chinaâs trading volume following the fallout from the PBOC interventions for the first time since 2013.  Despite recent baby-steps toward more inclusive and fostering regulatory frameworks pertaining to Bitcoin on the part of Western governments, it appears that the Asian markets will increasingly dominate the cryptocurrency markets.

Lots of investors these days are shining a positive light on the decentralized cryptocurrency and some of them have changed their opinions held in the past. Also read: Bitcoin Experiences an Intense Flow of New Money and Mainstream Attention This week the billionaire tycoon Mark Cuban changed his tune towards bitcoin as the entrepreneur gave bitcoin a thumbs up to his 7.1 million Twitter followers. Cuban is a well-known U.S. businessman who owns the NBA team the Dallas Mavericks and is invested in many popular companies such as Magnolia Pictures, Dropbox, and AXS Television. Furthermore, the billionaire investor is also one of the hosts of the show “Shark Tank” featured on NBC. A few years ago back in 2014 Cuban told the publication Entrepreneur.com that he had not invested in bitcoin. “Nope, I haven’t invested in Bitcoin yet — I go up and down on it,” explained Cuban on the set of Shark Tank. Later on that year Cuban told the news outlet USA Today he did believe bitcoin was “great as an encryption technology,” but thought the future of bitcoin’s value was dismal. The investor explained that central banks will not allow the technology to grow as a currency.    “As a transport mechanism, an accounting digital transport mechanism, it’s unique and has a great opportunity in the future,” Cuban detailed to the publication at the 2014 SXSW conference. However Cuban told the press that he was still undecided about the technology and his stance against it wasn’t set in stone. When asked if he would ever consider adding bitcoin to his portfolio Cuban stated, “The jury’s still out — We’ll have to wait and see.” Now it seems times have changed and Cuban may have come to a conclusion concerning bitcoin. On June 6 as the price of BTC surpassed $2900 across global exchanges Cuban told his 7.1 million Twitter followers;  However, following his tweet Cuban does detail that he thinks bitcoin could be in a bubble.  “I think it’s in a bubble — I just don’t know when or how much it corrects,” details the investor. “I think blockchain is very valuable and will be at the core of most transactions in the future. Healthcare, finance, etc all will use it,” Cuban adds. As bitcoin continues to grow more valuable mainstream media and many well-known investors are bolstering bitcoin more often. Just recently John Bollinger, the inventor of the financial analysis indicator Bollinger Bands, mentioned bitcoin to his 11,000 Twitter followers. Alongside this, the professional poker player and socialite, Dan Bilzerian, explained to his 22 million Instagram followers that he just invested in a “sh*tload” of bitcoin last week. Moreover, Mark Cuban is not the only NBA team owner interested in bitcoin as the owner of the Golden State Warriors, Chamath Palihapitiya, told his 67,000 Twitter followers that the cryptocurrency was the “ultimate insurance policy against autocracy.” What do you think about Mark Cuban telling his Twitter fans to follow bitcoin news?

Small businesses listed on stock exchanges that offer bitcoin-related services are seeing their share prices rise as the price of bitcoin spikes. Also read: Japan’s Near-Zero Savings Rates and Pension Problems Drive Retail Investors to Bitcoin On April 1, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government legalized bitcoin as a form of payment. The law, which enforces strict rules on bitcoin exchanges, gives the digital currency more credibility. Many companies subsequently began integrating bitcoin into their business models, with some forming partnerships with small bitcoin startups. As bitcoin becomes more widely accepted in Japan, its price rises sharply. The cryptocurrency has risen approximately 180 percent at press time since the beginning of the year, according to data from Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bitflyer. Meanwhile, small exchange-listed companies that have started incorporating bitcoin into their businesses are seeing a similar pattern in their share prices. A well-known Japanese day trader, Naoki Murakami, said that “All of these gains coincide with bitcoin’s rally,” Bloomberg reported on Monday. He explained: “From about a month ago when all these virtual currencies started spiking like crazy, we began seeing the so-called ‘stocks of the virtual currency bubble,”’ he noted. In addition, he explained that Japanese stock markets have relatively loose listing requirements, therefore many small companies are able to go public with “no income and a market value of as little as $10 million.” That is why the Tokyo Stock Exchange is home to hundreds of small companies, he explained, adding that: Among companies that are seeing their stocks rally after they announced businesses relating to digital currencies are Remixpoint Inc, Infoteria Corporation, and Fisco Ltd, according to Bloomberg. Remixpoint Inc. is the largest of the three companies, having a market value of about 31.3 billion yen ($283 million). The company opened a bitcoin exchange, Bitpoint, at the end of May before announcing its plans to install over 100,000 ATMs nationwide. Its stock has more than doubled in value since the partnership with Peach Aviation to bring bitcoin payments to the airline, Bloomberg noted. “Remixpoint is trading at 514 times earnings, the highest among all Japanese technology companies worth more than 30 billion yen.” Infoteria Corporation partnered with bitcoin exchange platform developer Tech Bureau and is testing ways to use blockchain technology for proxy voting. The company saw its shares up more than 50 percent in the past month. Similarly, financial information services provider Fisco Ltd. began operating a bitcoin exchange last year and is up about 25 percent since early May, the news outlet detailed. When the price of bitcoin fell, these companies’ share prices also experienced a similar downturn. However, overall, their gains have significantly outweighed their losses.

Bitcoin hasn’t always had an easy time in Venezuela. The government has consistently arrested suspected bitcoin miners and the banking industry forced the country’s former leading exchange, SurBitcoin, to suspend fiat deposits or withdrawals. But in a country with rampant inflation, reaching a staggering 800% in 2016, surely bitcoin can provide some of the answers rather than be looked at as a problem to Venezuela’s ongoing crisis. As bitcoin doesn’t suffer from inflation in the same way that fiat currency’s do, it makes perfect sense to Venezuelans looking for a way to store their hard earned money without the risk of it just evaporating away. The government has finally come around to the same view and has given official permission for one bitcoin exchange to fully operate, under the watchful eye of Sudeban, the country’s highest banking regulator. Monkeycoin, as the exchange is known, is the first Venezuelan exchange to be working with the relevant regulatory bodies in order to bring the benefits of bitcoin where much needed. By maintaining regular dialogue and full cooperation with the authorities on issues like KYC (know-your-customer) and on potential suspicious activity – though not easy, bitcoin is still prone to money laundering – Monkeycoin is aiming to show that a regulated bitcoin exchange is the best way forward for bitcoin in Venezuela. Monkeycoin is run entirely on draglet’s Exchange Software. This white label solution covers all aspects of Monkeycoin’s software needs, from the trading algorithm to KYC management, from security to order book management. What is most interesting is how liquidity is generated, as any new exchange will have trouble filling its order book in its early days. draglet’s software uses what is known as a Distributed Shared Orderbook (DSO). In this format, Monkeycoin is connected to a network of global crypto-exchanges and shares their order books. This ensures that right from the very start Monkeycoin will have a full and healthy order book, allowing users to buy and sell against all other users on the DSO network. Other than liquidity, the key requirement for an exchange is security. As you would expect from such an exchange, Monkeycoin offers a maximum-security service using the latest in encryption technology and cold multi-signature storage for customer funds – all based on draglet’s Exchange Software. With recent events in the world of bitcoin exchanges, security and trust are of utmost importance for customers and regulators alike. With draglet’s comprehensive software, Monkeycoin also has access to integrated wallets with the ability to manage any currency; support software that covers all languages; a platform that guarantees 99.9% uptime; and a range of user defined micro-services that enhance functionality at the press of a button. All in all, Monkeycoin sets out to bring the global bitcoin market to troubled Venezuela. With rising demand for bitcoin and the advantages it has in periods of inflation, an openly approved exchange is just what the nation needs. In a distressed economy, Monkeycoin provides the access to stable finance that seems to be so precious in times like this. Press Contact Email Address

The decentralized currencyâs price has jumped leaps and bounds since last week’s downturn. Also read:Â Osforensics Founder Explains His Bitcoin Transaction Monitoring Tools A lot has changed since the last time bitcoinâs price hit a high of $2760 on May 25 and subsequently dropped over 30 percent the next day. For a few days, the price hovered between the $2250-2350 range then made its first jump above $2400, shocking those who predicted a bearish downtrend. Many traders and even the analystÂ Nicola Duke,Â featured on CNBC, thought the forecast was for the worst. The price âcould even fall as far as $1,470,â explained Dukeâs prediction. Things have changed since then as bitcoinâs price has rallied consistently over the course of the week. After breaking the $2400 threshold, bitcoinâs value quickly escalated past $2500 into the $2600 territory for a short period. The price range of $2700 and above lasted for about an hour and a half until $2800 was breached. Bitcoin now commands a $46 billion dollar market capitalization and $1.6 billion worth of bitcoins has been traded over the past 24 hours.  Technical indicators show the 100 Simple Moving Average is once again above the 200 SMA showing bulls are charging. Last weekâs gap to the downside had seen buyers take a rest, but the action is now hotter than ever. Furthermore, Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) are also signaling very bullish patterns. Breaking higher targets in the next 24-48 hours is definitely a possibility but a trend backward beneath the sub-$2800 range could also happen. Order books are moving at light speed on the top exchanges and price in countries like Japan and Korea are once again showing higher price points.  Overall positivity is high as far as the price is concerned, and this is leading to more mainstream attention focused on bitcoin. Online interest in bitcoin is also at an all-time high as Google Trends shows searches for bitcoin has surpassed 2013 records. Bear Scenario: Bitcoinâs price is swinging, and there could be a few bear traps along the way. When bitcoinâs fiat value touched $2840, the price quickly dropped to $2795 ten minutes later but has since rebounded to newer highs. At the moment there is a significant floor between the $2500-2600 range, for the time being, if a deep correction takes place. Bull Scenario: At the moment bulls are charging at full velocity with all of their force pushing the price higher. Reaching $3000 per bitcoin is not out of the question, and it could happen within the next 24-48 hours. At press time the buyers market is trying to escalate past the $2800 range into the $2900 territory. Â Â  What do you think about the price of bitcoin breaking $2800?

This sudden interest in trading and speculation in India has been exacerbated by a flood of positive news in the bitcoin ecosystem, including Japan’s acceptance of the currency and its ever-climbing, covetous price point. Also read: Russian President Vladimir Putin Discusses Using Ethereum with Vitalik Buterin In India, young adults age 18-35 have jumped on the bitcoin bandwagon with a hope of gaining lucrative returns from the ensuing bitcoin gold rush. A June 5 India Economic Times article read, “The once non-descript bitcoin, a cryptocurrency, has returned more than 10 times since 2015, with the price of the digital instrument hitting a record Rs 225,000 a unit in the domestic spot market last week. Trading in bitcoins is gaining traction, especially among those aged 18-35 years and seeking to harness volatility for extra-ordinary returns.” The article mentioned bitcoin trading price and volume has increased alongside bitcoin adoption and interest. In June 2015, the price of 1 bitcoin in India was 20,000 rupees, worth approximately $310. It has recently surged to approximately $3494 on Indian marketplaces. This sudden interest in bitcoin in India also comes at a time when the currency remains under scrutiny from the Indian government. On Mar 28, the India Economic Times released an article regarding how the Indian parliament was considering regulating bitcoin. Apparently, a slew of people getting involved in money laundering schemes have caused Reserve Bank of India to caution people holding bitcoin. They want to deter people from using it, especially if they might be deliberately or accidentally breaking the law. Bitcoin.com also covered the article and quoted the Minister of State Finance on the subject: No one can be sure how the recent confluence of events, including surging speculative interest by the youth alongside regulatory consideration by government, will finally impact the digital currency in India. Regardless of what happens, it appears that many different parties and individuals are taking a keen interest in bitcoin and its impact on personal finance and the Indian economy at large.

2017-06-04T19:00:45-04:00,Osforensics Founder Explains His Bitcoin Transaction Monitoring Tools,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/osforensics-founder-explains-his-bitcoin-transaction-monitoring-tool/,"Blockchain surveillance is slowly becoming the norm as cryptocurrencies become a more popularized technology. These days there are many startups and private investigators dedicated to helping global law enforcement and private businesses track bitcoin transactions. Also read: Blockchain Collectibles: A Discussion With the Creator of Curio Cards Bitcoin.com recently chatted with Richard Amores, a blockchain surveillance expert and the founder and CTO of Osforensics.us. Amores has designed tools that help him track bitcoin transactions to physical locations where he can visualize an IP address, GEO-location coordinates, the ISP and the host name of the full node. The blockchain forensics investigator claims the tools can analyze wallets with thousands of transactions in minutes in contrast to the weeks and months it would take law enforcement. Amores gives our readers an inside look at how he started and how his tools help him track cryptocurrency transactions.  Bitcoin.com (BC): When did you first get introduced to bitcoin? Richard Amores (RA): November 2013 was when I first got my first blockchain.info wallet. That means about 2012 is when I started playing with bitcoin and tried mining. I still have some hardware mining rigs in the basement. My first book was on Tor the dark web; I wrote my second book about Bitcoin because it was about the Tor-Dark Web financial system. Bitcoin was all the rage in the dark web and still is, but it was never anonymous. Freedomnet, I2p, and Tor — The intelligence and encryption of the peer-to-peer network was the fascinating thing for me, I’m more a network guy. Then you get the Genesis coin within the public ledger, and everything flows forward in time and transactions.  BC: When did you decide to create the bitcoin tracking forensics tool? RA: About a year ago a customer asked me if finding the physical location of a wallet was possible. As I explored the edge-routers of the peer-to-peer networks that Tor and Bitcoin and many other networks use, the answer became obvious. Investigators sometimes see a bitcoin wallet as a physical dead end. Many tools focus on tracking the wallet and the ping-pong game that people do to hide their wallets address. We focus on the transactions, this is when the network and the public ledger meet. I wish I could say that we can identify all wallets’ physical locations, but we cannot at this time. The older and the more transactions, the better to track down physical wallets. Our Tool tracks forward in time and backward in transactions as I mentioned before. So if you messed up in the past or future, we got you. BC: Have you helped any law enforcement (LE) agencies track Bitcoin transactions? RA: Yes, on many occasions I have worked with LE and others all over the world. I have a Tor crawler and search engine that helps us find wallets and other ID’s on the dark web. As with many investigators, I use Blockseer and blockchain.info and my own blockchain to track wallets. The truth of the matter is LE doesn’t pay if they can get away with it. One time I got paid in Kroger’s money orders, guess out of petty cash. This one was not your usual LE type but the real money guys are the IRS. BC: If a bitcoin user hops between multiple public blockchains, does it affect your analysis? RA: It doesn’t matter, our tool can help to identify wallets from the same owner, but its not designed for tracking and following wallets which are two different things. Our tool is for analyzing transactions and looking at the network and see what data we can get. If you look at the (two images below), Node Types identify the Bitcoin protocol on the four different things it does, Wallet — Miner — Full — Blockchain — Network. Now the Bitcoin Network Image is the one where we can see that the main part of the Full-blockchain — The Network is on the edge routers. This where the transactions (TX) happen and for a network geek it’s the most fun to analyze. So multiple blockchains that operate on a similar network to execute a TX makes no difference, without the network and how it works, you can’t transmit a TX without it and the protocol that it works on peer-to-peer on top of TCP/IP.  BC: How useful is your tool or Blockchain surveillance if a bitcoin user utilizes a tumbler or mixing platform? RA: We’ve seen all kinds of tricks to displace wallets and transactions into ‘Neverland’, from different currencies to mixing services to hide wallets. We see wallets that offer a new wallet address for every transaction so they can keep the master wallet secret. At the end of the day, you are going to cash out or move your funds. The wallet software will now take all the coins you own and add them up to send out a TX, and those hidden wallets that you created will show up as INPUTS. Now we see your collection of wallets that you believed were secret. BC: What about other cryptocurrencies that claim to offer better anonymity like Monero for instance, are these digital assets harder to track? RA: We are looking at any coin that has a peer-to-peer network, and a blockchain and most do. Litecoin and others that have very similar codebase will be easier. Others will be a challenge but the protocol they use has to ride on the internet, and the network protocol rules apply. BC: Since the inception of the Silk Road, how big have Dark Net markets grown? RA: Since 2013-14 we saw about 400 odd hidden service websites, when I ran my last crawl in Jan-2017, I started with over 4,000, so it has grown leaps and bound. I would run a crawl in 3-6 hours, now it’s a day and a half and babysitting it all. Just look at the Grams site – the pharma market is the biggest selling with pills all over the place. We do have a pill epidemic not just in America but worldwide. Plastic credit cards is another big deal in the Tor landscape. Then you have people that believe that a Bitcoin transaction in the dark web is secret. Tor works on Port 9001 and Bitcoin works on port 8333 same wire different ports, the only thing you give out in a Bitcoin — Tor TX is the IP address of the hidden service website that they are trying to hide. Bittorrent in Tor exposes the true IP of the client and the server. FYI be careful not all things in the dark web are true.  BC: In your opinion what are the safest bitcoin wallet types? RA: I would go with a full-node CLI running bitcoinD. But what is safe if I am trying to hide my coins? I built a BIP-32 Deterministic wallet a few years back. One master wallet – and one back-up that can control millions of sub-wallets. So I would go with a BIP-32 Deterministic wallet with a CLI. BC: Do you believe bitcoin has a chance of gaining mass adoption in white markets? I mentioned the BIP-32 wallet I created, well, that was for Wall Street – not mentioning names but they stole my code. Think of the Bond market, yeah, I know boring, but there are about two Bond companies worldwide. When you cash out a bond, it’s a bunch of middle managers approving this and that verifying this and that. Well, the blockchain would be a good way to eliminate all these jobs worldwide and automate it pretty easy in the contract side of the blockchain. So yeah, even private blockchains that only the central banks could join and then control things more with smart contracts, that’s what Ethereum is all about that’s why the value went from 22 bucks a few months back to now over 150 or so. The white market is just as bad as the black market, and they will hide their wallets the same way that big shell companies hide things. So I can imagine my tool looking at all the White Market players wallets to find all their physical locations. Now add up the amounts, and you can tell who is investing in what for any corporate espionage it would be a cool tool. Time and space, since we can track bitcoins forwards and backwards in time, the physical locations are already written all we need is my tool to read them, and yes that would be fun but time-consuming.

At the same time, they are worried about a serious shortfall in the national pension program. These problems have pushed retail investors to consider investing in bitcoin. Also read:Â Japanâs Bitpoint to Add Bitcoin Payments to 100,000+ Stores Bitcoin is attracting “Mrs Watanabe“, or retail investors who were originally Japanese housewives. Retail interest has jumped, bitcoin exchanges toldÂ Reuters on Friday. Investors are âtrying to escape rock-bottom savings rates by investing in the cryptocurrency,â the publication wrote. The world’s third-largest economy has been “under a mounting debt burden that successive governments have failed to address,” the BBC describedÂ in May. Japan’s government debts have almost quintupled from 50% of the country’s GDP in 1980 to 239% of GDP today. Accompanying rising government debts is the falling of the Japanese household savings rate. From its peak of more than 23 percent, itÂ turned negative in 2013. Today, savings rates at Japanese banks are near zero. One of Japan’s largest banks, Mizuho Bank, offers aÂ 0.001% interest rate on savings accounts. Competing bank MUFG offers the same 0.001% rate whereas Nomura offers 0.02%. Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old social insurance and labor consultant,Â is among the Japanese retail investors drawn to bitcoin. She bought $1,800 worth of the digital currency to increase her retirement savings in March. “After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn’t sleep. It’s like buying a dream,” she told Reuters. About 26 percent of the population is over sixty-five years old in Japan, which is the age they can start receiving pensions. Last month, the World Health Organization (WHO) showed that country’s life expectancy at birth is 83.7 years of age. For more than 20 years, Japan has been ranked number one in this metric. Meanwhile, the Government Pension Investment Fund (GPIF), which is the world’s largest public pension fund, has been paying out to this growing retiree pool more than it takes in. The fund has also been suffering from poor performance. In 2015, its investment return was -3.81 percent, and in the first quarter of 2016, it suffered a loss ofÂ $51.8 billion. Higo’s personal response to the situation: According to Reuters, Japan’s moms and pops are drawn to bitcoin’s gains, now that the digital currency is regulatedÂ and readily available to the public. They have been investing in stocks and futures but the broader Asian stock market benchmark has only gained 17 percent year-to-date. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has seen a rise of almost 140 percent against the yen at press time, even with the recent correction. At its peak price, bitcoin gained over 180 percent, according to the country’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bitflyer.  Do you think more Japanese retail investors will turn to bitcoin because of low-interest rates and pension problems? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-06-02T09:00:23-04:00,Bitcoin Solves Runaway Inflation by Undermining Trusted Third Parties,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-solves-runaway-inflation-by-undermining-trusted-third-parties/,"Bankers, governments, and other trusted centralized organizations require society to be steeped in runaway inflation. These fiduciary cartels thrive when they manipulate the money supply and cause drastic shifts in prices within the market economy they lord over. They believe the money supply must be regulated and controlled for the economy to function optimally, lest society collapses as a result of too little currency injection.  Also read: Bitcoin Could Progress the Fourth Industrial Revolution Says Wealth Manager Luckily, bitcoin solves the dilemma of needing a trusted third party to control the money supply. Before delving further into why this is the case, everyone must possess a proper and clear grasp of inflation and deflation as economic concepts. Inflation refers to the rise of the cost of goods and services in a market environment and the decrease of the purchasing power of the prescribed currency. Investopedia defined inflation, Conversely, deflation is the decline in the cost of goods and service resulting from contraction of a money supply within an economic environment. Deflation generally causes an increase of the purchasing power of a currency within circulation. According to some economists, excess deflation can cause market actors to horde money. However, inflation tends to be the more troubling and nefarious problem. For example, if a currency is heavily inflated, and you travel to the local supermarket to buy groceries, you may notice an upswing in the price of bread. This price “inflation” could be the result of the grocer arbitrarily altering the price, but more likely it occurred as a result of an inflated currency. In other words, too much printing and distribution of the currency would have devalued its purchasing power and caused bread to appear more expensive. In reality, the bread likely has had the same value as always, but the decreased value of the circulated currency provided the illusion that the bread was more expensive. With a basic understanding of deflation and inflation clearly in mind, it would seem obvious that central money manipulators are needed to keep the economy grounded in a state of equilibrium, where money is created with integrity and circulated for the betterment of society. However, there are several reasons why having a small trusted group of elites control society’s wealth is impractical, unneeded, and dangerous…and has only instigated economic woes. In some places, governments and central authorities have caused such extreme runaway inflation that a currency has lost all of its value and become worthless. Recent examples include Venezuela and Greece. Mass currency devaluation through inflation likely also occurred in the United States, which led to the Great Depression. The Austrian economists suggested that creation of the Federal Reserve bank and its manipulation of the currency supply directly caused the depression, among other, more recent economic catastrophes. A Mises article on Greece captured the effects of credit expansion and money manipulation, then the subsequent runaway inflation: Another reason to avoid allowing a handful people control currency in a centralized manner is because it provides a subtle way for those individuals to “steal” value from everyone. Whenever central authorities inflate the currency supply, as mentioned, it causes the value or purchasing power of the currency to decline. This value is basically lost or “stolen” from the people. In other words, one group caused another group to lose their property’s value. In most places, this activity by another name is called “destruction of property” or “theft.” However, currency devaluation is such an esoteric and ingenious form of theft or destruction that it goes unnoticed and unexamined by the majority of the population. A last major reason to reject central suppliers of money is more obvious and terrifying. When a small group of people have direct access to the wealth supply of whole economies, what prevents them from electronically keying that wealth into their own personal accounts? What stops them from making themselves richer and the rest of the world poorer? What stops them from taking that wealth and using it to start wars or harm people in the name of national defense or protection? The short answer to these questions is nothing. Nothing stops them. These individuals can fill their coffers at a whim, and control the rise and fall of whole country’s by arbitrarily inflating and deflating a currency as they see fit…and the result of allowing this kind of trust to be placed in the hands of these elite few have been absolutely devastating. It has led to mass warfare, mass exploitation of the population, and in some cases to runaway inflation, mass starvation and death. Thank goodness the solution to these problems is here. It is called bitcoin. Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency that is automated by a consensus network algorithm. This algorithm, which was predetermined by creator Satoshi Nakamoto, has a set supply of bitcoins that will be distributed over the long term. This number is currently set to 21 million units of bitcoin. This mathematically encoded number of bitcoin means that no central group or fiduciary cartel can control the currency. In other words, they cannot inflate or deflate a currency to the detriment of the population. In this sense, bitcoin is naturally deflationary or disinflationary. This denotes Bitcoin has utility in the sense that it neither inflates or deflates on a whim or caprice. No human actor can make changes to the protocol without achieving consensus. In this regard, users of bitcoin have hedged themselves against control, against the small groups of trusted elites who can manage the flow or circulation of money across a population. When a currency like bitcoin is protected from artificial manipulation, it prevents people from using the creation and control of money to exploit and defraud others. It is the solution to the problem of runaway inflation and all forms of monetary control. Some people think that bitcoin is naturally inflationary as a result of its algorithm. It is true the protocol specifies the minting of new coins via mining, but this is not the same as arbitrary inflation that causes ungodly increases in price of goods and services. The protocol was built to create coins in such a way that both heightens the value of bitcoin and does not allow for the market to be flooded. It is enough to keep the market humming, yet not overburdened. Bitcoin, then, is the most obvious solution to stopping the fiduciary cartels and other central entities from lording over everyone and causing massive undue harm to millions. It prevents runaway inflation. It stops theft through that inflation. It thwarts loss of monetary value caused by unscrupulous actors. It kills the evil of greed. It is the economic panacea par excellence. Time to open a bitcoin wallet and take the power back.

These investments are available for regular brokerage accounts as well as self-invested personal pension accounts. Also read: Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Resume Withdrawals Hargreaves Lansdown plc is a financial service company based in Bristol, a city in South West England. The company “is the UK’s number 1 ‘investment supermarket’ for private investors,” according to its website. With 876,000 clients and more than £70 billion traded, the company currently offers “more than 2,500 funds, UK, US, Canadian and European shares, ETFs, investment trusts, bonds and gilts.” Different types of accounts are available through its investment platform, also known as the Vantage Service. They include regular brokerage accounts, tax-efficient Individual Savings Accounts (ISA) and Self-Invested Personal Pension (SIPP) accounts. On Thursday, June 1, two bitcoin investments were added to Hargreaves Lansdown’s platform; Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Tracker Eur. Listed on Nasdaq Nordic in Stockholm, the former is denominated in Swedish krona (SEK) and the latter in the euro (EUR). Both are issued and managed by Stockholm-based XBT Provider AB, with Global Advisors (Jersey) Limited as the guarantor. Both instruments are bitcoin Exchange-Traded Notes (ETNs) which are debt securities backed by the credit of the issuer. They track the price performance of bitcoin, giving investors exposure to the digital currency. However, investors do not own the bitcoin itself. Danny Cox, Head of Communications at Hargreaves Lansdown, told the Telegraph that “We have seen a handful of clients asking for the ETN.” XBT Provider describes its products: The primary marketplaces listed in the ETNs’ prospectus are Okcoin, Kraken, Bitstamp, Bitfinex, Itbit, Gemini, Gdax, and Gatecoin. The foreign exchange rate risk for Bitcoin Tracker One is USD/SEK whereas it is USD/EUR for Bitcoin Tracker Eur. While the certificates are denominated in SEK and EUR, they track the price of bitcoin in USD. “As the BTC/USD market is the most liquid bitcoin market widely available for trading, we regard it as the most suitable underlying asset in a bitcoin product,” the company explained. Both ETNs are currently available for Hargreaves Lansdown investors with regular brokerage accounts or SIPP accounts, but not tax-advantaged ISA accounts. The brokerage firm charges £11.95 per trade to start investing in these instruments but the cost decreases with the number of trades. Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) also used to be available for online trading on the Hargreaves Lansdown platform for regular brokerage accounts, but not SIPP or ISA accounts. However, the brokerage firm has posted a notice on its website which reads: “Bitcoin Investment Trust NPV cannot currently be traded online. For further information about trading this security, or to obtain a current price, please telephone our dealers.” This restriction is likely due to the trust having applied to list and trade on the NYSE Arca exchange. Its application is now pending approval by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a bitcoin Exchange-Traded Fund (ETF).

The 3.65 TH/s mining servers can be tethered together in managed clusters utilizing the Avalon 6s USB hub connectors. The Canaan miners are controlled by a standard Raspberry Pi, and they are powered via 4 PCI-E 6 Pin adapters. Canaan’s Avalon 6 has received great reviews since it was released and is said to be a “tough contender” among miners with roughly the same amount of TH/s. The miner’s reviews also say the versatile machine has many customization options that will bolster all types of mining set-ups and facilities.       Bitmain’s Antminer S7 Series The Antminer series is well known among mining enthusiasts, and the S7 series is no different. The Antminer stock S7 utilizes 162 of the company’s BM1385 16nm ASIC chips at a hashrate of 4.86 TH/s. The miner is ideal for those who have access to low-cost electricity with the miner’s excellent power consumption using only 1210 Watts. The BM1385 ASIC chipsets typically produce 32.5 GHS per chip at optimal settings. Bitmain’s S7 also has solid reviews detailing the Antminer S7s performance. The S7 is known for being a “solid performing Bitcoin ASIC miner” that also allows for tweaks and modifications. Furthermore many have said the Antminer S7 is a reliable machine with controller options that are vigorous and has been considered one of the “best bitcoin mining servers available to end users” when it was released.           For operators with lower energy costs, the merits with purchasing older generation miners are significant. This is because they can offer a more profitable return on investment (ROI) due to the hardware’s substantially lower cost per terrahash, relative to new servers.

2017-06-01T06:01:53-04:00,Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Resume Withdrawals,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-bitcoin-exchanges-resume-withdrawals/,"Chinese bitcoin exchanges have reportedly resumed bitcoin withdrawals. Customers of BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin can now withdraw their coins up to certain daily limits. Also read: India’s Government Divided Over Bitcoin Legalization Following the inspections by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), BTCC, Huobi, and Okcoin halted coin withdrawals in February. Almost four months later, on Wednesday May 31, at least two of them reportedly lifted their cryptocurrency withdrawal suspensions. According to Twitter user Cnledger, BTCC’s customer service confirmed that they have resumed coin withdrawals on Wednesday. A Reddit user who claimed to have initiated a withdrawal request at the exchange said that the daily limit was 20 BTC for his account type and that his request was approved within 20 minutes. Okcoin has also lifted its withdrawal suspension subject to certain limits, 8btc reported on Thursday. “The 24-hour withdrawal limit of the International site and OKEX is: 200 BTC, 500 LTC and 1,000 ETH,” the publication quoted the exchange’s website. “As for the Chinese site, the limit is 20 BTC (10 of which could be withdrawn to external addresses), 400 LTC (200 of which could be withdrawn to external addresses) and 1,000 ETH.” However, the exchange’s customer service told the publication: The last of the “Big Three” Chinese bitcoin exchanges to resume withdrawals is Huobi. According to Cnledger on Thursday morning, Huobi has also resumed withdrawals and “users can withdraw up to 50 BTC per day.” The results of the withdrawals resuming were quickly realized at global exchanges on Wednesday. While the price of a bitcoin rose sharply worldwide, they were more bullish on BTCC and Okcoin, typically trading 10 percent higher than other exchanges. For instance, while Bitflyer, Bitstamp, and Bitfinex had 5%, 7%, and 9% positive gains respectively on Wednesday evening, Okcoin and BTCC had a 19% and a 15% 24-hour growth. The price of litecoin on Chinese exchanges also experienced the same effect. Global trading volumes also picked up substantially after the news spread, with BTCC and Okcoin showing higher volumes than elsewhere for the rest of the day.  News of the withdrawals resuming came shortly after the three exchanges announced that they were adding either ETH or ETC trading to their platforms. Huobi began ETH trading on May 30 while Okcoin is starting on June 1. BTCC CEO Bobby Lee also announced a couple of days prior that his exchange will list ETC after conducting a series of Twitter polls. The PBOC’s inspections of Chinese bitcoin exchanges started in January. Then in February, all three major exchanges announced that they were halting bitcoin and litecoin withdrawals, but CNY withdrawals were not affected. A post on Huobi’s blog cites the need for a system upgrade to comply with new anti-money laundering requirements as well as foreign exchange and other financial regulations. Although the exchanges never stated whether they were ordered by the authorities to suspend withdrawals, a leaked document reported by 8btc in April suggests that the suspension was a direct order from one of the authorities. However, 8btc reported new findings last week that “the suspension of BTC withdrawal was not a direct order from the authority,” according to a recent letter from the PBOC. This letter was supposedly in reply to an inquiry about whether the central bank was responsible for bitcoin exchanges halting withdrawals. Cnledger also tweeted about this letter last week: Earlier this month, Bitcoin.com reported on the Chinese regulators preparing to issue regulatory guidelines for bitcoin trading platforms in China. The document is expected to be released sometime in June. Do you think Chinese bitcoin exchanges can return to their former popularity once the withdrawal limitations have all been removed?

2017-05-31T12:00:34-04:00,A ‘Segwit2x Working Group’ Has Submitted a Bitcoin Scaling Plan,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/segwit2x-group-bitcoin-scaling-plan/,"Just recently Bitcoin.com reported on a Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) written by Calvin Rechner that was recently submitted to the developer’s mailing list. There is another plan in the works initiated by Bitcoin developer and Bloq CEO, Jeff Garzik, that aims to combine Segwit and a 2MB block size increase. On May 30 Garzik addressed the community detailing his thoughts on bitcoin’s current throughput issues and the proposed scaling solutions’ intentions. Also read: Bitcoin Could Progress the Fourth Industrial Revolution Says Wealth Manager The bitcoin scaling discussion has been an ongoing ferocious debate that has lasted for years. Now there are multiple conversations taking place discussing different ways to scale like using alternative implementations of bitcoin’s code, a user-activated soft fork, extension blocks, emergent consensus, and just recently Barry Silbert’s idea. The suggestion announced by Silbert’s company the Digital Currency Group (DCG) is an agreement based off of RSK’s chief scientist, Sergio Demian Lerner’s Segwit-2MB proposal. Furthermore, Silbert claims to have backing from 56 companies and over 84 percent of hashrate support. Garzik has been working on a solution called “Consensus SegWit2x signaling on bit 4” which is available for viewing on Github. At the moment the pull request has quite a few developers discussing the idea and reviewing the code. There are also quite a few programmers that disagree with the concept in its entirety, or parts of the proposal, while there are others who are supportive of the compromise idea. On May 30 Garzik addressed the bitcoin ‘community’ in a personal blog post called “A personal note to the Bitcoin community.” “An entirely predictable and avoidable outcome — skyrocketing fees and network at max capacity — has come to pass, with the predicted results,” explains Garzik. The developer also says it doesn’t matter who played a particular role but “upgrading base block size did not occur.” Moreover, Garzik details that measurable data has, and always will cut through “silly conspiracy theories.” According to his post, the community should rely more heavily on the outcome of efforts rather than these theories. Garzik concludes by saying he hopes the community can judge by viewing “those who act, and produce measurable outcomes.” He believes doing so is far superior to resorting to personal attacks and spreading conspiracies. “I ask everyone who wants a better, brighter, more positive Bitcoin community to start here: Be Good To Each Other and let’s build good code,” Garzik adds. The blog post was submitted to multiple bitcoin forums and some of them submitted by Garzik himself. Of course, a few people disliked the idea, while others supported the concept of moving scaling along and bolstering a compromise. One bitcoin developer who has been a staunch supporter of the user activated solution, Eric Lombrozo, detailed his opinion on the proposal stating, “It’s beyond repair. I will continue to support BIP148 (UASF).” However, the DCG founder Barry Silbert immediately disagreed with Lombrozo’s statements. “Beyond repair?” Sibert says, responding to Lombrozo.  It’s still hard to tell what the “outcome” of the scaling debate will be and if the community will back the Segwit-2MB proposal idea. Nevertheless, it looks as though bitcoin proponents are trying to figure it out more so than ever before. What do you think about the Segwit2x Working Group proposal?

According to a well-known executive wealth advisor bitcoin is more than just an investment vehicle because it has the beneficial attributes that could give society an alternative financial system. Also read: Use of Bitcoin in Ecuador Continues to Grow Despite Government Ban Just recently the executive director of Taurus Wealth Advisors, Rainer Michael Preiss, told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” that bitcoin could aid the global economy that is seemingly getting worse every day with debt burden. According to Preiss, the financial system worldwide is based on debt which has led to quantitative easing and “too much debt and too little growth.” Preiss details that he believes bitcoin has significant potential that could progress the fourth industrial revolution. “Governments are potentially having long-term issues with debt repayment, and the world is suffering so much debt. Maybe the world needs an alternative — in the sense that bitcoin is an asset-backed currency with limited supply,” explains Preiss during the CNBC broadcast. When Preiss was asked about individuals and organizations using bitcoin for illegal activities like ransomware the wealth advisor said concerns are valid. However, the money manager said in comparison to illicit activity using the U.S. dollar the concerns about bitcoin is minuscule. Furthermore, Preiss details the USD is used for criminal transactions more than bitcoin, and it is rather hard to track, in contrast to bitcoin’s fully traceable public blockchain. “The question that always comes is: Is it a currency?” Preiss tells the news outlet. Preiss also explains that trust is becoming less common and the social contract is starting to crumble. The wealth advisor details that a decentralized financial infrastructure is very probable in the future. In fact, Preiss says that bitcoin has already claimed its stake within traditional monetary systems. “Bitcoin’s market capitalization overtook Deutsche Bank just as of last week, so that shows you how to some extent the world and things are changing,” Preiss adds.

Meanwhile, bitcoin trading volumes remain strong in the country. Also read: India’s Government Seeks Public Comments on How Bitcoin Should Be Regulated At a Parliamentary Standing Committee of Finance meeting last week, a heated discussion erupted among members of the Indian Parliament about bitcoin. A number of Parliament members, including BJP member Kirit Somaiya, “cautioned the finance ministry officials present at the meeting against any move to legalise bitcoin,” according to The Economics Times, India’s leading business newspaper. A source told the publication: They wanted the government to look into the vulnerability of bitcoin. Somaiya who has repeatedly spoken against the digital currency, calling it “illegal” on numerous occasions, raised a series of questions. He asked the officials why the government was being ambivalent about this instrument, citing that they have not clarified whether it was a legally permissible instrument or not. He also demanded to know whether officials are properly briefing the prime minister about the risks of bitcoin. Currently, the same government has been considering legalizing the digital currency. Last week, the Finance Ministry started soliciting comments from the public on how to best regulate bitcoin. The deadline for submissions is May 31, and 3,357 comments have been submitted at press time. The majority of them are in support of regulating bitcoin. “Regulating bitcoins will address many such concerns and queries, including market acceptance, customer trust, investment security, money laundering, hawala, etc,” Hesham Rehman, co-founder and CEO of Bitxoxo Bitcoins Online, was quoted by The Times Group as saying. “For instance, regulations like strong eKYC and penalizing bitcoin trading in cash will help proper transaction records which will negate all the chances of any sort of illegal activity.” Karthik Iyer, India’s Ambassador of the blockchain think tank P2P Foundations, also offered his viewpoint on the situation: Meanwhile, bitcoin trading volumes in India have exploded. Last week, the price of a bitcoin skyrocketed globally. During that spike, it traded at nearly a $1,000 premium in India as supplies to the country have been limited. This month, leading Indian bitcoin broker Zebpay announced that it had reached a milestone of over 500,000 app downloads and is adding more than 2,500 users daily. Struggling to keep up with the surge in new users and volume, Zebpay announced, “we have put a temporary buy limit of Rs 50,000 per day due to the shortage of bitcoin stock.” New user growth was also the cause of the downtime experienced at leading Indian bitcoin exchange by volume, Coinsecure. “We have been experiencing exponential growth of users on our website, causing slowness and stress on our systems,” according to a statement from CEO Mohit Kalra to Coinsecure’s customers. Meanwhile, on the peer to peer Localbitcoins exchange, trading volumes in Indian rupee hit record highs as well, with nearly double the previous week’s volume of rupees traded for bitcoin.

2017-05-30T12:00:28-04:00,Boliviaâs Government Arrests 60 People Over a Pyramid Scheme – Not Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bolivia-government-arrests-pyramid-scheme-not-bitcoin/,"The Bolivian government recently arrested 60 people over a pyramid scheme that claims to invest in bitcoin. However, the focus was on the scheme and not on bitcoin itself, even though the government banned the digital currency back in 2014. Also read:Â Use of Bitcoin in Ecuador Continues to Grow Despite Government Ban Bolivia’s Autoridad de SupervisiÃ³n del Sistema Financiero (ASFI)Â on May 19 announced that 60 people had been arrested for promoting âvirtual currency investmentsâ. The country’s federal banking, finance, and securities regulator states (loosely translated): The government’s announcement did not specify whether these activities were related to bitcoin. However, El Deber reported that they were related to a known pyramid scheme called âPay Diamond-Bitcoin,â which the authorities have kept an eye on for some time. Pay Diamond-Bitcoin is similar to aÂ larger scheme calledÂ Pay DiamondÂ which is also being investigated by the Bolivian government. Pay Diamond, believed to have swindled some 200,000 people, claims to buy, process and sell diamonds to the gemstone industry. The arrests were made by Boliviaâs Crime Fighting Special Forces (FELCC), and pamphlets used in the training were confiscated. According to ASFI Executive General Directorate, Lenny Valdivia Bautista, the meeting took place at the Cine Center of Santa Cruz de la Sierra. They were “carrying out training activities related to the investment of money with characteristics of multilevel activities,” she detailed. âThis type of activity is related to pyramid schemesâ with the sole purpose of appropriating money and the savings of the Bolivians, the announcement warns. Valdivia also urged Bolivians to protect their savings and their familiesâ well-being by reporting these âunlawful activitiesâ to ASFI or the FELCC. The announcement also reveals that: Another recent bust by the Bolivian government concerns a separate pyramid scheme and scam called âBitcoin Cash.â This scheme, surfaced in April, is similar to Pay Diamond-Bitcoin. The company promised to make investments in cryptocurrencies, mining abroad, and buying and selling bitcoins, La Razon Digital reported. However, once the schemeâs administrators got money from their victims, their website failed and the company no longer responds to queries, one victim told the publication. Last week, scam victims looking for refunds of their investments from Bitcoin Cash attacked the companyâs office in desperation, taking matters into their own hands. The angry mob reportedly burst into the office, took out their furniture, and set it on fire. In June 2014, Bolivia’s central bank officially banned the use of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in the country. The bank states at the time that “It is illegal to use any kind of currency that is not issued or controlled by a government or an authorized entity.” Public Resolution Number 044/2014, dated May 6, 2014, prohibits the use of any coins not issued or regulated in the country. Among them are “bitcoin, namecoin, tonal bitcoin, ixcoin, devcoin, freicoin, 10coin, liquidcoin, peercoin, quark, primecoin, feathercoin and others that do not belong to any country or economic zone,â the regulation states. Valdivia reiterated this status in the recent announcement, adding that âit is important to urge the population to denounce these cases in which people try to take advantage of people’s savings and saving families.â She indicated that ASFI, in coordination with “competent judicial authorities,” will enforce the law on any businesses nationwide that use virtual currencies or pyramid schemes. Bolivia was not the only country to ban bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2014. Nearby Ecuador made a similar move. Bitcoin.com recently reported on how the use of bitcoin continues to grow there despite the ban. What do you think about Boliviaâs enforcement of bitcoinâs legal status?

2017-05-29T12:00:38-04:00,A New Bitcoin Improvement Proposal Aims to Compromise,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-improvement-proposal-compromise/,"As the price of bitcoin settles down many bitcoiners are now concentrating on the scaling compromise proposed at the Consensus event held last week. Now a few bitcoin developers have decided to work on Segwit-2MB proposals that try to adhere to each side of the debate. Also read: Japan’s Bitpoint to Add Bitcoin Payments to 100,000+ Stores It is still hard to envision that everyone in the bitcoin community will be pleased with a compromise. There are still some bitcoin proponents who vehemently oppose Segwit, and then there are those who fully disagree with a 2MB hardfork. On May 29 a developer named Calvin Rechner submitted a new bitcoin improvement proposal (BIP) that aims to cohere to the recent Barry Silbert scaling concept. “This proposal is written under the assumption that the signatories to the Consensus 2017 Scaling Agreement are genuinely committed to the terms of the agreement, and intend to enact the updates described therein,” Rechner’s BIP details. Rechner explains that Shaolin Fry’s UASF is included so the existing Segwit deployment can be activated without creating a new release. Following the UASF implementation, the BIP explains that a 2MB hard fork deployment will occur six months after Segwit activation. “The intent of this proposal is to maintain full legacy consensus compatibility for users up until the hard fork block height, after which backwards compatibility is waived as enforcement of the hard fork consensus ruleset begins,” details Rechner. Following Rechner’s BIP submission, bitcoiners on social media and forums discussed the recent proposal. Throughout the conversations concerning the new BIP, a good portion of people seemed to like the idea. Some explained the reason they supported this proposal is because it includes UASF and the block size increase has safety nets in place to avoid divergent consensus. “The Spoonnet-based improvements need clarification IMO, but otherwise it looks like a possible win if the community will accept it,” explains bitcoin developer Luke Jr. “Provided there is reasonable consensus from the community, a soft-hardfork (aka MMHF aka Spoonnet) can be theoretically made pretty safe. But I’m not sure it can really be ready within six months.” Even though there still seems to be a lot of people hell bent towards not compromising at all, there are definitely signs of people looking to find the right compromise. It’s not certain this new BIP will be taken further, but it shows the growing trend to find consensus is important to most people from both sides of the debate.

Peach is Japan’s first Low-Cost Carrier (LCC) and is majority owned by the country’s largest airline, All Nippon Airways Co. Ltd (ANA). To accept bitcoin, the low-cost airline has partnered with Bitpoint Japan Co, a bitcoin exchange and payments startup founded on March 3, 2016. In addition to allowing Peach to accept bitcoin for flight tickets, the companies are working together to add bitcoin payment options to souvenir shops, restaurants, and hotels at travel destinations. Furthermore, “we will jointly install bitcoin ATMs where customers can withdraw cash from bitcoin,” their partnership agreement reveals. On Monday, Bloomberg reported that Bitpoint is “planning to give hundreds of thousands of Japanese retail outlets the ability to accept the digital currency.” The company’s president, Genki Oda, said, “We’re holding discussions with a retail-related company,” adding that: Bitpoint currently has ties with several retailers and plans to expand that number, Oda told the publication. The aim is to promote the use of bitcoin in retail stores instead of as a speculative investment, he detailed. Oda also runs Bitpoint’s parent company, Remixpoint Inc., a publicly-traded conglomerate with a market value of about 21 billion yen ($189 million). Since April 1, when the Japanese government started recognizing bitcoin as a legal method of payment, a slew of Japanese companies have started considering accepting bitcoin. The first major retailer to do so following the government’s move was Bic Camera, one of the country’s biggest electronics retailers. The company partnered with Japan’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bitflyer, to accept bitcoin. Also in April, another bitcoin exchange, Coincheck, announced that it had been working with Recruit Lifestyle to bring bitcoin payments to over 260,000 stores by this summer. Claiming to hold 99% of the bitcoin payment market share, Coincheck said that about 5,000 stores already accept the digital currency using its payments system. Then last week, Bitflyer CFO, Midori Kanemitsu, independently told Nikkei that the number of stores accepting bitcoin “is expected to rise to 300,000 or so in 2017.” If Kanemitsu’s estimation is added to Monday’s announcement by Bitpoint, then the total number of stores that could start accepting bitcoin soon could rise to 400,000+.

However, today bitcoin’s use continues to grow in the country. Also read: Bitcoin’s Price Correction Called in Advance by Analyst As part of a reform to the country’s monetary and financial laws, Ecuador banned bitcoin and other digital currencies in July 2014. The then-President Rafael Correa, who served from 2007 to 2017, introduced the bill that made bitcoin illegal and signed it into law. This law demands Bitcoin businesses “shut down their operations immediately.[…] Those who defy the ban will face prosecution, and all bitcoins circulated and assets in bitcoin trades face confiscation,” Panam Post reported at the time. Part of the aforementioned law calls for the creation of an Ecuadorian state-issued digital currency backed by the assets of the Ecuador’s Central Bank (BCE). Soon after banning bitcoin, the government rolled out its own digital currency, called Dinero Electrónico. It is pegged one-to-one to the US dollar, which is the country’s official currency. However, Ecuador’s private banks did not have confidence in the central bank’s electronic money system. Julio José Prado, President of the Association of Private Banks (ABPE) said at the time: Alexandra Veloz is an attorney based in Quito, the capital of Ecuador, and a member of the Ecuadorian Bar Association. She is currently the legal counsel for the Antigua Report. Referring to the state-run digital currency program, she said last week that “the new system has garnered plenty of criticism, and adoption from banks and customers has been limited at best.” Regarding the prohibition of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, Veloz explained that: She noted that the government’s move was “more precisely, a monopoly privilege: the Ecuadorian state has the exclusive power to put its own digital money into circulation via the central bank.” Despite the government making bitcoin illegal, its use has not halted in Ecuador, Veloz shared. There are buyers and sellers in the country who list themselves on Localbitcoins.com and bitcoin can also be purchased via Paypal like other online purchases, the attorney detailed. At press time, the cost of a bitcoin in Quito on the Localbitcoins market carries at least a $200 premium.

Three Unconventional Ways to Acquire Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/three-unconventional-acquire-bitcoin/,"Just recently we reported on four bitcoin exchanges that require very little identification. Alongside these peer-to-peer platforms, there are also other ways to purchase bitcoin without using a traditional exchange. There are other more unconventional methods, like purchasing bitcoin at a convenience shop or even with a store gift card.     Also Read: Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Considers Bitcoin   There are many trading platforms that people can use to purchase and sell bitcoin, but sometimes people don’t want to go through the hassle of registering with an exchange. On the other hand, some individuals also don’t want to use Localbitcoins as they may dislike the process of dealing with peer-to-peer traders. Many people don’t know that there are other types of methods individuals can use to purchase and sell bitcoin, and some of them may be at your local convenience store. Liberty X  The company Liberty X (formally Liberty Teller) was founded in 2014 by launching the first bitcoin ATMs in the U.S. Since then the startup has grown into a different kind of business by operating as a “virtual” bitcoin ATM provider. In order to purchase bitcoin with Liberty X you have to download the app for either Android or iOS and register with your phone number. Then you go onto the application’s map to find one of Liberty X’s local stores by typing in your zip code. Following this, a bunch of stores will pop up with red pendants, and you can choose the closest merchant near you. The highlighted store within the app will tell you the specific details on how much bitcoin you can buy and the fees associated with the purchase. After you choose a store, you simply travel to the location to purchase a bitcoin voucher. On arrival, you buy a voucher from the cashier that enables you to redeem bitcoin to any address. Using Liberty X to purchase bitcoin is a different kind of buying experience, and people may appreciate purchasing from a convenience store. Spare Now if you want to sell bitcoin there’s another way to obtain cash for your BTC that’s similar to the Liberty X transaction above. Using an iOS-only app called Spare users can sell bitcoins at local convenience stores located in Washington DC, Colorado, New York, Philadelphia, and New Jersey with more locations to follow. Users sell bitcoins to the service and receive a one-time generated PIN to give to the nearest shop on their GPS map. The clerk at the local convenience store will then verify the Spare application’s PIN and pay cash in exchange. Spare began offering bitcoin for cash services this year, and the company believes it takes the hassle out of searching for a two-way bitcoin ATM. “With Spare’s Bitcoin support, there will be no more wasting time searching for Bitcoin ATMs, as everything can be done directly from your iOS device. Alongside, inspired by a huge response in the domestic scene, we are now looking forward to pushing our game-changing service to international regions as well”, stated D’ontra Hughes, the founder of Spare. Paxful Another unconventional method to purchase and sell bitcoins is by using retail store gift cards. The peer-to-peer bitcoin exchange Paxful offers users the ability to trade gift cards for bitcoins from a wide variety of stores. Gift cards Paxful traders accept include cards for Amazon, Walmart, Vanilla Visa, Nintendo e-shop, Forever 21, Itunes, Footlocker, Fandango, and many more. To use Paxful’s gift card service just enter the type of card you have and the platform’s search engine will find traders that are willing to sell bitcoin for those cards. The founders of Paxful, Ray Youssef, and Artur Schaback say the platform services a lot of customers as the two told Bitcoin.com the company processes 8,000 bitcoin transactions per day. Paxful operates in a similar fashion to Localbitcoins, but the trading platform does not facilitate in-person local trades. Youssef says bitcoin has allowed the marketplace to provide different feature sets like gift card sales and other ways to trade.     “The advent of an instantly transferable digital currency like bitcoin has opened the door to an era of escrow services each catering to different niches and with different feature sets,” Youssef explained to Bitcoin.com. All of the services mentioned above have different benefits for those who would rather not trade on an online bitcoin exchange. But they also add other aspects to the equation like having to drive to physical locations to exchange. However, people may find themselves more comfortable purchasing and selling bitcoins with a store clerk in a public setting. Or maybe a person was given a few store gift cards for their birthday and would rather sell them for bitcoins. The fact is, as the ecosystem has shown immense growth over the years there are now many niche markets in 2017 that allow different ways to obtain bitcoin.

2017-05-27T19:00:29-04:00,Increased Bitcoin Demand Puts a Strain on Global Exchanges,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/increased-bitcoin-demand-strain-exchanges/,"Just recently we reported on the Poloniex exchange trying to handle a significant increase in cryptocurrency trading as well as a large influx of new customers. However, Poloniex is not the only trading platform dealing with more trading action as nearly every exchange is experiencing increased demand. Also read: Crypto Tales Pt. 1: Odd Stories That Surface in Bitcoin-Land May 25th was a hectic day in Bitcoin-land as trade volumes hit an all-time high of over $2.4 billion during the day. Many traders are making moves to accumulate profits by day trading or utilizing intra-range strategies. Although quite a few exchanges have been having a difficult time dealing with the demand, Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, increased customer support, and even keeping their website online. This includes well-known exchanges like Coinbase, Kraken, and Bitstamp as the companies have issued statements, and across forums, customers are complaining. Last week Bitstamp explained to its clients that increased demand has put a lot of pressure on the company. “As digital currencies continue to gain in popularity, the increase in the number of new traders on exchanges like ours can exert significant pressure on the customer service team,” details Bitstamp. “Our duty to fulfill our compliance obligations also means that there are limits as to how much of the onboarding process can be automated, which imposes additional demands on our staff.” The cryptocurrency brokerage service and exchange Coinbase is also dealing with increased trades and new customers. The exchange has been seeing nearly 100,000 new registrants per week and currently services 7.2 million customers. “The market cap of digital currencies has increased ~50 percent to $91 billion in the past week. As a result, Coinbase has seen a dramatic increase in traffic and trading volume,” the firm told the publication Techcrunch in a statement.    Additionally, many of these trading platforms have been suffering through DDoS attacks which have been a common occurrence for exchanges this month. On May 7 the San Francisco-based Kraken exchange experienced a severe DDoS attack dealing with Ethereum trades, which “cascaded margin liquidations on the ETH/USD order book.” Throughout these moments of frustration, traders believe bitcoin exchanges should guarantee 100 percent uptime. Kraken’s founder and CEO Jesse Powell explains that type of request is unrealistic. “Unfortunately, this is not realistic at our price point. Even giants like Amazon and Google are not completely immune to DDoS,” Powell stated during the company’s May 7 DDoS attack.  Trading platforms that are lagging and suffering from lots of customer support request are definitely irritating bitcoin traders. Some are even complaining about charts not working correctly which is not an ideal situation for traders. However, the increased demand has pushed bitcoin’s value way up the price ladder and not too many people are complaining about that. Traders hope that with all the new money flowing into these exchanges they will hire more employees and tighten up their company’s DDoS mitigation defenses. What do you think about global exchanges having issues keeping up with demand? Let us know in the comments below.

Multiple news reports featured in prominent publications and on television are saying mainstream investors are flocking to cryptocurrencies in great number. Also read: Are Asian Markets Creating a Bitcoin Price Bubble? Mainstream media is giving Bitcoin a lot of attention because the digital asset’s market value has gained significant value in a short period of time. To put the jump in value into perspective, bitcoin’s price has risen by 87% in just thirty days. Now many broadcasts and publications are reporting on bitcoin nearly every day giving the technology quite a bit of exposure. Bitcoin can be seen on television as news broadcasts such as Fox, NBC, and CNBC are reporting on the subject regularly. Additionally, the decentralized currency is being featured in editorial publications such as Market Watch, Time Magazine, Forbes, Business Insider, Bloomberg, and the New York Times. For instance, on May 26 the investment news outlet Market Watch headline reads;      More mainstream exposure happened last week as the American socialite and professional poker player, Dan Bilzerian, told his 22.3 million Instagram followers he was buying a lot of bitcoin. “Just bought a sh*tload of bitcoin — it’s so crazy watching that sh*t f**king go up it’s like… betting a bunch of money on the Super Bowl,” explained Bilzerian. The well known IG financial analyst Chris Weston also notes the new money flowing into bitcoin is huge. “I genuinely can’t wait to see young tech heads driving down Collins Street in a new Aston, because they had the stones to be able to hold their exposure through what has been an exponential move without ever having taken profit,” explains Weston.   Moreover, on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation’s (ABC) nightly news brief the host detailed that bitcoin could possibly replace the U.S. dollar. During the newscast, ABC said there is a chance alternative monetary systems like cryptocurrencies can become the next de facto world currency in the future. Additionally, many investors were quite surprised to hear how much the Boston-based Fidelity Bank, CEO Abigail Johnson liked bitcoin. Fidelity has added Coinbase accounts to their online banking platform, and the firm has been mining bitcoin with 21 Inc. computers as well. Nick Kirk, a former IBM Researcher, explains, “They basically let the world know they are looking at it.” These days there is significant interest in cryptocurrencies stemming from Asia and not just from China anymore. India, Japan, and South Korea are starting to become dominant players within bitcoin trading markets. There definitely seems to be a whole lot of money moving towards cryptocurrencies like never before as the entire market capitalization commands a whopping $83 billion. These valuable currencies are also trading over $4.6 billion USD worth of cryptocurrencies daily, and bitcoin is capturing half this share all by itself. Last but not least another mainstream mogul also is very optimistic in regards to bitcoin adoption.

The price of bitcoin soon fell sharply before reaching $2,800 as she predicted. She also gave some price forecasts, warning of a downturn for the rest of the year but record highs in 2018. Also read: Fidelity Integrates with Coinbase, Mines Bitcoin and Accepts Bitcoin at its Cafeteria An analyst at Forex Analytix, Nicola Duke, uses a method called Fibonacci retracement to analyze the price of bitcoin as well as determine its support and resistance levels. This popular technical analysis tool is based on the idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move before continuing in the original direction. It looks at the peaks and troughs or rallies and falls of historical bitcoin prices in order to forecast future movements. “According to Fibonacci analysis, the way bull markets typically work is that you’ll have a pullback that stops when it retraces a key percentage of a previous move higher,” CNBC explains, adding that these key percentages come from Fibonacci Ratios. Examples of key ratios which technical traders like to use are .618, .786, 1.27, 1.618, and 2.618. Duke’s Fibonacci retracement analysis chart, using Bitstamp weekly prices going back to 2013, was published on Tradingview.com on Thursday. She indicated on the chart that $2,283 is the short-term trend support; another support level above that is $2,800. In addition, bitcoin has two major support levels below $2,283. They are $2,145 and the more likely $1750-80. Both are shown on her chart. In an interview with  CNBC on Thursday morning, Duke explained that “wave two” of bitcoin began in the fall of 2013. The price of bitcoin rallied sharply for several months before falling steadily. It bottomed out in January 2015, then began to climb again. Currently, bitcoin is in “wave three”, the publication relayed her findings: Duke expects this next wave, which is the fourth, to last 61.8 percent of how long wave two lasted. 61.8 percent is one of the key Fibonacci ratios. She believes that the rally after the correction would start in January. “We will see the bottom at the start of January, that is when stock markets typically tend to have a correction as well,” she noted, then explained to CNBC that: What do you think of this Fibonacci retracement analysis?

2017-05-26T12:42:58-04:00,Russia’s Central Bank Drafting Proposal to Classify Bitcoins as Digital Goods,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/russia-central-bank-proposal-bitcoins-digital-goods/,"The Central Bank of Russia has proposed classifying cryptocurrencies including bitcoin as digital goods for tax purposes, according to local publications. The draft proposal is due in one month. Also read: Russia Considers Recognizing Bitcoin in 2018 to Fight Money Laundering The Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Russia, Olga Skorobogatova, revealed on Thursday that the bank has proposed to classify cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin, as digital goods for tax purposes. Sputnik International reported her saying: According to Skorobogatova, the proposal was supported by all ministries, and the central bank is planning to deliver the first draft of the regulations in a month. This proposal follows her promise in February for the central bank to decide whether digital currencies are considered assets, cash or securities by mid-2017. According to RBC, a leading Russian media group headquartered in Moscow, the central bank claims that they need to start controlling cryptocurrencies in Russia or they can quickly become a threat. Since digital currencies are not backed by gold reserves and are not state controlled, the deputy governor said that they can lead to instability in the financial markets sooner or later. She then noted that cryptocurrency trading volumes in Russia have increased since last year, and said (loosely translated): The official government stance on cryptocurrencies has been under constant debate for years. Starting with a very strict stance favoring criminalization, Russian lawmakers have become more lenient over time as the benefits of blockchain technology became apparent in the country. In December 2016, Vadim Kaluhov, the Director of Financial Technology, Projects and Process Management at the Bank of Russia, warned the government against using excessive measures. He conveyed that if the regulations are too strict, then cryptocurrency transactions will move outside of Russia. “By pushing the process of exchange out of the country, we actually lower the level of security and stability,” he detailed. In January, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev told reporters that the central bank and the Federal Financial Monitoring Service had been watching bitcoin. They did not find it to be a threat. In April, he announced that the country was considering recognizing the digital currency in 2018 to fight money laundering. This month, the largest online retailer in Russia, Ulmart, announced that it will start accepting bitcoin payments in September. Meanwhile, trading volume has grown steadily. Localbitcoins, the most popular trading platform in Russia, shows that the country has the second largest trading volume, behind only China. Russia has seen over 400 million rubles worth of trading, or over $7 million USD in weekly volumes for three weeks in a row.  What do you think of Russia classifying bitcoin as digital goods?

2017-05-26T06:00:09-04:00,Are Asian Markets Creating a Bitcoin Price Bubble?,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/asian-markets-bitcoin-price-bubble/,"Bitcoin’s price has been rising so fast over the past two months people don’t know what to expect next. In Asia, the price is climbing higher than most western exchanges. Now many people are wondering how healthy the current price spike is and whether or not the digital currency is in a bubble that might be followed by a deep correction. Also read: Bitcoin Helps Venezuelan Families Avoid Starvation Everybody is extremely focused on the price of bitcoin and a number of altcoins increasing in value exponentially. Some people think the digital currency’s value gains are moving too fast while others believe overall global demand supports the price rise. Charles Hayter, founder, and CEO of the cryptocurrency data analysis firm Crypto Compare reached out to Bitcoin.com and detailed his opinion of the situation bitcoin markets are facing. Hayter believes the increase is a bubble formation but questions the level of speculation. Market bubbles can burst in a short period of time, but some bubbles have lasted years. “Media begets more price rises and triggers more exposure and buying,” explains the Crypto Compare founder. “The ICO phenomenon is contributing too as traders wash in and out of the major cryptos chasing and pumping the next ten bagger.” Currently, Asian bitcoin markets are seeing massive trade volume and higher prices per BTC in contrast to most exchanges worldwide. According to Hayter and Crypto Compare statistics, “Korean markets are buying Bitcoin at over $4000 – a $1400 premium or 50% premium to the USD price. Korean volumes hold 11% of total bitcoin trading.” Furthermore, prices are higher than the global average in Japan, India, and other regions as well. Alongside Bitcoin fever, Korea, and other Asian countries are also seeing significant Ethereum trade volume, as well as higher ETH price spreads. Hayter believes the recent scaling proposal introduced by Barry Silbert may have given traders some optimism, but he believes it is still “unclear if the agreement can be implemented.” However, because some companies like Bitmain and others who opposed supporting Segwit in the past have agreed to the compromise, Hayter believes we are moving in the right direction. “Both Bitcoin and Ethereum markets have seen global dislocation as price premia have appeared specifically on the JPY and KRW markets — Asian and more specifically Korean fever is taking hold,” Hayter adds. What do you think about Asian markets driving up the price? Do you agree with Charles Hayter that we are in a bubble at the moment?

2017-05-26T01:53:37-04:00,Bitcoin Price Falls Sharply After Nearing a $2800 All-Time High,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-falls-sharply/,"After rising exponentially for three solid days, bitcoin prices fell sharply on Thursday afternoon dropping over $500 in a four-hour period. The price has rebounded since the drop hovering above a $2300 per BTC average across global trading platforms. Also read: Leading Japanese ATM Manufacturer Oki Gets into Bitcoin ATM Business As the saying goes ‘what goes up must come down.’ At some point, a correction after Bitcoin’s intense bull run was to be expected. During the early morning in the Western Hemisphere on May 25, the price of bitcoin hit an all-time high of $2760 average across global exchanges. A few hours later the price took a downturn seeing a five leg drop to a low of $2221 per BTC. Of course many had expected the price to correct, but the degree was unknown. There wasn’t any bad news or headlines giving a reason for the dip. A lot of traders believe that it was a typical pre-weekend correction that has taken place every weekend for over a month and a half. The weekend prior to the Consensus 2017 conference in New York was the only exception as there was a lot of hype happening. Additionally, it’s the end of the month, and some traders believe people are merely paying their bills and more than likely most were just taking a profit.  At the time of writing, some technical indicators suggest we could still ride back up the ladder, while other trends tell a different story. Both moving averages still have a nice gap as the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still higher than the 200 SMA. Alongside this, the Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) still shows warnings of overbought conditions, but these signals have been saying that for the past two months consecutively. At press time looking at order books and market depth across a few top exchanges show there seems to be a strong floor in the $2000-2100 range. Even though the dip took place volume has been smoking hot with $2.3 billion USD worth of bitcoins traded on May 25. If the price kicks back into gear, it will likely test many resistance points above the $2500 range and higher. Overall bitcoin is still trending up looking at the chart’s weekly view, and the bull stampede may not be over. However many bitcoin traders have great recollections of the 2013 highs and the following year-long bear run in 2014 to a low of $180. Some are convinced there’s a possibility the downtrend pattern could happen again due to these memories of the past. Yet there are those who believe there are strong fundamentals keeping bitcoin’s price this high including more investors, media attention, and the overall rise of cryptocurrency adoption in general. Bear Scenario: After the recent $500 sell off bears may play their cards and shake more weak hands out. At the moment a drop to the $2000 range looks unlikely but could happen if bulls are exhausted or sitting out for lower levels. At press time bitcoin’s price is moving sideways just above the $2300 range. Bull Scenario: Bitcoin’s price has consolidated, and buyers can take the reigns once again. If resistance is broken above $2500 in the short term, then we could very well see some benchmark prices again. Markets are still very bullish, and volume is at unprecedented levels causing a few exchanges to lag over the past two weeks. What do you think about the price of bitcoin dropping to $2200?

The U.S. resident says his family lives in Venezuela and bitcoin is giving them the opportunity to purchase food and pay bills while the economy crumbles around them. Also read: South Korean Bitcoin Exchanges Trade $1000 Over Global Average There have been many reports of people residing in Venezuela turning to bitcoin to hedge against the country’s economic failures. Venezuelans have been using bitcoin because their national currency the Bolivar has been significantly devalued and citizens using the tender are suffering from over 1800 percent inflation. The enthusiast who detailed that bitcoin was saving his family from starvation wanted to let the public to know the potential for the cryptocurrency used in this fashion is way bigger than its use cases in the black market. “I want to debunk that myth and explain how real the potential for bitcoin is and how it is so much bigger than the black market can ever be,” explains the threads author. The author states that his father lost his air conditioning job some time ago, and his neighbors around him, even the upper class cannot afford food. He explains bitcoin being used by criminals is no different than then when they use cash for illegal activities. “If you take one step back you’ll realize that the possible legitimate uses for bitcoin are far greater than the black market.” In 2014 his family discovered bitcoin but were very skeptical about the digital currency, “but we didn’t have any other options,” the author details. The post also explains that many people are trading bitcoins underground to acquire either Bolivars or USD to purchase food and living necessities. Furthermore, some Venezuelans are using bitcoin for arbitrage opportunities as well. The interesting post about bitcoin saving the young man’s family was well received by the crypto-community. Additionally, a few other Venezuelans revealed how bitcoin was helping them and the methods they use to convert bitcoin into USD or Bolivars. Moreover, a couple individuals from the U.S. and other regions said that people from “well off” countries should not assume the economic situation in Venezuela will not happen to their economy. In their opinion Venezuela, Greece, and many other manipulated and centrally planned monetary systems worldwide are simply the first of many to fall.

Many traders are finding significant arbitrage opportunities due to South Korean spreads being over $1000 higher than the global average. Also read: Korea Steadily Becoming a Cryptocurrency and Fintech Hub  Bitcoin is very popular in South Korea at the moment. According to statistics, the country’s top three exchanges Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone are exploding with bitcoin volume over the past few months. The trading platforms are processing roughly $200 million USD worth of Korean Won-KRW/BTC trades daily, and lately, most of these trades have been well above the global average. Alongside this, the South Korean Localbitcoins volumes and spreads have been off the charts as well. The region has also been blossoming with startups dedicated to bitcoin remittance and financial tech advancement. The South Korean government has been very friendly towards digital currencies, and the country is steadily becoming a technology hub. Just recently the government lowered the equity capital requirement for bitcoin companies working with remittances. The new statutes will begin on June 18 with a reduction of required capital to 1 billion KRW in contrast to the prior requirement of 2 billion KRW. Additionally, researchers from the South Korean central bank recently released a report that detailed that virtual currencies like bitcoin can “coexist with fiat.”           “The recent emergence of digital currency opens up a new type of dual currency regime in which digital currency, which has no intrinsic value and a government-issued fiat currency coexist,” explained the researchers from Seoul’s Hongik University and members of the Bank of Korea’s (BOK) report. Besides the central bank’s and government’s friendly attitude the bitcoin community in South Korea is thriving. For instance, the Seoul Bitcoin Meetup group has over 1,200 members and has over ten upcoming meetings scheduled. This past March the group discussed the differences between soft and hard forks. South Korea is also home to three bitcoin automated teller machines (ATM) as well.  South Korea is fertile ground for cryptocurrency use with the country’s remittance market capturing billions every year. Korean remittances have undoubtedly bolstered bitcoin as startups like Korbit has pushed crypto-settlement forward. Financial incumbents like Shinhan Bank are also looking at bitcoin’s benefits towards the large remittance market in Korea. With all the feverish demand for cryptocurrency solutions and financial technology, Korea has positioned itself as one of the top five leading countries in bitcoin trade volume. It’s safe to say that when it comes to bitcoin adoption, Korea will be one to watch with its population of over 50 million, a multi-billion dollar remittance industry, and a government that bolsters fintech.

Also read:Â Leading Japanese ATM Manufacturer Oki Gets into Bitcoin ATM Business Wyre offers cross-border payments to large scale enterprises and payment companies using open blockchain technologies. Currently operating in the US, China, and Brazil, the company began offering an API and a client dashboard to their customers in the spring of 2016. At the end of last year, Wyre raised $4.5 million in a series A round funding. The company also claims to have moved over $1 million in payments per day by the fall of last year, according to its website. On Wednesday, May 24, WyreÂ announced: Using the bot platformÂ Recime, Wyre Bot was created for use across Wechat and Facebook to generate payment invoices as well as respond to customer support tickets via chat. âCurrently the botâs focus is on the invoicing piece of the payment,â Dunworth told Bitcoin.com. âWe’re just trying to tie the communication channel of Wechat into the westerners’ more used channels like email/Facebook,â he said, citing how this will reduce friction for businesses in China sending invoices. Wyre Bot currently supports USD payments to China, a channel the company calls its core focus. âWe’re going to be opening this up though in the near term and are already seeing some demand for new currencies,â Dunworth detailed. Additional currencies could include the Euro, British pound, Mexican peso, and Japanese yen. Furthermore, more functionalities could be added to the bot in the future, such as the ability to execute payments directly in the bot and multi-invoicing in one request. Another expansion plan the company is considering is adding more social platforms such as Whatsapp, Slack, Line, and Viber. Using a standard social chat window, the supplier first sends a message with the transaction details to Wyre Bot. The bot will then generate an invoice in aÂ .pdf format which is emailed to both the supplier and the person paying the invoice. Invoices are hashed, timestamped and stored on the Ethereum blockchain for fraud protection, according to Wednesday’s announcement. Dunworth explained to Bitcoin.com that this method is âa way for our clients to feel confident that the invoice they’re receiving was generated through our platform, instead of being from a spoofed email address that looks like it was generated by us,â adding that: The CEO went on to describe why they made the switch from Bitcoinâs blockchain to Ethereumâs. The company wouldÂ record these transactions on âthe Bitcoin blockchain but it’s too expensive to do that,â he shared with Bitcoin.com. The higher Bitcoin network fees restricted him from making hourly timestamps, which Dunworth said that his customers need. âSo it’s either we put it on once per day,â he continued, âwhich means our customers can’t verify their invoiceâ as often, or âuse a cheaper chain and do it hourly. So we opted for the latter.â However, he hinted that in the future, Bitcoinâs blockchain may make a comeback, stating that: What do you think of Wyre Bot?

2017-05-24T12:17:12-04:00,"Bitcoin Price Blazes Past $2400 and Higher in Japan, India and South Korea",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-blazes-past-2400-and-higher-in-japan-india-and-south-korea/,"Bitcoin’s rising value continues to pick up steam this week by breaking a new all-time price high nearly every day. Currently, the global average is US$2400 per BTC, but the price is also trading at a premium of $2700 in Japan, $3050 in India, and $3150 in South Korea. Also read: Bitpay’s Bitcoin Prepaid Card Now Available to 131 Countries Since our last price post just four days ago, bitcoin’s fiat value has climbed $400 higher to an all-time high average of $2405 across most global exchanges. The bull run is showing unstoppable momentum with a few pit stops along the way as bitcoin’s market cap is just a few dollars shy of reaching $40 billion. Alongside bitcoin, many altcoins are also gaining in value at an unprecedented level not seen since 2013. Additionally, there has been significant demand coming from many countries globally, but in specific regions, the price is going through the roof. For instance, at the Japanese exchange Bitflyer, the price per bitcoin is trading at an average of $2700 at the time of writing. Moreover, most BTC/JPY exchanges are trading at this level. Another country that is pushing bitcoin demand higher is South Korea as prices are significantly above even Japan. The Korean trading platform Bithumb is trading BTC at a value of $3150 at press time. In India, bitcoin is trading at a premium for the past 48-hours as well, reaching $3050 on exchanges like Unocoin.  Weekly technical indicators suggest the rally may test ranges between $2500-2600 over the course of the next two weeks. As usual, the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is continuing to stay well above the 200-term SMA which means buyers are still in control. Over the course of the week, there have been sharp downswings intermittently ranging from $50-150 drops at times. Fibonacci retracement trend lines show some fluctuations as bitcoin’s current trajectory could slow up and may stabilize in the $2350-$2400 range temporarily. Both Relative Strength Index (RSI) and Stochastic oscillators show some bear traps could come at any moment in the short term. However, most technical indicators and rule books can be thrown out the window these days, as bitcoin’s rising price has surprised even the most experienced traders. Just as bitcoin has been performing phenomenally, there have been many altcoins doing just as well. The entire market is now valued at over $90 billion dollars, and most of the money piled up in just a few short weeks. The smart contract token Ethereum (ETH) is now commanding a $20 billion market cap as each ether is worth $220. Ripple (XRP) has stabilized and even dropped in value a touch at 34 cents per XRP and a 13 billion market cap. Alongside the top three many other coins throughout the top 20 list are catching waves of fresh new money. The cryptocurrency NEM is ($0.25), and Ethereum Classic (ETC) jumped considerably ($20.85). Meanwhile, Litecoin is back on the uptrend ($33) and so is Dash as the token has hit an all-time high of $150 per coin. Others such as Monero, Stellar, and Bytecoin have all made considerable advances as well. Furthermore, one notable surprise comes from Dogecoin markets which now hold the 11th position. The meme token is trying to enter the top ten list, and some hope Dogecoin will one day be worth a penny. In general most of the cryptocurrency community has been very positive over the past few weeks. A lot of announcements happened this week during Consensus 2017 from startups like Bitpay, RSK, and Shapeshift. Additionally, Barry Silbert introduced a compromise that seems to have a lot of backing from both bitcoin-based businesses and the mining sector. It’s not certain whether or not the agreement will mean anything or even happen, but there are many who are hoping for some kind of solution before bitcoin grows too popular. Lastly, the demand coming from places like China, Japan, India, and South Korea doesn’t seem to be slowing anytime soon. Bear Scenario: Seemingly there is a strong floor in the $2100 range at the moment but the price swings over the past three weeks show that floor could easily break. Over the course of the week, there is sure to be a bunch of volatility, so those making profits from intra-range and day trading will be in heaven. As said above swings have been ranging from $50-150 at times, so bears are undoubtedly playing their hands. Bull Scenario: Bitcoin has roared a few dollars past the $2400 mark and seems to be taking a rest after all that hard work. Bulls can definitely recharge their engines as they have done multiple times over the past two weeks breaking higher price barriers. Short term technical indicators have been at odds as bulls have held the reigns for a long time. $2500 to $2600 per BTC or an even higher exchange rate is not out of the question at the current rate of growth.                 What do you think about the price of bitcoin breaking $2400?

The company is testing Coinbase integration, is already mining some bitcoin using 21 Inc computers, and employees can now pay for their lunch with bitcoin at the company’s cafeteria. Also read: Leading Japanese ATM Manufacturer Oki Gets into Bitcoin ATM Business Ms. Johnson succeeded her father, Edward C. Jonhson, as the CEO of Fidelity Investments at the end of last year following his retirement announcement. Her father served as the CEO for nearly 40 years. The company currently has about $2.2 trillion in managed assets and manages retirement and savings plans for approximately 26 million people and 23,000 companies. Consensus 2017 was her first major speaking engagement since she became chairman of the company. Ms. Johnson talked about Bitcoin and blockchain technology while giving the audience a glimpse of Fidelity’s plans for them. She said: Ms. Johnson announced that Fidelity employees can now pay for their lunch using bitcoin at the company’s cafeteria at its headquarters. However, she said that so far fewer than 100 employees have used this option, adding that: She then went on to share the experience of one employee, Alex. The “Bitcoin Viking,” as she calls him, bought a beverage at the cafeteria and paid with bitcoin. He then tried to return the drink. “But the Bitcoin network was being spammed that day,” Ms. Johnson recalled, therefore “the return process was taking hours.” Alex then “gave up in despair,” she described then quoted him saying, “It’s like the matrix – I can’t actually use it in real life.” The usability of bitcoin is slowing down adoption, Ms. Johnson claims. “If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point of sale today, you are going to be disappointed.” However, she still has faith in the digital currency, affirming that: Another big announcement by Ms. Johnson involves an integration with the bitcoin exchange and payment processor, Coinbase. Since November 2015, the firm has been offering the ability for customers to contribute to their charitable giving accounts using bitcoin. So far, clients have donated $8 million worth, Ms. Johnson shared. Fidelity customers have expressed an interest in the ability to track their digital currency holdings through the Fidelity website, where they have other financial holdings, according to Ms. Johnson. This feature has been tested with employees and is already available to those with digital currencies at Coinbase, she detailed. Soon, it will roll out to all customers and they will be able to see their Coinbase holdings on the Fidelity website. Fidelity Labs, the firm’s research group, has made venture investments in a handful of Bitcoin businesses as well as partnering with university efforts, including the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Ms. Johnson revealed. “We have built proofs of concepts that accept bitcoin micro-transactions,” she detailed. In addition to micropayments, the firm is also exploring various use cases of blockchain technology through these partnerships. “Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle securities. It will fundamentally change market structures, and maybe even the architecture of the Internet itself,” she noted. Furthermore, Fidelity has set up computers built by 21 Inc to mine bitcoin. “We set up small Bitcoin and ethereum mining operations, just done in the spirit of learning,” Ms. Johnson said. So far, “my…computer has mined over 200,000 satoshis,” she conveyed: What do you think of Fidelity’s various Bitcoin projects? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-05-23T19:00:11-04:00,Purse Enters Multi-Million Dollar Bitcoin Development Agreement,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/purse-multi-million-dollar-agreement/,"On May 23 the bitcoin marketplace startup Purse announced a multi-million dollar bitcoin protocol development agreement with Bitmain Technologies, Bixin, F2 Pool, and Bitcoin.com. Funds will be directed towards hiring new developers and advance the development of the alternative Bitcoin client Bcoin.  Also read: Bitcoin Exchanges Multiply in Japan  The bitcoin company Purse has been bolstering the Bcoin implementation for quite some time now. Bcoin is a javascript client that is fully compatible with the latest version of the Bitcoin Core software written in C++. The protocol has been expiremented with on Bitcoin’s testnet and is also the only alternative code base that has been tested by miners on the main network (as it’s based on javascript and not Satoshi Nakamoto’s original C++ client). Bcoin has also been welcomed by bitcoin-centric companies such as Bitpay, Ripio, BTC.com, and Decentraland.  On May 22nd Purse founder and CEO Andrew Lee detailed that he believes multiple reference implementations and adding more developers to the ecosystem will benefit bitcoin, during a scaling panel at Consensus 2017. The Purse CEO said he was quite optimistic Bitcoin will scale this year as others on the panel like BTCC’s Bobby Lee, and Bitpay’s Stephen Pair agreed with him. Lee echoed the same sentiment during the multi-million dollar bitcoin protocol development agreement announcement as well. “For bitcoin to take off, we need multiple implementations with even market share,” said Purse CEO Andrew Lee. “Decentralizing protocol development will lead to multiple clients, diverse communities, more developers, better security, and more innovation.” The news follows Bitpay’s recent multi-million dollar agreement with Bitmain Technologies two weeks ago. The Atlanta-based bitcoin payment processor said a multi-year plan will advance open source software for miners, mining pools, and full node validators. “We believe that miners and mining technology providers like Bitmain play a vital role in the security and ongoing success of the Bitcoin blockchain,” explained Bitpay. The company last month also announced that it would help test the Bcoin implementation and extension blocks. Purse’s announcement details that participants of the agreement concurred that Bcoin developers will “retain full autonomy over the project and have not purchased an equity stake.” The Bejing-based Bitmain says they are impressed with the Bcoin software which is currently open sourced under the MIT license. Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu has stated in the past that he thought the Bcoin client was interesting being a fan of alternative implementations of the Bitcoin protocol. “We’re impressed with the team’s technical capability and professionalism,” said Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu during the announcement. “Further, they’ve already demonstrated the ability to execute and innovate.” The recent partnerships and alternative client research and development comes at a time when many bitcoin enthusiasts would like to see the network scale. The network has been limited to its transaction capabilities of only three transactions a second and miner fees have been rising exponentially as bitcoin’s fiat value increases. Since there has been no solutions supported by the vast majority, many alternative clients like Bitcoin Classic, Unlimited, and others have started to gain popularity.  With the help from Bitmain Technologies, Bixin, F2 Pool, and Bitcoin.com, Purse hopes they can push Bcoin to the next level and add more diversity to the bitcoin development scene.

The announcement states the signed agreement represents a “critical mass of the bitcoin ecosystem” with 83.28% of hash power supporting the proposal.  Also Read: Sidechain Juggernaut RSK Labs Launches Ginger Testnet After $3.5M in New Funding For a few days bitcoin enthusiasts have been anticipating the “Barry Silbert” scaling plan  hinted at a few days ago. Following Silbert’s statements about a new scaling effort, a meeting took place in connetion to the Consensus 2017 conference. As the conference came to an end, Silbert’s venture capital firm DCG revealed the compromise proposal.  The agreement is supported by 56 digital currency companies stemming from 21 countries worldwide. The letter states the agreement has the backing of over 83 percent of the network’s hash power. This group represents 5.1 billion USD monthly on chain transaction volume and 20.5 million bitcoin wallets within the economy. “We agree to immediately support the following parallel upgrades to the bitcoin protocol, which will be deployed simultaneously and based on the original Segwit-2Mb proposal,” explains the DCG announcement.   Prior to DCG’s announcement discussions of lowering the Segwit threshold that took place during the Consensus 2017 scaling panel, Eric Lombrozo stated it was possible to lower the Segwit threshold. After the discussion on May 22, Bitcoin developer James Hilliard proposed a “Reduced signaling threshold activation” BIP. “I would like to propose an implementation that accomplishes the first part of the Barry Silbert proposal independently from the second: ‘Activate Segregated Witness at an 80% threshold, signaling at bit 4,’” explains Hilliard. “The goal here is to minimize chain split risk and network disruption while maximizing backward compatibility and still providing for rapid activation of Segwit at the 80% threshold using bit 4.” Some of the notable companies and people that agreed to this Segwit activation compromise include Decentral, Grayscale investments, Jaxx, Bitmain, Xapo, Yours, Bitpay, Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin.com and Guy Corem. The medium article further suggested the community is prepared to handle any growing pains as a cohesive whole that has proven technical compromises can be made in the most challenging and high-risk environments. The consensus article echoed this sentiment: “We are also committed to the research and development of technical mechanisms to improve signaling in the bitcoin community, as well as to put in place communication tools, in order to more closely coordinate with ecosystem participants in the design, integration, and deployment of safe solutions that increase bitcoin capacity.” Do you think this concludes the mining debate?

Last week, the Indian government started soliciting public comments on how digital currencies should be regulated. Also read: India’s Government Forms Committee to Investigate Bitcoin, Report Due in 3 Months  The Indian Government’s Ministry of Finance on Saturday announced that the public is now invited to submit feedback or suggestions regarding the digital currency framework on Mygov.in. This website is designed, developed and hosted by the government of India’s National Informatics Centre of the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology. The deadline for submissions is May 31. This move follows the recent constitution of an inter-disciplinary committee by the Ministry of Finance’s Department of Economic Affairs “to examine the existing framework” of cryptocurrencies. The Indian government wants to know “whether Virtual Currencies (VCs) should be banned, regulated or observed?” according to the first question listed on the Mygov website. For those suggesting regulation, the government further asks: For those suggesting that virtual currencies should not be regulated, the government then wants to know: At press time, over 120 comments have been submitted. The majority of them are in favor of regulating bitcoin and other digital currencies, citing they are “the future.” However, one user noted: Many comments suggest that by legalizing bitcoin and other digital currencies, India could take the lead in digital currency adoption and the development of blockchain technologies. Citing how Japan recently recognized bitcoin as a method of payment, a comment reads, “bitcoin should be introduced in India asap like in other developed nations.” Another proponent of legalizing bitcoin pointed out that “most of the countries already made it legal. It will definitely help boost the Indian economy.” Among positive feedback are also ones which warn the government about the danger of bitcoin such as the recent Wannacry ransomware scare. One user wrote “bitcoin is very dangerous for the country. It is suicidal for the Indian economy,” citing its use by terrorists and criminals. Another commenter claimed, “to allow bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency will be a disaster, it will lead to the outflow of black money easily.” A cyber dispute risk management consultant, Vijayashankar Na, also known as Naavi, also voiced his opinion. He suggested banning bitcoin and all other cryptocurrencies, claiming that the government has been misled by people with vested interests in the digital currencies. However, there were also comments that urge the government to consider regulating bitcoin rather than banning it. One noted that “the main thing is to stop the misuses of cryptocurrencies instead of banning,” adding that “banning is not a solution, it is an action against innovation and technology.” This sentiment was echoed by another user who believes that “regulating it [bitcoin] is the solution and not banning it.” There was also a comment which devalued all other comments. The user suggested that the Indian government already has the “most dependable and knowledgeable people” who can give advice on the matter. “I feel that public opinion in such matters should not be considered,” he wrote, adding that “all pros and cons should be discussed in parliament on advice given by a team of economists with the government.” Do you think the Indian government will ban, regulate or just observe bitcoin?

Japan’s leading printer, info-telecom and ATM manufacturer, Oki Electric Industry Co Ltd, has entered into the Bitcoin ATM business. Their first line of Bitcoin ATMs is launching this month. Also read: The Japanese are Using Bitcoin More than Expected Founded in 1881, the Tokyo-based Oki Electric Industry Co. Ltd (Oki) manufactures and sells products, technologies, software and solutions for telecommunications systems and information systems. Among other offerings, Oki supplies ATMs, cash-handling equipment, bank branch terminals for financial institutions, automated check-in machines as well as ticket reservation and cash-handling equipment for the retail and service industries. The company claims to be the first to develop the world’s first cash recycling ATM in 1982. These ATMs recycle banknotes by taking deposits from customers and dispensing them to other customers who withdraw cash at a later time. They are expensive but are more efficient and save on the cost of labor. According to London-based Retail Banking Research, there were 3.3 million active ATMs in 2016, about 30% of which were cash recycling machines. Oki’s corporate brochure says: The Recycler G7 (RG7) is the company’s latest line of legacy ATMs, which is the seventh generation of its cash recycling machines. According to Nikkei Asian Review, the company’s next line of ATMs will be launching this month, and they will be Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs). The Recycler G8 (RG8) will allow customers to withdraw local currency from their bitcoin wallets as well as charge expenses to them. The publication describes: There will be other functionality as well, such as settling payment on invoices sent via smartphone. The features an ATM will have depend on the country where it will be located and what services local banks offer. Initially, Oki aims to launch the new machines in China and other emerging nations. “Oki has no plans to deploy the ATM back in Japan yet, given the relatively quiet demand for bitcoin by financial institutions here,” Nikkei Asian Review wrote. While the company has not announced where these Bitcoin ATMs will be installed, the RG7 units are installed in high foot-traffic areas such as international airports in Narita and Haneda, and other commercial facilities in Japan. In June last year, Oki installed 600 RG7 units in the State Bank of India, which is the largest bank in the country.

When approval is granted, companies can leverage LedgerX’s platform to acquire bitcoin using exchange-traded and other centrally regulated distributed contracts. “We believe a regulated bitcoin market could substantially expand the bitcoin economy. In this regard, a vibrant options market, which LedgerX plans to build, is a critical foundation to the entire ecosystem,” said James Wo, President of Huiyin Blockchain Venture Investments. The president of LedgerX, Paul Chou, also commented on investments inside the bitcoin space: This new investment opportunity comes as bitcoin’s price hits $2275 on coinmarketcap.com. It appears the rising price and Japan’s recent acceptance of bitcoin has created a massive upward trend in the global ecosystem. Now, investment firms and hedge funds have taken an even more keen interest in developing strategies and expanding their regulated portfolios to include more bitcoin options. The primary company involved in the recent investment options, Miami International Holdings, Inc., is the parent company of Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (MIAX Options) and MIAX PEARL, LLC. The press release by LedgerX says that MIAX already offers trade options in 2,600 different classes. This implies bitcoin and other digital currencies will expand the company’s global monetary influence. This will put bitcoin into the U.S. securities and exchange limelight as the cryptocurrency tries to edge toward a price point of $3,000.

Now one of Japan’s largest discount airline providers Peach Aviation Ltd. has announced it will be the first Japanese service to accept bitcoin for airline tickets. Also read: Bitcoin Pizza Day: Reliving the Memories and Forging New Ones Headquartered in Osaka Japan, Peach Aviation is a well known Japanese air carrier service offering low-cost air travel since 2011. The company stated that bitcoin will be accepted for flights and services at some point towards the end of 2017. Peach said the recent law change regarding the digital currency had bolstered the business move. According to reports Peach also plans to introduce bitcoin to other partner companies and local governments. “We want to encourage visitors from overseas, and the revitalization of Japan’s regions,” Shinichi Inoue, the founder and CEO of Peach explained. “This is a real first step in partnerships for Japan, and we are aiming for more company and service tie-ups.” The news of Peach Aviation accepting bitcoin follows other merchants in the region accepting bitcoin like the company Bic Camera. Furthermore, the announcement comes at a time where Japanese bitcoin trade volumes and price spreads have been through the roof. According to Charles Hayter of the bitcoin data and analysis website Cryptocompare at the moment in Japan, “USD-BTC markets are trading at $2100 whilst the JPY-BTC pair is trading at the equivalent of $2500.” Over the course of the past 32 hours, the decentralized currency has been trading at a 19 percent premium, and Hayter says it is due to “Bitcoin fever taking hold.”  The country has taken the spotlight in overall global BTC volume as Japanese volumes are 42-50% of trading with 132k BTC volume or $300 million per day, explains the Cryptocompare founder. Hayter describes the current trading environment in Japan stating;          The Japanese Peach Aviation will join other global airline services that accept bitcoin for flight tickets like the Latvian airline, Airbaltic, LOT Polish Airlines, and more. Alongside this, bitcoin businesses like Coincheck and Bitflyer aim to sign up thousands more Japanese merchants this summer. As bitcoin fever takes hold in the country, Japanese residents from the region and international travelers will be pleased to know they can fly to over 22 destinations across Asia utilizing bitcoin as a form of payment.

This week one of Michigan’s largest and oldest lawn equipment and power sports stores — Ball Equipment is now accepting bitcoin. Also read: Petition Asks SEC to Clarify Rules on Bitcoin and Digital Token Assets    The fourth generation family owned superstore, Ball Equipment, is one of Eastern Michigan’s largest and oldest outdoor power equipment dealerships operating for over 73 years. The store has two locations that sell heavy duty lawn equipment and power sports gear from brands like Polaris, Honda, Can-Am, Cub Cadet, and Husqvarna. This week the business decided to accept bitcoin allowing any of their customers to purchase rideable lawnmowers, ATVs, snowmobiles, dirt bikes and more. Bitcoin.com talked to Chris Ball, one of the owners of the Michigan state superstores to see why the business decided to start accepting bitcoin. Mr. Ball says that even though they are an old and well-established company the team has always had the corporate philosophy of “getting ourselves outside the ‘we have always done it this way’ box.” “The quickly evolving world of cryptocurrencies and the media attention it has received is something that attracted our interest. Even before fully understanding it, we knew it was something we should work towards adopting immediately,” explains Mr. Ball. Mr. Ball tells us there are other reasons why the company decided to accept the digital currency. “For instance, many of the larger ticket items Ball Equipment sells like the ATV’s, and Motorcycles, are typically very low margin products to retail to consumers,” the Ball Equipment executive details. “In addition, becoming an early adopter in our very ’old school’ industry gives us the potential to do business on a local and even national level that we would otherwise not have the opportunity. Considering we have found very few of our competitors anywhere accepting bitcoin currently, we do not see much if any downside other than accepting the risk of short term bitcoin value fluctuations.” As of today, Mr. Ball says customers can stop in one of the Ball Equipment showrooms or visit the website, browse the selection of vehicles and products, and then fill out a request quote form to let the company know you are interested in a purchase with bitcoin as a payment method. “A member of our sales team will follow up to provide a quote and once a final decision is made an invoice will be provided with a QR code from our wallet to send coins for payment,” Mr. Ball explains. As Bitcoin.com explained last week, as the digital currency continues to see more popularity the trend also follows with people purchasing luxury goods, real estate, and high ticket items. Merchants like Ball Equipment are starting to see the value in opening up sales to a new customer base, a currency that appeals to profitability and allowing their business model to stay on course with the future of payments.

2017-05-22T06:00:02-04:00,Bitcoin Pizza Day: Reliving the Memories and Forging New Ones,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-pizza-day-memories/,"Today cryptocurrency enthusiasts around the world are celebrating the notorious “Bitcoin Pizza Day” where two Papa John’s pizzas were purchased for 10,000 BTC. Not only is the transaction deemed the first bitcoin exchange for real-world value, the trade is now appraised at US$20 million at today’s exchange rates. Also read: Asset Managers Recommend Bitcoin to Hedge Against US Stock Market Risks The Bitcoin network had been in operation for a little more than a year on May 22nd, 2010 when a developer named Laszlo Hanyecz purchased two pizzas using the forum Bitcointalk.org. The trade Hanyecz made that day is widely celebrated every year by bitcoiners as it is considered the first real-world transaction using bitcoin as a medium of exchange. “I’ll pay 10,000 bitcoins for a couple of pizzas.. like maybe two large ones, so I have some leftover for the next day — I like having leftover pizza to nibble on later,” explained Hanyecz. After Hanyecz had published his post, a few bitcoin enthusiasts talked about making the trade with him. A couple of people contemplated a few ways they could get the pizza to Hanyecz who was living in Florida at the time. A whole day passed, and Hanyecz writes “So nobody wants to buy me a pizza? — Is the bitcoin amount I’m offering too low?” Another 24 hours later Hanyecz announces that a successful transaction was made thanks to a user named “Jercos.” “I just want to report that I successfully traded 10,000 bitcoins for pizza,” the developer tells people on the thread. A few commenters thought it was great the exchange happened and congratulated Hanyecz that day. The 73-page thread discussion has been kept alive for years, with people commenting on how expensive the pizzas became as time had passed. Years later the transaction is considered one of the greatest moments in Bitcoin history and the two pizzas purchased for $25 USD is now worth over $20 million. Hanyecz did an interview with the New York Times a few years later reminiscing about the infamous day.      “It wasn’t like Bitcoins had any value back then, so the idea of trading them for a pizza was incredibly cool,” Hanyecz told the publication. Today as bitcoiners celebrate Bitcoin Pizza Day they’ll always wonder how those pizza’s tasted and whether or not Hanyecz really doesn’t regret eating the most expensive pizzas sold on the planet. As long as the pizza didn’t have weird toppings like fish, Hanyecz was pleased with his decision to offer 10,000 BTC for two pies. “I like things like onions, peppers, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes, pepperoni, etc.. just standard stuff no weird fish topping or anything like that. I also like regular cheese pizzas which may be cheaper to prepare or otherwise acquire,” Hanyecz said at the time. There will be a lot of people enjoying Bitcoin Pizza Day in 2017 as the decentralized currency is more popular than ever before. There are businesses such as the Bitcoin Store featuring specialty pizza-themed goods, and some merchants are offering discounts like the artist Satoshi Gallery.  Additionally, the German-based bitcoin banking startup Bitwala recently started a campaign so the cryptocurrency community can donate pizza slices using bitcoin to refugee kids in Berlin. All the proceeds will go to Champions Ohne Grenzen, a Berlin-based NGO that works with children. Every week they hold football training sessions with qualified coaches to empower kids and help them overcome trauma. People from all around the world sent in their donations and the money received will help provide more than 100 slices to the refugee children. “The fact that someone halfway around the world can have pizza delivered to war fleeing refugees without having to enter credit card info is a great and humane way to explain the power of bitcoin,” explained Bitwala’s CEO Jörg von Minckwitz. What do you think about the two pizzas sold for 10,000 BTC? Would you have regretted this decision now? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

2017-05-21T19:00:45-04:00,Three Services That Aim to Create Bitcoin Professionals and Experts,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/three-services-bitcoin-professionals-experts/,"Bitcoin can be a very technical subject, and oftentimes people have to find various resources online to educate themselves. However, there are a few organizations that instruct cryptocurrency enthusiasts through training and curriculum in order to edify the growing field of bitcoin professionals. Also read: The Case for Using mBTC Over BTC Denominations As the bitcoin economy grows, there are many people looking to learn about the bitcoin protocol and the growing cryptocurrency ecosystem. A leading-edge network of professionals that understand the technology is needed to bolster the innovative technology into the future. In 2017, there are few ways an individual can become a certified bitcoin professional to advance their knowledge and careers. The Cryptocurrency Certification Consortium One educational program called the Cryptocurrency Certification Consortium (C4) teaches students how to be certified bitcoin specialists. C4 has three types of courses that enable people to become either a Certified Bitcoin Professional (CBP), a Certified Bitcoin Expert, and a Certified Ethereum Developer. A graduating CBP claims to give an individual a significant grasp at understanding the bitcoin protocol, transactions, and network operation. “CBPs are able to apply Bitcoin technology to their professional area of expertise and understand privacy aspects, double-spending, and other issues that relate to the currency,” explains the educational consortium. The cost to become a CBP involves two years of study at the cost of $95 for the course and a $30 renewal fee. A CBX gives an individual “expert-level knowledge” about bitcoin, says the consortium. C4 also claims the certification gives a person the ability to develop blockchain applications as well. “CBXes understand how peers communicate on the Bitcoin network, how transactions are crafted at the byte level and how Bitcoin scripts can be written to customize the behavior of transactions,” C4 details. This course is three years long but is not yet available to students. The consortium is backed by a board of directors which include Andreas M. Antonopoulos, Vitalik Buterin, and Michael Perklin. Furthermore, C4 has well-known advisers such as Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson, Director of the Bitcoin Education Project, Peter Todd, Bitcoin Core Developer, and Steve Dakh, author of Kryptokit and Rushwallet. Digital Currency Council The Digital Currency Council (DCC) was created in 2014 in New York by David Berger, the school’s founder and CEO. DCC claims to have over 1500 members from 90 countries worldwide utilizing the organization’s digital currency training, and certification. The group calls itself an “association of professionals in the digital currency economy.” The DCC Professional Certification Training Program is shorter than the two-year consortium course with only a seven-hour online program. However, the course is far more expensive costing $299 for students taking the final exam. The DCC advisory faculty covers the six sections called “core competencies” which include cryptocurrency technical underpinnings, monetary implications, practical use, bitcoin’s ecosystem, accounting, and legal subjects. DCC also offers a self-assessment test to see if you qualify for the certification training program. The school is also backed by Barry Silbert’s Digital Currency Group and the Silicon Valley accelerator 500 Startups. “The DCC Certification, like other professional certifications, allows us to hold professionals who are advising clients to a higher standard, and provide a benchmark for evaluating skill and professional value,” Barry Silbert, CEO of the Digital Currency Group explains on the DCC website. Coursera: Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies Princeton’s Coursera computer science class called “Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency Technologies” is a free course from Princeton University. Assistant Professor Arvind Narayanan instructs the class on a variety of lessons that cover the innovative technology at a “technical level.” The next class begins on May 15 and begins to discuss cryptographic building blocks and introduces the concept of cryptocurrency. “After this course, you’ll know everything you need to be able to separate fact from fiction when reading claims about Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies,” explains the Princeton Coursera website. “You’ll have the conceptual foundations you need to engineer secure software that interacts with the Bitcoin network. And you’ll be able to integrate ideas from Bitcoin in your own projects.” The Coursera class is eleven weeks long discussing subjects like decentralization, the mechanics of bitcoin, regulation, mining, altcoins, and more. Every week the course offers an interactive textbook, pre-recorded videos, quizzes, and projects. Furthermore, students can connect with other peers and converse about course material. There are other ‘certification style’ digital currency education programs online but do some research on the course and organization before registering. Teaching a broader audience of professionals is a good idea to continue progressing the new digital economy. These types of certificate programs may even further an individual’s career, and it’s also possible to learn at home for free. Besides Coursera’s free course, there is a boatload of information on bitcoin and its technical aspects. However, people often enjoy a class setting and a certificate from an organization from accredited luminaries in the bitcoin space could go a long way. What do you think about these certification programs and courses covering the cryptocurrency environment? Let us know in the comments below.

The company has also retained the founder of Proof of Existence, Manuel Aráoz, as an advisor on future product development. Also read: Veriphant Helps Enable Legal Proofs in the Bitcoin Blockchain Founded in 2013 and headquartered in Beijing, Canaan Creative Co. Ltd (Canaan) produces Bitcoin mining rigs, designs ASIC microprocessors and operates data centers. On Sunday, May 21, the company’s Hong Kong-based subsidiary, Canaan.io, announced that it had acquired Proof of Existence from founder Manuel Aráoz. “The blockchain space offers us opportunities on the hardware side and on the services side,” said Xiangfu Liu, Canaan co-founder, adding that: Early this month, the company also announced that it had raised RMB300 million (approximately US$43 million) in a series A funding round. Its investors include Chinese hotel operator Jin Jiang International Group Co. Ltd, Chinese investment firms Baopu Asset Management Co. Ltd., and Tunlan Investment. The funding will support Canaan’s “upcoming 7nm designs and to enter the AI [Artificial Intelligence] market with its first Knowledge Processing Unit (KPU),” the company revealed on Sunday. Its products can be applied in AI fields including smart home appliance, autonomous driving, voice interaction and image recognition. Canaan is the company behind the Avalon mining family of hardware which produces ASIC mining chips and rigs. The line of hardware was launched in late 2012 and was the first to successfully pre-sell commercially available ASICs. Avalon mining rigs were sold and delivered before any other brands of ASIC bitcoin miners, even pre-dating the infamous Butterfly Labs brand, making it the oldest brand of Bitcoin mining equipment still in production today. When Avalon first debuted their then-powerful, 65 gigahash mining rigs on Ebay for $1,500, the response was so overwhelming that the last unit sold for over $20,000. Today, their 7.3 TH/s Avalonminer 741 sells for $715, as shown on Canaan’s website. Proof of Existence was another historic debut for Bitcoin. Launched on May 21, 2013, it was the first blockchain-based service to allow users “to publicly prove that you have certain information without revealing the data or yourself, with a decentralized certification based on the bitcoin network,” its website describes. According to Sunday’s announcement: The service offers document proofs that are stored on Bitcoin’s blockchain, without storing the document itself. The first of many similar services and protocols to do the task, Aráoz’s website uses a special bitcoin transaction that contains the hash in Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN script, embedding it into the bitcoin blockchain. It also lets users come back and verify their documents later. As part of the acquisition agreement, Canaan has retained Aráoz as an advisor on future product development and other blockchain related services. “Aráoz has agreed to continue on and advise the company on improvements to the product as well as other software services,” the company wrote. “The agreement ensures that there will be no interruptions in services and no changes in the API.” Commenting on the acquisition, Aráoz said: Aráoz, who lives in Buenos Aires, has been involved in many projects surrounding and supporting the Bitcoin ecosystem. Proof of Existence was his first, which led to him working for Bitpay in 2014, where he helped develop the popular Javascript Bitcoin library, Bitcore. That project led to the creation of Multipaper, the first multi-signature address paper wallet, which uses Bitcore. Then in May 2015, he created Streamium, a video livestreaming application like Periscope or Meerkat. Streamium was the very first application to use Nakamoto payment channels for micropayments while streaming live P2P video. Today Aráoz is working on Decentraland, a blockchain-based virtual reality project. What do you think of Canaan acquiring Proof of Existence? Let us know in the comments section below.

Also read: Asset Managers Recommend Bitcoin to Hedge Against US Stock Market Risks A research paper entitled “When Bitcoin encounters information in an online forum: Using text mining to analyse user opinions and predict value fluctuation” was published last week. It is co-authored by five researchers from two universities in South Korea; Korea University and Kangnam University. This study was supported by Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science, ICT and Future Planning. It is also funded by the Korean government through Institute for Information & communications Technology Promotion (IITP). “In order to predict the price fluctuation of bitcoin, we analyse the comments posted in the Bitcoin online forum,” the authors wrote, referring to the Bitcointalk forum, adding that: The method used in this study involves data extraction, data gathering, data analysis and model development. Keywords of interest from user comments were extracted as well as daily bitcoin transaction counts and prices. Data were crawled from the “Bitcoin Discussion” section of the Bitcointalk forum from December 1, 2013, to September 21, 2016. The daily bitcoin price and the number of transactions for the above period were crawled from Coindesk. In addition, Google Trends data and Wikipedia usage data were gathered using the keyword “Bitcoin”. The relationship between the Bitcoin transaction count and price based on the extracted keywords and quantification was analyzed. “Then, we developed a model based on deep learning to predict the Bitcoin transaction count and price,” the paper details. After extensive analysis, the researchers concluded: “Online user postings influenced Bitcoin transactions,” the authors found, claiming that their method shed light on some aspects of how comments affect users’ decisions to buy and sell the cryptocurrency. They then suggested various ways of improving the accuracy of prediction such as using quantitative analysis on search results or relevant content. Forum posts could also be filtered more meticulously for added accuracy. In conclusion, they asserted that their method “is conducive to understanding a range of cryptocurrencies other than bitcoin and increasing their usability,” adding that it can also be useful in many other fields.

The decentralized currency’s meteoric rise in value has captured a phenomenal $32 billion dollar market capitalization after eight tremendous years of growth. Also read: Petition Asks SEC to Clarify Rules on Bitcoin and Digital Token Assets 2017 has been an unbelievable year for cryptocurrency enthusiasts as they’ve watched bitcoin cross milestone after milestone. The digital asset is becoming widely known as a strong hedge against the turbulent global economy that continues to sink further every day. Many citizens from all around the world are clearly choosing bitcoin to hedge their wealth from deteriorating and to move their money however they see fit. This can be seen in countries like China, Japan, India, Venezuela, Russia, and more. Some of the momentous feats Bitcoin has reached this year include global trade volume topping over $1 billion USD worth of trades daily. Bitcoin’s hashrate has reached a whopping 4.2 exahash per second encouraged by the mining revenue that has also crossed an all-time high. The decentralized currency’s daily transaction rate is higher than ever before with over 326,000 transactions per day. Bitcoin has crushed nearly all of its records over the past four months and doesn’t seem to be slowing up. Mainstream media has been awfully kind to bitcoin as friendly headlines from publications like the New York Times, Bloomberg, Fortune, Time Magazine, and many others have shown bitcoin in a positive light. The articles are very different from the editorials in the past calling bitcoin doomed, dead, worthless, tulip mania, and yes even beanie babies. Now mainstream media is calling bitcoin worthy of an investor’s portfolio, a “safe haven,” “store of value,” “digital gold,” and many other kind words. The $2000 price is just shy of two days before the infamous pizza day where a pie from Papa Johns was sold for 10,000 bitcoins ($20M USD). Furthermore many bitcoiners can still remember the days when bitcoin reached parity with the U.S. dollar, silver, and this year surpassing 1oz of solid gold. Bitcoin has been in the movies, in songs, books, television shows, and even on the Simpsons. Overall bitcoin has had a very memorable life over the course of its short existence of only eight years. Many people, businesses, corporations, governments and think tanks mocked bitcoin and said it would never last, but now the digital currency is stronger than ever. Bitcoin has accomplished all of this without any rulers and has allowed people the ability to do what they want with their money without asking permission.

2017-05-19T10:57:20-04:00,Bitcoin Price Climbs Towards the $2K Range,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-climbs-towards-the-2k-range/,"The price of bitcoin has hit a new all-time high once again as the digital currency has reached an average of $1950 across global exchanges. If bitcoin breaks the $2K range the price will have doubled since the beginning of the new year. Moreover, 2017 has shown digital assets, in general, have seen significant gains which has created a remarkably large cryptocurrency market capitalization of over $66 billion.   Also read: Is It Too Late for Barry Silbert’s Scaling Compromise Proposal? Cryptocurrency trading volumes and digital asset values have been on a tear since the beginning of 2017. Right now all 700+ cryptocurrencies command a $66 billion market capitalization with bitcoin capturing 48 percent of that share. During the first week of January bitcoin crossed the 4-digit price territory at $1,000 per BTC, and now four months later one bitcoin is worth $1950. Bitcoin trade volumes across global exchanges have been trading at close to $1B worth of BTC trades per day. 24-hour volume statistics for all cryptocurrencies have been roughly $2.1 billion traded on a daily basis. Trade volumes on all exchanges have been growing exponentially as trading platforms like Coinbase, Kraken, Shapeshift, and Poloniex are reporting a heavier influx of daily transactions. For instance, Coinbase has reached 7 million users adding over 100,000 new registrants every week. Bitcoin charts and technical indicators suggest the rise should continue into the $2,000 range, but at the moment there are significant sell walls in that price territory. A price of 2K should be expected to be very psychological, and an immediate sell-off could ensue after it successfully reaches that point.  The 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still well above the longer term 200 SMA which shows buyers are not yet exhausted. Both the Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators are showing overbought conditions, but they’ve been indicating this for a while now. As stated above order books across the most popular global exchanges show a high of 2K will likely happen, but it may not last long. Bitcoin news has been very positive as mainstream media has printed a lot of headlines covering the decentralized currency’s performance. For instance, a recent CNBC article says bitcoin offers “portfolio protection” for people with investments and other publications are expressing the same sentiment.  The recent ‘Wannacry’ ransomware seemed to shed a negative light towards BTC, but most of the blame has been pointed at the NSA and the agencies backdoor corruption.  Meanwhile, bitcoin proponents have been celebrating the new highs but also tension has risen as the network has grown more congested and transactions now have much higher fees. The scaling debate seems to be escalating at the same rate as bitcoin’s fiat value rises. Lately, a lot of the scaling discussions have also shown people are trying very hard to find that one solution that will temporarily fix transaction throughput and maybe even willing to compromise. One forum comment expressed an interesting statement towards how some people feel about a compromise at this time; At the current rate of bitcoin’s value accumulation and the price approaching $2000, no one knows what to expect. There are those who feel nothing can go wrong as the bitcoin price train continue to chug upwards. Then there are those who are uneasy with the price being so high with the many unknowns facing bitcoin’s future. There are currently three main concerns at the moment for most bitcoin enthusiasts; the scaling dilemma, some exchanges have suspended withdrawals and the ever looming possibility of government interference. However watching bitcoin continue to gain value has caused a lot of excitement and exuberance as many hodlers have waited a long time to celebrate these milestones. Bear Scenario: At press time there is a seemingly solid floor in the $1800-1850 price territory if the price starts to slide, but a significant dip could easily break this ground. Bitcoin’s price is higher than it’s ever been and $2000 per BTC is a very psychological price point which could lead to some turbulence and bear traps. There have been plenty of dips and shorts over the past few weeks, and intra-range traders will likely continue to enjoy bitcoin’s volatility. Bull Scenario: Bitcoin’s current trajectory looks like it’s going to break the $2000 mark. If it breaks this resistance, the possibility of it going higher is probable, but many traders are vocally stating they expect an immediate sell-off. The $2000 per BTC price range looks as though it may happen in the short term and likely over the course of the weekend if momentum stays the same. At this current moment in time bulls are charging relentlessly and buyers don’t seem to be getting tired. What do you think about the price of bitcoin breaking $2K?

According to Reuters, reports that he “had tried to intervene in an investigation of alleged Russian meddling in last year’s U.S. presidential election, and that his aides had numerous undisclosed contacts with Russian officials, kept markets concerned over his ability to implement his economic agenda.” Although U.S. stocks mostly rebounded on Thursday, “investors may be looking for new bets in a market with growing uncertainty,” CNBC reports, adding that: Mark Tepper, President of Strategic Wealth Partners, warns against further U.S. market risks, telling CNBC that “it’s pretty obvious that political risk is shifting toward the U.S.” While acknowledging that U.S. markets have outperformed international markets over years, he now sees the trend reversing. While most investors are still overweight U.S. stocks, he noted that “global growth is so much stronger than U.S. growth.” Boris Schlossberg, Managing Director of foreign exchange (FX) Strategy at BK Asset Management, believes bitcoin is a good hedge going forward. In an interview with CNBC on Wednesday, he said the digital currency is the “new gold.” He then pointed out the similarities between bitcoin and precious metal which is often considered a safe haven asset. He said bitcoin is a suitable investment for investors wanting to protect their portfolios against further political risks, which he believes there may very well be. Bitcoin has had a 97 percent rally this year at press time, but he noted that its price is holding at very steady highs.  He further detailed when there is a big move in any type of investment instrument, “generally you’re going to have some continuation,” adding that: Schlossberg echoes Bobby Lee’s sentiment made in January in a different interview with CNBC. The CEO of the Chinese bitcoin exchange Btcc said, “when the existing money system has problems, people turn to bitcoin sort of like people used to go to gold in the old days.” Do you think bitcoin is a good hedge against U.S. stock market risks?

We are very happy to welcome EY to our fast growing community. ” This announcement comes after pro-bitcoin arrangements with the company were made. Last November, the advisory department of EY said they would be installing ATM’s in their corporate headquarters for their employees to use. Bitcoin.com’s Jamie Redman also covered EY’s recent adoption of Bitcoin ATM’s for employees who work inside the main building. EY said the company initiated this move to inspire awareness of digitalization among employees and customers: “The company explains the automated teller will be accessible to both EY employees and Swiss residents in the area. The Switzerland branch will also give employees an EY wallet app that enables ‘excellent protection against unauthorized access within the EY system environment.’ The main point of the new services and ATM is to drive digitalization awareness to EY employees and clients.” The overall goal of EY is to support local bitcoin organizations as well as to provide digital awareness. They seem to want to support local bitcoin organizations and functionaries. Their mission implies they are ready for a global business positioning shift, and this paradigm shift toward digital currencies seem to be their utmost priority. Marcel Stalder, the company’s CEO clarified “It is important to us that everybody gets on board and prepare themselves for the revolution set to take place in the business world through blockchains, smart contracts and digital currencies.” What do you think of EY partnering with the Bitcoin Association of Switzerland?

The company announced on Wednesday that it has reached the milestone of 500,000 downloads on the Android platform. In addition, more than 2,500 users are being added every day, indicating the “growing acceptance of bitcoin as one of the most popular emerging asset classes,” the company claims. According to Sandeep Goenka, Zebpay co-founder and COO: The Indian Finance Ministry is currently drafting rules for bitcoin and other digital currencies. This move is reportedly influenced by the rising market size of bitcoin and the number of its investors in India, coupled with reports of related fraud. In an effort to understand Bitcoin, the Indian government in April constituted a committee to investigate the digital currency, with a report due in July. According to India’s leading business daily publication Business Standard, a government official said: “Regulation will have a huge positive impact on this industry,” Goenka commented, citing Japan’s move to legalize bitcoin has propelled the country to become “the number-one country in the industry.” He also noted that Indian bitcoin exchanges are already self-regulated. The country has an association called the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India (Dabfi). It was formed by four Bitcoin companies, Zebpay, Unocoin, Coinsecure and Searchtrade, in February following a warning by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) about bitcoin and other digital currencies. Currently, a lawyer, Nishith Desai, is helping Dabfi draft self-regulatory rules. “Once that is complete, Dabfi will keep reviewing self-regulation processes of its members,” he detailed. Bitcoin.com recently reported on the rise of bitcoin demand as India’s cash reserves ran dry.

This year there’s been a lot more homes for sale from individuals posting ads on public websites like Craigslist and bitcoin-based businesses that are specifically tailored to selling real estate.   Also Read: Homeland Security’s U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Considers Bitcoin Just recently a person selling a brand new home in Vancouver announced that he was selling the US$3.5 million dollar house for 2099 bitcoins. The Hong Kong Craigslist post offers a nice Coquitlam home in British Columbia, Canada with all the fixings. The post asks for “serious inquiries only” and states the the house for sale is located in “one of the hottest markets on the planet.” The ad made headlines across various news outlets speculating this was a sign of how Chinese citizens are bypassing cash outflows by purchasing real estate. The publications Zero Hedge and the Huffington Post propose this may be how Chinese investors are moving significant amounts of funds out of the mainland. Another way a person can sell or buy a home for bitcoin is through the platform Bitcoin Real Estate. The platform is very similar to applications like Zillow and has quite a bit of real estate listings with prices denominated in BTC. Listing a home requires a simple registration process and buyers looking for a home can easily access the search settings that includes filters. Bitcoin Real Estate offers a variety of properties with a broad array of price ranges as some listings are just land and others can be million dollar homes. For instance, for around 755 BTC ($1.3M) an individual can purchase a luxury villa in Thailand at the Sanctum in Chiang Mai. The property comes with Smart Home capabilities, an Italian stone kitchen, a saltwater pool, four car garage, and even a nuclear fallout shelter. If you don’t have deep pockets, you can also purchase land that doesn’t have a house on the property for 17.5 – 35 BTC. There are many cheaper properties that can be found on Bitcoin Real Estate from places like Costa Rica, Mexico, Scotland, India and more. The Bitcoin Real Estate platform has 23 pages of listings for sales and rentals all around the world.  Individuals looking for more lavish real estate listings for bitcoin can shop for a home on Bitpremier, a Washington DC headquartered market that sells luxury items. Bitpremier has been around since 2013 and currently has ten pages of ritzy properties for sale in the real estate section. Not all the homes cost millions as there are a few properties listed for a few hundred thousand dollars worth of bitcoin. For 88 BTC a person can buy a five-star three-floor penthouse in Acapulco with two bedrooms. The home has a private beach, and the previous owner purchased the home for $174,000 USD worth of bitcoins back in 2013. For those looking to avoid a nuclear catastrophe Bitpremier also has fallout bunkers for sale as well. In the UK an individual can buy a nuclear bunker in the heart of the Norfolk Broads for around 95 BTC at the time of writing. The nearest neighbor is 500m away and the owner details the area with its 25m communications mast can also be rented to mobile companies. Buying real estate using bitcoin is not so unusual anymore as the market is growing alongside the cryptocurrency’s rising value. These days there’s a broad range of properties for sale with owners opting to accept bitcoin, by selling land, small condos, single family homes, and million dollar villas. The fact that you can buy and sell any property with cryptocurrency is showing bitcoin’s enormous strides as a valuable digital asset class for the 21st century.

They aim to attract Japanese retail investors, also known as “Mrs Watanabe”, who currently favor the $40 trillion foreign exchange margin trading market. Also read: Petition Asks SEC to Clarify Rules on Bitcoin and Digital Token Assets Since the Japanese government started recognizing bitcoin as a method of payment on April 1, online exchanges, funds and remittance companies have been racing to formally register with the FSA. “The process is expensive, demanding, laced with invisible tripwires and not all applicants, by any means, will be successful,” the Financial Times reports, adding that “the prize, though, could be spectacular.” By October 1, any bitcoin exchanges or money transfer businesses wanting to operate in Japan must be registered with the FSA and be submitted to annual audits. They have to comply with many new rules such as having extensive know-your-customer (KYC) processes and separate customers funds from their owns. Once registered with the FSA, these companies will be able to offer their bitcoin services and products to Japanese retail investors which largely comprise of Mrs Watanabe. The term Mrs Watanabe refers to Japanese retail investors, originally housewives trading online at home. They are historically risk-averse but now favor FX margin trading. Over the past decade, they have become a big player in currency trading to combat low-interest rates in Japan. According to a survey in April 2016 by the Bank of Japan which was published in September last year, the average daily turnover of the Japanese foreign exchange market was $399 billion. This translates to roughly $145 trillion annually. The Financial Times claims that the volume of FX margin trading in Japan is about $10 trillion per quarter which is approximately $40 trillion annually. The publication further notes: Mrs Watanabe has largely stayed away from bitcoin, opting for investments that are easier to understand. However, by recognizing bitcoin, the Japanese government has effectively demystified the digital currency. “Seeing the stamp of a regulator known for its conservatism” makes bitcoin attractive to Mrs Watanabe who may feel that the decentralized currency “is simply too lucrative a bet to pass up,” the publication asserts. While regulating bitcoin may be seen as an assertion of control by the Japanese government, Mike Kayamori, CEO of the bitcoin exchange Quoine, suggests there may be benefits this time, citing: Do you think “Mrs Watanabe” will start investing in bitcoin soon?

Also read: SEC Approves Petition to Review Bitcoin ETF Rejection Blockchain technology company Ouisa Capital has filed a petition with the SEC regarding the “regulation of the digital assets and blockchain technology.” According to the petition, the company is registered with the SEC and with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) as a broker-dealer and plans to use blockchain technology for its alternative trading system (ATS). The petition reads: In particular, the petition asks the Commission to provide guidance on: In addition, Ouisa proposes for the Commission to adopt a regulatory sandbox for digital assets, which some countries have already embraced including the United Kingdom and Singapore. Citing the similarities between digital assets and traditional assets, Ouisa believes that various applications of digital assets raise “the need for their regulation as securities.” This would apply to the issuance of digital tokens, the firm described, adding that: While the SEC has not provided guidance or adopted any rules regarding digital assets, it has evaluated them in the same was it does traditional assets, the petition notes. Moreover, the Commission has already “initiated a number of enforcement actions that provide a limited degree of regulatory guidance,” Ouisa wrote. In these actions, digital assets were considered investment contracts, which are actually securities, the firm described. This means they “are subject to state and federal securities laws and must be registered or exempt from registration.” Furthermore, the firms that facilitate their issuance or trading “must register as a broker-dealer, an exchange, or an ATS,” Ouisa further detailed. Two cases where digital assets including bitcoin were considered securities by the SEC were noted in the petition. In the cases of “Trendon T. Shavers and Bitcoin Savings and Trust” and “In the Matter of Erik T. Voorhees,” the Commission stated that: While the SEC stated that “it is clear that bitcoin can be used as money,” it did not address whether “bitcoins as units of digital currency constitute securities,” Ouisa added. Voorhees is a famous early Bitcoin adopter and creator of both Satoshidice and Shapeshift. The agency found him to “have improperly raised bitcoins by means of an unregistered sale of shares in entities that he owned,” and concluded that: These statements made by the Commission indicate that bitcoin and other digital assets are considered securities and platforms facilitating their issuance or trading must comply with traditional registration requirements. “It is also likely that peer-to-peer lending platforms that use digital assets may be required to register as broker-dealers or an ATS,” the petition notes.

The company also claims to be the first ewallet provider “to treat bitcoin like any fiat currency.” Merchants can now hold bitcoin in their accounts instead of having them automatically converted into fiat currencies. Furthermore, bitcoin payments are protected by Payza’s Resolution Center. Also read: Early Version of Tumblebit-Enabling Hiddenwallet Released Payment technology company Payza helps more than 13 million members in over 190 countries and 26 currencies process online payments. Monday’s announcement adds cryptocurrency exchange services to the mix. The company announced: Payza began offering Bitcoin services to account holders in August 2014, starting with the ability to buy bitcoin using funds in their Payza accounts. In October that year, the company announced a service to allow users to sell bitcoin in order to fund their Payza accounts. Customers’ bitcoins were automatically exchanged into USD “at a competitive exchange rate that is updated in real-time,” the company noted. Additional bitcoin services introduced on Monday include “instant bitcoin-fiat exchanges and the option to hold bitcoin alongside fiat currency within Payza ewallets.” Payza’s members can now hold bitcoins directly in their Payza ewallets, bypassing the need to have a separate bitcoin wallet to exchange between bitcoin and fiat currencies. Bitcoin can now be sent and received between Payza members instantly just like fiat currencies such as the USD, euros, or sterling, the company details, adding that: In May 2015, Payza launched a bitcoin payment option for merchants to accept bitcoin payments. However, these payments were immediately converted and settled in USD. While their customers could pay in bitcoin before, merchants did not have the option to hold bitcoin as they were all automatically converted into fiat currency. Now merchants who use Payza for online payment processing will have the additional option of holding bitcoin they receive. The company details: While Bitcoin transactions are irreversible, all purchases made in bitcoin through Payza’s online payment platform “will remain protected by Payza’s Resolution Center, a section within Payza accounts dedicated to resolving transaction disputes between buyers and sellers,” the company noted. According to Payza’s global executive vice president, Firoz Patel, more bitcoin and cryptocurrency features will be announced in the coming weeks and months.

On May 2 DHS awarded three blockchain-based startups $2.25 million for research and development. Following this announcement, the very next day Homeland Security’s USCIS department detailed they are considering bitcoin for U.S. Visa application and payment fees. Also read: Widespread Ransomware `Wannacry´ Linked to NSA Exploit      Three startups working with blockchain related technologies have been given grants worth $2.25 million USD to further their projects. The projects receiving DHS funding include Blockcypher, the bitcoin blockchain surveillance company, Digital Bazaar, a verification project, and Evernym a blockchain-based key management firm. Dr. Robert Griffin, the acting DHS Secretary for Science and Technology, said the funding would improve the country’s security in the long run.     “The Small Business Innovation Research Projects (SBIR) program enables us to capture some of the best scientific thinking to find solutions to apply in the current threat landscape,” explains Dr. Griffin. The U.S. agency has been bolstering blockchain projects for over a year now by funding a few projects within the landscape. Last year DHS awarded $200,000 USD to Factom for a blockchain-based identification system. Alongside the recent DHS funding during an EB-5 National Stakeholder Engagement on May 3rd, the Immigrant Investor Program Office (IPO) Division Chief Lori MacKenzie said the organization is considering bitcoin payments for services. Essentially this would open up the possibility for immigrants to pay Visa application fees with bitcoin. “USCIS is currently considering issues involving virtual currency such as Bitcoin,” explains MacKenzie’s National Stakeholder Engagement report. “USCIS cannot provide blanket assurances regarding any particular form of transfer, but we will continue to evaluate evidence provided by petitioners to determine whether the relevant statutory and regulatory requirements have been met, including evidence that the funds invested belong to the petitioner, and were acquired, directly and indirectly, by lawful means.” The U.S. government, in general, has been quite focused on digital currency solutions and blockchain concepts over the past year and a half. The latest DHS announcement is a continuation of the SBIR funding program and both Block Cypher, and Digital Bazaar has already received previous awards from the U.S. agency.  While the statements from USCIS are quite positive towards the bitcoin protocol, some cryptocurrency proponents believe it could add some legitimacy to the digital currency. “It legitimizes bitcoin in a completely new way and means that regulators have to consider the US government as a legitimate user of bitcoin when proposing regulation,” explains a bitcoin enthusiast after hearing the USCIS news.

Skandiabanken customers are now able to access Coinbase accounts giving members insight into their digital investments alongside their savings and checking accounts. Also read: Crypto Tales Pt. 1: Odd Stories That Surface in Bitcoin-Land Skandiabanken executives are starting to see bitcoin as an asset class for the 21st century. “We recognize cryptocurrency as an investment class similar to other securities,” Christoffer Hernæs, Skandiabanken’s Head of Innovation and Development explains to local news outlets. Skandiabanken conducts all of its services online and is currently the most popular internet bank in Norway. The bank believes customers will appreciate the new feature as it provides members with an overview of their digital investments. The service will initially only be offered to Skandiabanken customers using the bank’s payment platform. Hernæs details that cryptocurrency is still a very nascent technology and economy. “It’s still an early phase for cryptocurrencies,” Hernæs states. “It may be ok to test the waters, without jumping into it head first.” The new feature constitutes as the “first step in a direction we believe in,” explains the Skandiabanken executive. Currently, Norwegian tax officials classify bitcoin as a property and is a taxable income according to the country’s Tax Act. Hernæs says Skandiabanken customers will be notified of these requirements if they decide to utilize the bank’s bitcoin services. Members of the Skandiabanken Norway branch can also use the service to purchase bitcoins via Paypal’s payment processor. Although some banking authorities believe bitcoin may be a scary technology, Hernæs explains Skandiabanken believes it’s a good idea to be in lockstep with new technologies. “We acknowledge that this is something people want to put their money into,” says Hernæs. “Then we think it is the right time to look at new solutions we can offer. We think it’s a better approach than categorically thinking that this is scary.” The Skandiabanken feature is similar to the American financial services company USAA’s Coinbase integration. Back in November of 2015, USAA started a program allowing customers access to their Coinbase accounts using the firm’s online and mobile applications. Just like USAA’s program, Skandiabanken customers simply log into Coinbase through the bank’s login portal. Bitcoin.com also spoke with the founder of the Norway Bitcoin and Blockchain Association, Stephan Nilsson who says he’s pleased with the Scandinavian bank’s forward-thinking decision. “We were very pleased to learn about Skandiabanken’s new cryptocurrency feature and that they are recognizing cryptocurrencies as an investment class,” explains Nilsson. “This shows that the Scandinavian bank, that has been in the front line for many years as an internet-only bank, now continues to be a leader in the fintech area, embracing new technologies like cryptocurrencies.” “It represents a milestone in bitcoin usability when the everyday bank customer can handle cryptocurrencies in their web-bank just as easy as their savings and investment accounts,” Nilsson added.

The post on Reddit caused quite the stir for bitcoin proponents who thought the man was crazy to wager his home to purchase bitcoins at a very high price point. The thread was very controversial but received hundreds of upvotes over the course of the day. One person responds to the post saying, The shocking testimony also made headlines throughout various mainstream media outlets. The popular stock market publication Market Watch reported on the story as well explaining that the man may be setting himself up for financial disaster. While some people compared the terminally ill man to Walter White from the TV show Breaking Bad, some people wished the dying man the best of luck and hoped his wager paid off.     “I decided to make my newest lunge, using what equity I have accrued on my estate over the past ten years since the 2008 financial crisis,” the allegedly dying man writes. “If bitcoin reaches the 10k mark — which I see as a distinct possibility, or I would not have taken such a risk — I plan on moving to the West Coast and getting away from all the angry people here where I currently reside.” Another odd story concerning a guy contemplating robbing his friend’s stash of 70 BTC appeared on May 1. A chat discussion between a few people reveals the person left their Electrum seed out in the open and one of his ‘friends’ wrote down all the words. One person writes in response, “steal it dude, there ain’t no regulations in this motherfucker,” while others in the chat room called him a “shitty friend.” The same person who encourages the theft then goes on to say the money would uproot his life and he could just move.  Although the topic was rather negative, the post led to many bitcoiners discussing the best practices to store their seed phrases to avoid these types of situations. Some used methods like using the Cryptosteel device while others hid their seed phrases using words within books they owned. The conversation had evolved into many descriptions of how bitcoin proponents secured their bitcoins. Some of the ideas were a bit over the top like this one; Both stories are very similar to the tales told on Ripley’s Believe It Or Not producing some interesting conversations among bitcoin enthusiasts. Most people would agree that mortgaging your home because of bitcoin price speculation may not be the best idea. Furthermore, there are many shitty people in this world, and some of them may appear to be ‘friends’, but leaving your seed phrase out in the open is also a terrible security practice.

After breaching the $1800 range the digital currency’s value almost touched the $1900 mark, but settled in the lower $1800s a few hours later. The price held stable in this territory for a little less than 12 hours and started to see a bearish dip. At its lowest point, the price spiraled downwards losing 10 percent in value throughout May 12 as the currency’s fiat value came awfully close to entering the $1500 territory. Reaching a high of $1890 was sure to bring volatility and the following correction. Many traders this past Friday predicted the price to drop lower into the $1400-1300s. However, the downtrend has led to a slight comeback into the $1700 range, which is an excellent sign for global trading markets. The possibility of approaching new all-time highs is still probable in the near future with the way bitcoin’s price has been trending. Technical indicators are showing different stories once again as the Simple Moving Average (SMA) shows the price may continue its path on the upside. Meanwhile, the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic show buyers are getting tiresome. Most altcoin prices are presently lower than the weeks prior, as a majority of the top ten markets have declined a touch. Ethereum (ETH) holds a price of $89 per ETH with a $8.2 billion market cap. Ripple (XRP) is one token still climbing slowly in value as the price per XRP is $0.20 cents at the time of writing. Litecoin (LTC) fans never got the large pump they were expecting from Segwit integration as the price dipped from a high of $35 to a low of $27 per LTC coincidentally after the implementation. Other altcoins at the moment are all seeing lows with NEM ($0.12), Dash ($86), Ethereum Classic ($6), Monero ($28), Stellar ($0.03), and Augur ($16). Bitcoin dominance compared to the rest of these markets is currently 53 percent at press time. Bitcoin buying pressure is keeping the price above the $1700 range, and a bigger push could get the value back into the $1800s. Volume is a bit lower than the past two weeks with $700 million traded daily so exhausted traders are likely resting and watching on the sidelines. Many people agree the subsequent dip after closing in on $1900 wasn’t that bad as the price was destined for correction after moving so fast. At present, looking at technical indicators and trader sentiment another all-time high is attainable."

This summer Countr’s tablet based POS software will be integrated with Coinify’s digital currency platform allowing customers from 115 countries to pay with cryptocurrency. Also read: How Bitcoin is like a Psychedelic Drug The digital asset payment provider Coinify says the company’s latest partnership aims to bolster more bitcoin adoption. On June 1 the Coinify application which processes 14 individual cryptocurrencies will be applied to the Amsterdam-based Countr’s merchant services network. Countr’s network started in 2014 and now captures over 3,000 merchants across 115 countries.       “We are always happy to take the advantage of new payment technologies and help our merchants to improve their businesses,” explains John Staunton, Co-founder, and CEO of Countr POS. “Blockchain is expected to be one of the major payment trends in the upcoming years and we are excited to integrate it to our POS system.” Coinify calls itself a blockchain payment service provider (bPSP), and was founded in 2014 by Mark Højgaard, and Lasse Birk Olesen. The startup has made partnerships with digital currency businesses in the space as well as receiving a multi-million dollar capital injection from firms like Seed Capital Denmark, and SEB Venture Capital. Last November Coinify joined forces with the Luxembourg-based company Blockchain enabling UK residents the ability to purchase bitcoin within the Blockchain wallet interface. Morten Bebe, the Sales Manager at Coinify says its latest partnership with Countr expands the company’s services to a broader audience worldwide. “Coinify is on a mission to spread the use of digital currencies by offering everyone the opportunity to use alternative payments methods and accept blockchain currency payments,” Morten Bebe details. “With Countr POS we are succeeding in expanding blockchain payments in both online and offline environments.” Coinify says it will continue servicing customers across the European continent but also looks to expand into Asian and global markets in general. The partnership with Countr will help progress Coinify’s goals towards enabling online businesses, physical shops, and individuals from various countries the chance to utilize digital currency solutions this summer.

2017-05-12T22:00:44-04:00,South Korea to Lower Capital Requirements for Bitcoin Remittance Businesses,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korea-lower-capital-requirements-bitcoin-remittance-businesses/,"The South Korean government is working on lowering the equity capital requirement for fintech companies offering foreign exchange (FX) transfer services, including those using bitcoin for remittances. With the aim “to boost Bitcoin-mediated foreign currency transfer market,” the change will be effective on June 18, according to South Korea’s leading daily business newspaper. Also read: Why South Korean Bitcoin Adoption Could Outpace Most Other Countries This Year Maeil Business Newspaper’s English language website, Pulse News, reported this week that the South Korean Ministry of Strategy and Finance has decided to lower the equity capital requirement for fintech companies offering FX transfer services. Effective on July 18, the capital requirement will be reduced from 2 billion KRW to 1 billion KRW (approx. 900,000 USD, at press time). The current 2 billion won requirement is outlined in the revised Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, which the ministry detailed in February. The aim of this revised act is to provide standards for small companies offering cross-border remittance services. However, this bill has been heavily criticized because the 2 billion won equity criteria is considered too high for most small fintech firms. Since the law concerns foreign currency transfers, only bitcoin remittance service providers are affected, according to leading South Korean Bitcoin wallet provider and exchange Coinplug. These companies are included in the law because they accept Korean won and deliver funds in a foreign currency at the destination, the company told Bitcoin.com. Pulse News refers to this set up as “Bitcoin-mediated foreign currency transfer.” Coinplug also confirmed that Bitcoin remittance businesses currently have to qualify for the 2 billion KRW capital requirement, which is expected to be lowered to 1 billion KRW. However, this law “does not effect Coinplug,” the company claims, adding that “We meet the requirement.” Overall, the company believes that the lower equity capital requirement will likely attract more fintech and Bitcoin companies to the market. “The biggest advantage of Bitcoin-mediated foreign currency transfer is the cheaper and faster remittance,” Pulse News wrote. Currently, banks use the SWIFT network for FX transfers which takes two to three days and can cost up to 6 percent of total remittances, the publication conveyed. In addition, “Commercial banks have raked in some 500 billion won as fee income from foreign currency transfer services each year.” Bitcoin remittances, on the other hand, can be done on the same day for about 1 percent fee, Pulse News concluded. The Korean won is currently the fourth most traded bitcoin market. In an interview with Bitcoin.com in January, Korbit CEO Tony Lyu talked about the growing popularity of using Bitcoin for international remittances in South Korea. The CEO of the second-largest bitcoin exchange by volume in the country said: What do you think of South Korea the lowering capital requirement? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-05-12T01:00:21-04:00,Research Paper Suggests Bitcoin Volatility Will Match Fiat in Two Years,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-volatility-match-fiat-two-years/,"A recent research paper published this month analyzes whether or not bitcoin can be a viable alternative to fiat currencies. The report, authored by Vavrinec Cermak from Skidmore College, offers an empirical analysis of bitcoin’s volatility based on a GARCH model. Cermak details that if bitcoin’s trend of decreasing volatility continues it could be a functioning alternative to fiat in 2-3 years. Also read: Coincheck Launches Interest-Paying Bitcoin Accounts  When people discuss bitcoin, many people say that bitcoin is too volatile to be an alternative to government-issued fiat currencies. For instance, many central banking entities have written many research papers explaining that bitcoin’s volatility makes the cryptocurrency not fit to compete with fiat reserves. Just recently a board member of the German bank, Bundesbank, stated that bitcoin was too volatile and a risky investment. Cermak’s paper agrees with central bankers to a point, but also believes things could change in the next few years. “The volatility of bitcoin has been steadily decreasing throughout its lifetime,” explains Cermak’s paper. Cermak says in order to determine bitcoin’s viability against fiat, two schools of economics were taken into consideration — Austrian and Keynesian. The Skidmore College researcher also uses the GARCH model often used in economics and econometrics. GARCH models measure and characterize statistics by utilizing a series of time frames or an index of data. Cermak explains that the research model shows bitcoin’s “biggest obstacle in becoming a useful unit of account is its high volatility.” “These are clear indications that Bitcoin is not sufficient as a unit of account yet,” details Cermak. “However, that does not necessarily mean that it will never be. If Bitcoin’s volatility ever reaches the levels of other fiat currencies, it would be entirely possible for countries to use bitcoin as a unit of account.” The research paper states presently bitcoin acts as a scarce digital commodity with a finite supply. Nevertheless, users also utilize bitcoin as a payment system or digital form of currency, Cermak explains. Because bitcoin’s value is so volatile, this makes a lot of users and merchants resort to converting to fiat almost immediately to hedge against losses. However, Cermak’s research suggests that bitcoin could meet fiat volatility levels in 2-3 years when traded daily volumes are sufficient. Cermak’s report states; Another interesting study written by bitcoin proponent and data analyst Willy Woo has a very similar theory to Cermak’s research paper. Woo predicts bitcoin volatility will match fiat currencies by July of 2019. “What we are seeing is bitcoin’s peak volatility is reducing steadily and will enter the realms of fiat currency (below 5.5%) by around July 2019,” explains Woo in October of 2016. Cermak also details that another factor that is helping limit bitcoin volatility is due to bitcoin derivative exchanges, which allow users to hedge and short sell by utilizing future markets. Even though bitcoin’s price fluctuations are becoming more subtle, Cermak also says the absence of a central bank minimizing systematic risk, could make it so bitcoin never reaches fiat volatility levels. Although, if bitcoin does match the volatility criteria of stable fiat currencies in the next two years, Cermak details that small nation states could easily adopt the cryptocurrency for the country’s local tender. “If Bitcoin approaches the volatility levels of fiat currencies, it will satisfy the criteria of being a functioning currency and therefore, will be ready for mass adoption,” Cermak’s paper concludes.

Also read: Russia Considers Recognizing Bitcoin in 2018 to Fight Money Laundering Founded in 2008 and headquartered in St. Petersburg, Ulmart has over 450 infrastructure facilities including fulfillment centers and pick-up points. The Russian version of Amazon.com is present in more than 240 cities and towns across Russia. A study by Trackad shows that Ulmart is the largest online retailer in Russia with 20 million monthly visitors, 30,000 daily orders, and 12 million items of goods and services. Trackad is a data management company used by the top 100 e-commerce Russian websites. According to Ulmart’s announcement on Wednesday: In addition to items listed on its website, the company also has a marketplace with growing inventory. “By year-end, an additional one million items could be on offer from third-party sellers,” the announcement reads. Bitcoin payments will not be available for all products listed on the website and the company has not decided which products can be purchased with bitcoin. However, higher-priced items are likely to be targeted first, Ulmart revealed, adding that: Russia has a long history of changing its mind about the legality of Bitcoin. At times, it even considered an outright ban of the cryptocurrency, punishable by jail time for those holding bitcoins. In February 2014, Russia issued warnings against using bitcoin citing how it could be used for money laundering or financing terrorism. After several years without legal exchanges available to the Russian people, face-to-face bitcoin trading at markets like Localbitcoins have flourished, boosting Russia up among the largest bitcoin trading markets by volume. Then last month, Russia considered recognizing bitcoin as a legitimate financial instrument starting in 2018, in order to fight money laundering. The Chief International Officer of Ulmart, Brian Kean, said: “we welcome the willingness that the Russian government has demonstrated with regards to the review of the Bitcoin technology.” He looks forward to cooperating with the government in order to “play a major role” in making Bitcoin part of “the efforts to develop ‘smart’ economy and cities.” Dmitry Kostygin, the Chairman and majority shareholder of Ulmart said that the company started closely monitoring the market and regulatory environment for bitcoin use in Russia since March 2014.

Now that the inspections are near completion, regulators are reportedly preparing to issue regulatory guidelines for all bitcoin trading platforms in China. These documents are expected to be released in June and withdrawals could soon follow. Also read: ‘Rectification Plan’ for Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Leaked The on-site inspections of Chinese bitcoin exchanges are near completion, reports Caixin on Wednesday. The regulators will soon issue a “Notice of Administrative Punishment” to each of China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges, according to a translation by Cnledger on Twitter. “This type of notice is issued by government departments to those who did not break the laws but violated certain rules or regulations. In many cases, fines are incurred,” Cnledger explained. Okcoin, Huobi, and Btcc “will be facing a penalty of an unknown amount,” local Chinese publication 8Btc wrote. Last month, Bitcoin.com reported on a leaked document of the Chinese government’s “rectification plan” for bitcoin exchanges. 8Btc reported on Wednesday that rectification requirements and inspection findings were used to compile two regulatory documents. The “management guidelines” and “AML guidelines” for bitcoin exchanges are expected to be released in June, the publication detailed, adding that: The on-site inspections of Chinese bitcoin exchanges began in January. The following month, major Chinese exchanges announced the suspension of bitcoin withdrawals for one month, only to extend it longer. The exchanges have claimed the withdrawal suspensions are necessary while they develop and upgrade their systems to comply with regulations. They have also suspended margin trading. Following the inspections of major bitcoin exchanges, the PBOC started inspecting smaller ones. The bank also reportedly suggested extreme measures for all Chinese bitcoin exchanges to follow including in-person verification for account opening and other extensive customer verifications. Meanwhile, the bank has put together a list of rules for bitcoin exchanges to follow. Withdrawal suspensions and other major changes were speculated as being orders from the PBOC; a theory which was confirmed in the leaked document in April. In March, Bitcoin.com reported that Chinese bitcoin exchanges would not resume withdrawals until the AML rules have been clarified. Btcc, Huobi and Okcoin separately said at the time that: As the AML document and regulatory guidelines for Chinese bitcoin exchanges are expected to be released in June, “bitcoin withdrawal suspension could be removed subsequently,” 8Btc noted.

2017-05-10T19:00:01-04:00,Bitcoin Double Taxation Ends in Australia July 1st,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-double-taxation-ends-australia-july-1st/,"Bitcoin.com recently reported that Australia’s government was planning to end the double taxation of bitcoin and increase fintech research and development within the country. In a recent budget report published on May 10, Australian authorities have revealed they will end the double taxation of virtual currencies July 1st as leaders plan to position “Australia to be a world-leader in fintech.” Also read: Bitcoin Price Hits $1750 as Trade Volumes Continue to Soar Australia is looking to embrace financial technology and digital currencies according to the country’s 2017-2018 budget report. The report details that Australia is committed to becoming a global technology leader and the budget package aims to position the local industry. As far as bitcoin is concerned the government has decided to amend the country’s goods and services tax (GST) law to end digital currency double taxation. “The Government will make it easier for new innovative digital currency businesses to operate in Australia. From 1 July 2017, purchases of digital currency will no longer be subject to the GST, allowing digital currencies to be treated just like money for GST purposes,” explains the budget report. “Currently, consumers who use digital currencies can effectively bear GST twice: once on the purchase of the digital currency and once again on its use in exchange for other goods and services subject to the GST.” The Australian bitcoin community is sure to welcome the new changes after being subject to capital gains and fringe benefits tax since July of 2014. A year later in August of 2015, a Senate inquiry revealed leaders wanted to overturn the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) ruling and began working on amending the tax guidelines. At the time Senator Sam Dastyari believed the states and the Commonwealth should reconsider the ATO’s decision to classify digital currencies as “intangible assets” and treat bitcoin as a regular currency. Australia’s “Backing innovation and fintech” budget report also explains new businesses are encouraged to join a regulated fintech sandbox that can help early startup funding. Furthermore, the government has introduced new tax incentives for qualifying fintech start-ups and early stage innovation companies (ESIC). The report explains amending the digital currency taxation statutes will enhance innovation between consumers and Australian businesses. The 2017-2018 budget statutes also give a detailed explanation of how digital currency taxation will work after July 1. The report goes on to describe a person buying a video game with bitcoin and how taxation applies to that particular type of transaction. Under the new measure, the person’s original purchase of digital currency will no longer be subject to GST providing the same outcome if the individual used Australian dollars. Bitcoin has been steadily growing popular in Australia for quite some time. The country now has 13 bitcoin ATMs and a few exchanges and brokerage services like Coinjar, Bit Trade Australia, and Coin Loft. Alongside this, Localbitcoins volumes in Australia have been rising exponentially this year. The country also has an Australian Digital Currency Commerce Association (ADCCA) and many more cryptocurrency businesses and advocates within the region. The ADCCA also submitted a letter to the treasury in order to help bolster amending the GST law introduced in 2014. “The ADCCA urges the Australian Government to quickly move to make the amendments necessary,” the organization stated. With the new GST guidelines implemented July 1 leaders hope to encourage more digital currency and fintech growth within the country, according to the budget report.

In a May 5 news article, a board member of Bundesbank decried the use of bitcoin as risky and ill-advised.  Also read: Coincheck Launches Interest-Paying Bitcoin Accounts Pending Regulatory Approval The board member said, “From our point of view, bitcoin is not a suitable medium for storing values. This shows a simple view of the very fluctuating course development.” This comment is not surprising coming from the German banking gentry, as most Germans prefer cash over debit cards. A news article by Handelsblatt Global cited a recent survey, “In fact, Germans – and their German-speaking Austrian neighbors – are more likely to carry cash around than any other European country. They’re also less willing to imagine a day when they can get along without it, a new survey released Wednesday has found.” The Bundesbank board member was specifically concerned about the “volatile” nature of bitcoin, but his comment resonates with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. In reality, the volatility level of bitcoin has declined over the years. Justin Connell, writing for Bitcoin.com, stated in an article that bitcoin volatility has fallen since 2011. According to the charts, bitcoin has seen an ebb in volatility when compared to other currencies such as the Euro, Bristish Pound, and Japanese Yen. Connell said, Connell finished the article by saying bitcoin transactions have significantly increased throughout the currency’s lifespan, along with the price, yet volatility has not drastically surged. Even though German bankers erroneously take issue with bitcoin volatility, they are still not hurrying to ban it. They see it as a useful means to transfer money so long as people do not violate money laundering regulations. Currently, the banking board member views bitcoin as a niche product that does not threaten the global monetary system or German banking schemes. In other words, bankers give people permission to use bitcoin so long as laws are being followed and the digital currency does not threaten the status quo.  The news article said, “Users should not violate the rules on money laundering. Bitcoin also does not pose a threat to the financial system, at least as long as it remains a marginal phenomenon.” Do you think German bankers will ever have a change of heart?

2017-05-10T12:00:00-04:00,Bitcoin’s Price Rise Brings Mt Gox Closer to Solvency,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-price-rise-mt-gox-closer-solvency/,"Everyone involved in the cryptocurrency space is watching the price of bitcoin very closely these past few weeks. One person watching the value of bitcoin rise is the former CEO of the now-defunct Mt Gox bitcoin exchange. Mark Karpeles says he’s “monitoring the situation” as the Mt Gox bankruptcy may seemingly become solvent thanks to rising price of bitcoin. Also Read: Bitcoin Network Hashrate Surpasses Four Exahash Per Second Last week a post on the subreddit r/mtgoxinsolvency detailed that “Mt Gox reached around 78.5 percent of the claims value today.” The person also asked the former CEO what would happen if bitcoin’s price makes it to 100 percent of the claims value. Karpeles appeared on the Reddit thread detailing his interest concerning the current situation. The former Mt Gox executive says because Coinlab is suing the company it really makes the claims value around 59 percent. Coinlab, the venture-backed blockchain company, has sued Mt Gox for $75 million before the company went bankrupt.   “I am monitoring the situation,” explains Mark Karpeles. “We are still around 59.92% (74.29% if excluding CoinLab – but it can’t be excluded as the lawsuit is still in progress). Remember to use JPY values for calculation, since USD is bound to not be exact.” Following this statement, bitcoin developer Lukejr asks Karpeles if there is a “real possibility Mt Gox can exit bankruptcy if it reaches 100%?”   “Yep, but not to reopen as Mt Gox,” Karpeles replies. “The idea would be to establish some kind of trust to distribute BTC outside of the bankruptcy process, allowing for their easy distribution. The plan is to have recovered bitcoins distributed as is to BTC creditors, on the address they provided to receive the original payments.” Many people discussing the subject on the forum were quite pleased with hearing Karpeles responses to questions. People further asked what the possibility was of Mt Gox re-opening and offering creditors a chance to become company shareholders as well as possibly cover the cost of some of the missing bitcoins. “That is an alternative, but it would involve re-launching Mt Gox, which would probably not work for many reasons,” Karpeles explains. “Having a trust set up and distribution list kept for distribution of recovered assets is perfectly legal, has no running cost and be fair. Compliance cost in the US is way outside of Coinlab’s reach, and I’d be surprised to hear Coinlab was ever planning to be compliant. The discussion seemed very positive for those who lost funds during the bitcoin exchange’s hack in 2013 which was followed by bankruptcy. Karpeles then goes on to explain that most of the process cannot begin until the 100 percent threshold is met. In regards to the Coinlab lawsuit Karpeles says someone can order documentation from the court to help with the process, but he can’t afford to do that at the moment. In theory, anyone could do it, so if someone does I’ll be happy to host the files on dropbox or anything,” Karpeles adds.

The new service will offer zero trading fees and will be available from May 24. Also read: The Japanese are Using Bitcoin More than Expected The Japanese internet giant GMO Internet Group has officially announced that its subsidiary, GMO-Z.com Coin Co. Ltd, is launching a bitcoin trading platform on May 24. Formerly known as GMO Wallet Co. Ltd, GMO-Z.com Coin Co. Ltd was established in October 2016 to develop a digital currency exchange and trading business. The company started testing digital currency trading services in November 2016 and has been preparing for a full-scale operation ever since, according to Tuesday’s announcement. Starting on May 9, interested users can pre-register for an account on this new trading platform. The platform will be called “Z.com Coin”, according to the company’s announcement. Initially, it will facilitate the trading of two types of products: The first product type describes bitcoin margin trading, with leverage of up to 5 times. The second product type describes bitcoin trading in Japanese yen with the following fee structure: At launch, only bitcoin will be supported but the company plans to support other cryptocurrencies in the future, starting with Ethereum. Z.com Coin will also offer more functionalities such as charts and tools. Overall, the company plans to develop new digital currency services in cooperation with all companies within the GMO Internet Group. These services will be offered throughout the Asian region under the group’s global brand “Z.com”, the company details. Citing provisions for consumer protection established by the revised fund settlement law which took effect on April 1, GMO Internet Group outlines various measures the company has taken to comply with rules set forth by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA). “As a countermeasure against theft of virtual currencies, we have developed a management system and security system for customers’ assets, such as adopting cold storage and multi-signature,” the company wrote. Money received from customers is calculated and verified each business day, separate from the company’s own funds. In addition, customers’ private keys are stored separately, the company conveyed. “All assets deposited from customers are managed separately from the assets of GMO – Z.com Coin.” Do you think GMO’s bitcoin trading platform will do well?

The photo got circulated on Monday after Marcron defeated the right nationalist Marine Le Pen. The photo generated about 1500 up votes.   Also read: Bitcoin Network Hashrate Surpasses Four Exahash Per Second Even though the photo inspired many crypto-enthusiasts to become excited that France’s new president might be a tech geek, there is not much information about his stance on bitcoin or his level of expertise. According to various news sources, the photo was originally taken last March at the Cap Digital tech event…but this is nothing out of the ordinary. As part of his previous job as Minister of Finance, he constantly had to provide the pretense of appreciating technology, even if he knows little to nothing about it. There is one roughly translated quote from a french article that suggests he might possess some inkling of understanding. Macron said, “financial regulation to allow experimentation of blockchains dedicated to the market of Bonds…If the experimentation is conclusive, the government could extend it to unlisted securities in order to promote the emergence of a SME exchange.” Regardless if the quote says anything about his knowledge of cryptocurrencies, trusting politicians to do the right thing with technology is always a contentious topic. politicians mainly focus on regulating industries and writing laws. This is especially true since Macron generally supports left-leaning ideologies, which are notoriously hostile to any type of money. Macron even supports the EU and policies that work to create communal environments, which do not usually resonate with the spirit of bitcoin or any money. One Steemit article said, Therefore, the idea that Macron may appreciate cryptocurrency and cryptography is likely not within the realm of possibility. On the other side of the coin, times are changing and even politicians are starting to be humbled by the sheer power of blockchain technology.

However, the service is currently restricted, pending the approval of the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA). Also read: The Japanese are Using Bitcoin More than Expected On Monday, Coincheck co-founder and COO Yusuke Otsuka tweeted announcing the company’s new service that allows customers to earn up to 5 percent annual interest by depositing their bitcoin at the exchange. The news was also reported by the national newspaper Nikkei. On Coincheck’s website, the company calls this service “Coincheck Lending”. The exchange wrote: “Do you have spare bitcoin that is not used? Open Coincheck Lending account, and deposit your bitcoin. You can earn interest rate (Maximum 5%).” There are four plans: “An account holder depositing 10 bitcoin ($15,956) for 90 days would earn roughly 0.07 bitcoin,” wrote Nikkei. “All Coincheck users who have completed sign-up processes are eligible,” the company wrote, adding that currently only bitcoin will be offered. However, there are plans to add other cryptocurrencies in the near future, including Ethereum, Ripple, Monero, Factom, and Augur. Users wanting to participate in this offering “must agree with the consumption loan agreement, which is an unsecured contract,” advises the exchange, adding that “users have a risk of not being able to receive deposited cryptocurrencies back in a case Coincheck is bankrupt.” In addition, deposited cryptocurrencies are not managed as segregated funds. The exchange details: Nikkei wrote that the Japanese FSA says “Coincheck’s deposit service is exempt from banking regulations and recent revisions to fund settlement law, as bitcoin is not legal tender.” However, this may not be the case since Coincheck told Bitcoin.com that the service is currently restricted and pending FSA approval. Bitcoin is recently recognized in Japan as a method of payment similar to prepaid cards and gift certificates. “Hundreds of thousands of Japanese are said to have some bitcoin to their names, but many apparently let the currency gather digital dust. The ability to earn interest on their holdings may prove attractive,” wrote Nikkei. What do you think of Coincheck’s new interest-paying account service? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-05-09T13:00:44-04:00,Bitcoin Price Hits $1750 as Trade Volumes Continue to Soar,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-1750-trade-volumes-soar/,"Bitcoiners woke up to a pleasant surprise on Tuesday, May 9 as the price per bitcoin once again touches new levels. The decentralized currency continues to trade higher as bitcoin’s fiat value is currently up over 15 percent with an average price of US$1720 per BTC. Also read: Virtual Currencies Now Permissible Investments in Vermont Just when traders thought the rally was getting exhausted, bitcoin’s price pushed up once again after remaining stable in the $1520-40 range for roughly 72 hours earlier this week. During the early hours of May 8 coincidently after the French election, bitcoin’s price shot up above the $1600 range and continued to climb all day. Now bitcoin has hit another all-time high touching $1750 per BTC at 8 am EST.  After last week’s breakout to a high of $1620 on Bitstamp, bitcoin’s value subsequently dropped one hour later to a low of $1445. Following the dip, the price consolidated above the $1500 mark as buyers stepped off to the sidelines. The bull market is now charging full steam ahead as it seems buyers are playing their cards again hoping for winning hands and bigger gains. Along the way, the price has been shaky bouncing 20-40 in price at any given time giving plenty of room for intra-range strategy. Technical indicators show after bitcoin’s consolidation pattern buyers have regained confidence and stepped back into the trading atmosphere. Trading has been incredibly bullish as 24-hour bitcoin trade volume has been showing $1 billion USD worth of trades per day. There seems to be very little resistance on the upside until the $1750-1775 range where there are giant sell walls across order books. The 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still well above the long-term 200 SMA indicating the upside motion should continue. Stochastic and Relative Strength Index (RSI) indicators are at odds with each other at the moment, as the first indicator shows overbought territory, while the RSI shows more bullish sentiment. Meanwhile, most traders are concentrating on Fibonacci ratio data as bitcoin’s price trajectory is well above what technical indicators in the past few weeks expected.  As far as the top ten cryptocurrency market caps below bitcoin, most all of them have seen price dips over the previous 12 hours. Ethereum (ETH) prices have dropped to a low of $88 per ETH, but still holds $8 billion in market capitalization. Ripple (XRP) has seen an enormous jump over the past 48 hours as the price hit an all-time high of $0.23 cents per XRP. The Ripple market had also temporarily eclipsed the Ethereum market for a short period taking the number two position. However, Ripple’s prices have since dipped to a low of $0.17 cents per token. The rest of the coins in the top ten are seeing price declines between 5-30 percent over the past 24 hours. Litecoin (LTC) is $27, NEM $0.11, Dash $90, Ethereum Classic (ETC) $6, Monero (XMR) $28, Stellar (XLM) $0.02, and Steem is back at $0.80 per token. Overall bitcoin’s price trajectory seems to be moon-bound as many hope it could rise into the $2000 range this year. Bitcoin proponents are watching developments in Japan closely as the country now captures a considerable portion of bitcoin trade volume worldwide. Meanwhile, mainstream investors and well-known news outlets are highlighting bitcoin’s price performance regularly. No one knows what’s next but bitcoiners are undoubtedly celebrating the ‘Bitcoin Spring’ as the significant price rise in May is definitely a milestone for the digital currency’s history books. Bear Scenario: At the moment if a big sell off occurs books show strong support in the $1625-1650 range. The price of bitcoin has been volatile, and there will be a slew of shakeouts with the price being so high. Technical indicators have been helpful for some short-term predictions, but long term predictions paired with past results have been fallible. Bull Market: Bitcoin’s price could break above the $1800 mark in the short term, but there is significant resistance in the $1750-1775 region. Similarly, long term predictions at the current rate have been futile, and the only consistent indicator lately is the Fibonacci. Analysts, speculators and other traders do believe bitcoin’s price trajectory could top $2000, but anything could happen in the meantime depending on news and exchange liquidity.

2017-05-09T03:00:44-04:00,Australian Bitcoin Bill Pay Service Processes $4 Million in 16 Months,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/australian-bitcoin-bill-pay-service-processes-4-million-in-16-months/,"Australian Bitcoin bill payment service Living Room of Satoshi announced on Monday that it has processed over 5 million Australian dollars worth of household bills. Bitcoin.com talked to co-founder and CTO Daniel Alexiuc to learn more about how this milestone was reached and the company’s future plans. He revealed that $4 million worth of bills were paid in bitcoin in the last 16 months alone. Also read: The Japanese are Using Bitcoin More than Expected Launched in May 2014, the Brisbane-based company Living Room of Satoshi enables online bill payments and bank transfers using bitcoin and five other cryptocurrencies. Any bills with the BPAY logo and Biller Code can be paid. “More than 19,000 businesses accept payments using BPAY,” the company states. The service makes money from currency spreads so it does not charge any fees. Three months after launching, the company had paid $150,000 AUD worth of Australian household bills with bitcoin. Alexiuc told Bitcoin.com: Overall, it only took the company 16 months to grow from $1 million worth of bills paid to $5 million. While the company allows bill payments using five other cryptocurrencies, the $5 million was in bitcoin only with other cryptocurrencies accounting for only $250,000 of bills paid, Alexiuc clarified. Living Room of Satoshi (LRS): I think it’s basically organic growth that is reflecting the increased Bitcoin usage and adoption overall. When I started Living Room of Satoshi, there was very little you could do with Bitcoin. But now in addition to our bill payment service, there are multiple exchanges, wage conversion services and a whole host of retail options for Bitcoin usage. LRS: We have more than 1,100 registered users, and many more who use Living Room of Satoshi casually to pay bills without signing up. The majority are in Australia, but we see lots of customers using the service from overseas – for example, one father in Germany is helping out with his daughter’s bills while she is studying in Australia. LRS: We’re averaging around $100,000 per week at the moment (the last 10 weeks). This is an increase from about $60,000 per week for the previous 10 weeks. LRS: $590 LRS: It’s a little difficult to break it down, many bills are paid using bank transfer in Australia too, and we don’t record personal vs bill use in this case. But the raw data is this: 47% BPAY and 53% Bank transfer. LRS: Yes, the biggest of these is the “Double GST” charged on Bitcoin purchases, which makes it very difficult for Bitcoin to gain adoption with business in Australia. Our Treasurer Scott Morrison announced that this “Double GST” on Bitcoin would be abolished almost one year ago, and recently reaffirmed his commitment to this. But the government cannot seem to keep pace with the innovation happening in the crypto space for Australian business, and nothing has changed yet. LRS: The regulations and reasons are long, involved and boring, but that’s what currently applies to our service. We certainly have demand for larger bills to be paid. My own electricity bill is more than $1000 now! At the moment, it needs to be split up over 2 payments but we are planning to meet the additional regulatory requirements to be able to lift this limit in the future. LRS: Expanding internationally, into New Zealand first. We Aussies have a close affinity with our neighbours “across the ditch”. LRS: Yes, we get a lot of requests from people in many countries who want us to come there. Regulatory requirements are the most difficult hurdle to overcome, followed by maintaining stable banking relationships. LRS: BPAY has a quasi-monopoly on bill payments in Australia, being a company that is jointly owned by Australia’s big 4 banks. This makes it extremely difficult for competition in the space. The vast majority of bills are paid in Australia using BPAY or Bank transfer, so we have covered both of those. But we are hoping that, eventually, we will be able to convince billers to start accepting payment directly in Bitcoin, and then customers can bypass Living Room of Satoshi completely! LRS: Adoption is accelerating, we hope to hit $10 million before the end of the year. Would you use Living Room of Satoshi to pay your bills if available in your area?

2017-05-08T19:00:52-04:00,Bitcoin Network Hashrate Surpasses Four Exahash Per Second,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hashrate-four-exahash-per-second/,"The Bitcoin ecosystem is thriving as the decentralized network continues to break new records in 2017. This month the Bitcoin network’s hashrate surpassed over four exahash per second adding one more milestone to the record books. Also Read: Bitcoin Startups Believe Africa Is Fertile Ground for Crypto-Solutions The bitcoin mining environment has grown massive with many participants and pools competing to process transactions so they can earn fresh new bitcoins. The mining process has evolved from individuals mining on their computers at home to mega-sized data facilities located all around the world filled with thousands of machines. Over the past year and four months, bitcoin’s hashrate has entered the exahash era as the network processed one exahash per second in January of 2016. Now the miners’ collective hashrate is over four exahash per second or 4,216,797,036 GH/s, surpassing the most powerful supercomputers in the world. An exahash solves 10^18 hashes (problem-solving with algorithms) per second which means the network’s hashrate is processing beyond exascale computing speeds at over four quintillion hashes per second. According to research, exascale computing technology will grow exponentially in 2018, and the bitcoin network became one of those technologies when it surpassed 1.5 exahashes per second in mid-2016. The introduction of new mining chips and the growth of mining pools has led many people to believe bitcoin is the most secure computational network in history.  Bitcoin’s rise in fiat value has helped push mining to new levels over the past year. According to statistics mining revenue is up more so than ever before as miners accumulate coinbase rewards and mining fees. However, network difficulty is also extremely high making it difficult for solo miners to make a profit without joining a pool. Bitcoin’s network difficulty is a measurement of how difficult it is for miners to find a hash below the given target.  Mining pools have been around for quite some time, and a few years ago people thought hashrate distribution was too concentrated between a few pools. In particular, during the summer of 2014, Ghash mining pool breached the 51 percent threshold of hashrate distribution several times. However, in 2017 there are more pools than ever as there are currently roughly 22 pools commanding most of the mining power. No pool has more than 20 percent of the hashrate distribution, and there are only six significantly larger pools compared to all the others. Looking at Bitcoin’s hashrate compared to other altcoins using proof-of-work one can see that Bitcoin’s processing power is exponentially larger. For instance, the Litecoin network’s hashrate is 5,695 GH/s, Ethereum’s is 23766 GH/s and the hashrate for the Dash network is 1,252 GH/s. The processing power of the Bitcoin network is leaps and bounds larger than all three of these alternative networks combined. Making Bitcoin’s distributed ledger not only the longest running, but also considered by many as the most secure blockchain on the face of the earth.

2017-05-08T13:30:39-04:00,The Cryptocurrency Race Heats up as Bitcoin Dominance Drops 30%,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/cryptocurrency-race-bitcoin-dominance-drops-30/,"Bitcoin’s price has been rising steadily throughout 2016 and Q1 of 2017 amassing a record market capitalization of $25.5 billion USD. However, many other cryptocurrency markets are growing in value and bitcoin has lost more than 30 percent of its market share over the past four months. Also read: Why Serious Investors Need Bitcoin in Their Portfolios For a very long time, bitcoin’s market capitalization (market cap) was considerably larger than all the other altcoins in existence. A market cap is the total market value of all bitcoins across all major exchanges at a specific point in time. Capitalization analysis is often used as a statistic that roughly shows a particular markets net worth. Since bitcoin’s initial value began and other altcoin price indexes emerged, bitcoin commanded 80-90 percent of market cap dominance. Now bitcoin dominance compared to other altcoin market shares has dropped to an all-time low of 53 percent. During the first month of 2017 bitcoin dominance was roughly 87 percent and subsequently began to decline during the following months. Alternative cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Dash, Litecoin, Ripple, Monero, and others have all seen significant price spikes over the past four months. For instance, in January one ether (ETH) was worth $8 per token, and the currency had a market cap of $722 million. Now one ETH is roughly $96, and Ethereum is holding a $8.8 billion dollar market capitalization. Increases like this have been seen with numerous altcoins, and right now four cryptocurrency markets now capture over a billion in fiat value or more. Even though there’s been a decline, some people believe market capitalization isn’t the best method of measuring bitcoin’s value. Civic founder and entrepreneur Vinny Lingham has written a detailed article concerning this subject and believes market caps were designed for stocks and are not constructive for bitcoin’s real valuation. In a post written last spring called “Deconstructing the Bitcoin Market Cap” Lingham states; There are many others who believe bitcoin’s market cap and share of dominance among other cryptocurrencies should also be taken lightly. Skeptics say that most of the altcoins pumping in value are really only traded on exchanges being pumped one day and dumped a few days or weeks later. People who hold this view believe most altcoins are merely speculative tokens for trading purposes only and have yet to show any real world use. For instance, as far as real use is concerned, the company Bitwala has stated just recently that not many people are actually using altcoins with their platform. Another example of altcoins lacking real world usage comes from the company the Living Room of Satoshi’s statistics, a startup that allows people to pay bills with cryptocurrencies. According to the company’s charts, right now bitcoin is being used by customers paying bills 88 percent of the time while other altcoins are five percent or less. Nevertheless, people are still concerned about bitcoin’s market dominance among competitors who are growing in value fast. Even the Economist and Editor in Chief at Adamant Research, Tuur Demeester, recently said he was “losing sleep over Ethereum.” “With the recent surge in the Ethereum price (ETH reaching 30% of Bitcoin’s market cap at nearly $5 billion), I find myself reassessing a number of my conclusions,” explains Demeester’s April blog post. Bitcoin’s market dominance of 53 percent is also being discussed heavily across forums and social media. Furthermore, some altcoin communities are placing the blame on bitcoin’s inability to scale and are using the scaling debate to bash the original cryptocurrency negatively. Speculators are comparing bitcoin to ideas that have fallen by the wayside due to better competitors, like Facebook and Myspace, Cassettes to MP3, and VHS to DVD. Mainstream news outlets like the Economist, Bloomberg, Reuters, and others have made similar statements that bitcoin will lose out to competitors. Bitcoin is still doing exceptionally well during the first four months of 2017, and its value in terms of fiat is higher than ever before. It is still one of the best performing currencies worldwide and continues to make government issued tender look pitiful. It is still the most accepted cryptocurrency, processes more daily transactions, has the biggest hashrate crossing 4,064,444,090 GH/s, and many more achievements well above any other altcoin. So while bitcoin dominance may be low for now, there are a vast amount of other statistics that outshine alternatives.

2017-05-08T06:00:43-04:00,The Japanese are Using Bitcoin More than Expected,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-japanese-using-bitcoin-expected/,"Since Japan started recognizing bitcoin as a method of payment, more Japanese are using the digital currency than expected. Bitcoin.com discussed this trend with Yuzo Kano, CEO of Bitflyer, the largest bitcoin exchange in Japan by volume. Also read: Media Frenzy in Japan as Bic Camera Starts Accepting Bitcoin On April 1, Japan started recognizing bitcoin as a method of payment, similar to prepaid cards and gift certificates. Since then, Bitcoin usage and awareness in Japan have been growing. Among retailers that started accepting bitcoin in April were two Bic Camera stores. The Japanese consumer electronics giant partnered with Bitflyer to accept the digital currency. The news was heavily reported by mainstream media in Japan. Kano told Bitcoin.com: Interest in Bitcoin has spiked among merchants in Japan and many other retail stores are considering accepting the digital currency. “We are expecting that some large retail shops and e-commerce sites will introduce bitcoin payment within this year,” Kano conveyed, adding that “more and more to come in the next year.” So far, he said: Last week, Japanese national newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun, which claims to have the largest circulation in the world, wrote that Bitcoin is “increasingly being used in Japan.” For example, the publication reported that a popular conveyor belt sushi restaurant in Tokyo called Sushi-Bar Numazuko Ginza 1st is seeing a spike in bitcoin usage. While bitcoin was used only a few times a month two years ago at the restaurant, about 70 payments were made with bitcoin in March. The restaurant also has a Bitcoin ATM inside. The fee for buying bitcoin there is 11.9 percent with the daily limit of ¥100000, according to Bitcoin ATM tracking website, Coinatmradar. The restaurant manager told Yomiuri Shimbun: Kano echoed the sentiment, telling Bitcoin.com that: “At the moment, we’ve heard that mainly Japanese users use Bitcoin payment. There are not many foreigners or tourists using Bitcoin payment.” Males between 20s and 40s show the strongest growth in Bitcoin usage, the CEO revealed. Bitflyer is also seeing a significant growth in its user base. “The number of customers has been growing rapidly since April 1,” he said, adding that currently “the number of our users is almost 600k.” There is also the added advantage of not having to pay foreign exchange (FX) fees when using bitcoin compared to when exchanging foreign currencies into yen. According to Yomiuri Shimbun: In addition, the government has announced that, starting in July, purchasing bitcoins in Japan will no longer be levied consumption tax of 8 percent.

This week the Hong Kong-based Bitspark has launched a remittance service to Nigeria at rates 14.4 percent better than competitors, by leveraging the speed and efficiency of the Bitcoin network. Also Read: U.S. Government Cracks Down on Illegal Bitcoin Money Transmitters The startup Bitspark is a cryptocurrency-financial services provider servicing the Asia-Pacific region and now countries located in Africa. The company has created an end to end remittance service powered by the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitspark says they will focus on Nigeria first as the country has the largest population and economy within the African continent. According to statistics, Nigeria has received an annual US$21 billion in remittances from countries across the globe.  Bitspark details that its newly launched Nigerian payment service will save people transaction costs as the company believes it is far cheaper than remittance competitors. “For every one dollar you send to Nigeria you’ll receive $0.14 more than if you use a competitor’s offer which at the end of the day can work out to be hundreds of dollars to the average transaction,” explains Bitspark. South African countries are embracing bitcoin as Google Trends points out significant interest is arising from Nigeria and Ghana. Furthermore, according to a research report from the wallet provider Luno, concerning South Africa, bitcoin is attractive to citizens within the country. Luno’s report also details that 66 percent of South Africans surveyed say they trust bitcoin. 12.9 percent of responses say South Africans are using it for faster payments but 39.6 percent of those surveyed are holding bitcoins as an investment vehicle. Just recently the payment platform startup Bitwala announced a new service offering bitcoin-to-M-Pesa transactions at zero cost. Bitwala customers will be able to utilize the service to send funds to friends and family members in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania free of charge. Other companies focused on bitcoin remittance applications in Africa are also making headway in the region. Last month the African payment services provider Bitpesa partnered with the bitcoin-based lending platform Bitbond. In order to make cross-border lending possible both companies utilize the bitcoin blockchain for faster, more efficient payment processing. “This means that a small business owner from Kenya can receive loan funding from investors from all over the world via Bitbond and have the funds paid out to his mobile money account in 20 minutes,” explains the founder of Bitbond Radoslav Albrecht. “This is an unprecedented level of innovation and convenience in the entire online lending space.” Bitcoin-centric businesses are focusing in on Africa, and the South African region as cryptocurrency interest is growing fast.

With new money flowing in it seems mainstream investors are catching wind of bitcoin’s benefits. Bitcoin is considered a safe haven from worldwide economies that are failing, as well as an asset class that is outperforming many traditional investments found today. Also read: Australia’s Law to End Double Taxation of Bitcoin Stalled    This past February Bitcoin.com reported on how mainstream investors heard an awful lot about bitcoin’s performance as the asset grew considerably in value throughout 2016-2017. The price of bitcoin is still rising, and conventional investors continue to hear more and more about bitcoin’s market accomplishments. For instance, as the price grows higher, it has created a media frenzy of mainstream news outlets reporting on the price increase regularly these days. This has created a snowball effect where conventional and institutional investors begin rallying behind bitcoin as a new asset class because they hear about how good it’s doing. Just recently the first investor of Snapchat, Jeremy Liew said bitcoin is undervalued in a recent Business Insider presentation. During the presentation, Liew gave some fundamental reasons to why he thinks bitcoin will be worth $500,000 by 2030. Liew based his theory on factors like the rise of global remittances, economic uncertainty, and mobile penetration. “Bitcoin is already simple to buy and hold, and as the asset continues to mature, we’ll continue to see an increase in the development and deployment of surrounding products,” Liew explains. On May 4 Facebook investor and owner of the NBA team the Golden State Warriors, Chamath Palihapitiya, told his 67,000 Twitter followers that bitcoin is a defense against value destruction. Palihapitiya has been an advocate of bitcoin for quite some time and penned an article on how innovative bitcoin was for Bloomberg in 2013.    “I’ve told my friends that it is entirely rational to allocate one percent of your assets to Bitcoin — as I have,” explained Palihapitiya at the time. “Call it schmuck insurance. As the 2008 crisis proved, schmucks can cause a world of damage.” Last week the venture capitalist investor told his Twitter followers; There is no doubt that investors are seeing the price headlines in Time Magazine, Bloomberg, and the New York Times. Alongside the positive statements from successful entrepreneurs like Liew, and Palihapitiya, mainstream investors are sure to hear about bitcoin in some form or another.  There’s no doubt there is fresh money coming into bitcoin and cryptocurrencies markets in general. Investors cannot ignore an asset that has grown into a substantial market worth over $25 billion while traditional markets flounder. Furthermore, those who invested in bitcoin early like Palihapitiya know the concept of cryptocurrency is on a path to disrupt financial incumbents.               “It will reallocate financial strength and power to the people versus keeping it within a few centralized authorities,” Palihapitiya concludes in his editorial.

2017-05-07T12:00:01-04:00,CME Files Patent for ‘Physically Settled’ Bitcoin Derivatives Clearing System,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/cme-patent-physically-settled-bitcoin-derivatives-clearing-system/,"The U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) published last week a Bitcoin-related patent application by the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Inc (CME). It describes clearing systems for “physically settled” digital currency derivatives contracts, including bitcoin. Also read: Bitcoin Investment Trust Raises Offering to $1 Billion, Signs on Credit Suisse and Wedbush CME is an American financial and commodity derivative exchange based in Chicago. Today, it is the world’s largest options and futures contracts exchange, based on the number of contracts outstanding. The company filed a patent application titled “System for Physically Delivering Virtual Currencies” with the USPTO on November 4, 2015. It was then published on the agency’s website on May 4. The inventors listed on this patent application are Ryan Pierce, Sandra Ro, and Mansoor Ahmed. According to CME: The aforementioned derivative contracts include common futures and options contracts, CME details. In addition, the company specifies that “the virtual currency comprises bitcoin” without naming other cryptocurrencies. Last month, the USPTO published another Bitcoin-related patent application by the company. The patent for “Derivative Contracts that Settle Based on a Virtual Currency Difficulty Factor or an Index of Virtual Currency Generation Yield” was filed in October 2015 but published in April this year. In its patent filing, CME claims the needs for new systems and methods for transactions involving digital currencies including bitcoin, citing that these assets “can be transferred pseudonymously”. “Some types of futures contracts are ‘physically’ settled” where the actual commodity is delivered by the relevant counter-party at final settlement, the company explains, adding that: However, digital currency transactions “cannot be reversed without the consent of the recipient,” CME wrote, noting that “computer security breaches or employee dishonesty” could result in permanent loss of these assets. Furthermore, holding them “for settlement of derivatives contracts at a clearing counter-party presents a tempting target for thieves” and storing them also carries unique risks requiring specialized security procedures. The company believes: After outlining many risk factors, CME asserts that “there is a need in the art for improved systems and methods for clearing derivative contracts based on virtual currencies while minimizing risks to clearing counter-parties.” The patent describes “systems and methods that allow a clearing counter party to confirm that virtual currency has been physically delivered without taking possession of the virtual currency,” the company details.

With the French presidential election approaching, talks of Frexit have intensified and some believe that France leaving the EU could boost the price of bitcoin to “beyond record levels”. Also read: Bitcoin Investment Trust Raises Offering to $1 Billion, Signs on Credit Suisse and Wedbush Frexit has been proposed by a number of French politicians during the 2017 presidential elections, including presidential candidate Marine Le Pen. She said: On Sunday, May 7, the French people will cast their final vote in the country’s presidential election. Two candidates remain out of 11 from the first round; Le Pen and Emmanuel Macron. The far-right Le Pen is in favor of Frexit. She wants to replace the euro with a basket of new national currencies, and even considers capital controls. Her opponent, Macron, is a centrist who is in favor reforming the EU to avoid Frexit. Le Pen has reportedly spoken against Bitcoin to the point of suggesting banning the cryptocurrency. Macron, however, supports experimentation and the use of blockchain technology. The effect of Frexit on Bitcoin could bear a resemblance to how Brexit affects the digital currency after Britain voted to leave the EU in June last year. “Brexit offers an opportunity for the UK to become a hub for cryptocurrencies if it tries to reposition itself as an innovation economy,” Bob Swarup, a principal at Camdor Global Advisors, told The Telegraph. With the upcoming election, France’s future looks uncertain, similar to Brexit and Trump’s victory in the U.S., according to European Bitcoin startup Bitwala. “If the situation feels a little bit like a deja vu, this is because it is.” The startup noted that “the price of bitcoin experienced a 25% hike from the day before Brexit to the next,” adding that: Operating in over 120 countries with over 20 currencies, Bitwala claims to have over 25,000 users. The company offers remittance services using Bitcoin. “Hundreds of thousands of workers and immigrants currently residing in France are sending billions across borders to support their families with remittances,” the startup detailed. “Percentage of deposits and money transfer fees could eat directly into the savings of many affected families.” Bitcoin “could play a vital role upon the possible withdrawal of France’s withdrawal from the European Union and the reintroduction of the Franc,” Bitwala believes, adding that: Do you think Frexit will happen and how will it affect the price of bitcoin?

The only remaining step in the process is for Florida’s governor to sign it into law, in which case it will go into full effect.  Also read: Australia’s Government Renews Efforts to End Double Taxation of Bitcoin The intent of the bill is to prevent money-launderers from using bitcoin to hide funds generated from illicit activities. Florida legislators believe money launderers and other cyber criminals have been taking advantage of antiquated laws. They wanted to update them in the hopes of thwarting and undermining online financial crimes. In this regard, they have decided to call bitcoin a “monetary instrument.” The Miami Herald article quoted one of the law makers, Jamie Redman, writing for bitcoin.com, covered the reasons why Florida lawmakers have come down so hard on bitcoin’s alleged use in cyber crimes. Last year a “money laundering” case was dismissed by a judge, because bitcoin was defined as property rather than money. The case involved a man named Michel Espinoza who sold $1,500 worth of Bitcoin to an undercover cop. Redman said, “Espinoza’s case was dismissed because the judge considered bitcoins as a form of property. Miami-Dade officials are not pleased with the result of the Espinoza trial, and the state is appealing the judge’s decision.” The overarching theme across the United States with bitcoin is legislators do not know how to properly define it. They cannot decide whether to call it a money or commodity. This misunderstanding has led to a situation where people have been able to successfully use bitcoin to “launder money.” The IRS has officially said that bitcoin is property or a commodity. Will Florida politicians effectively stamp out crypto-based money laundering? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-05-06T14:00:33-04:00,The Bitcoin Network’s Transaction Queue Breaks Another Record,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-transaction-queue-breaks-record/,"Not only is the bitcoin price breaking records but the network transaction queue (mempool) has also hit an all-time high on May 5. Around 6 pm EST, the network had about 155,000 unconfirmed transactions with over 85 BTC worth of fees waiting to be settled. Related: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Are Up More Than 1200% in Past Two Years The last time the Bitcoin network’s mempool filled up and broke records was on February 22 with over 100,000 unconfirmed transactions. The record was surpassed on Friday, May 5 as the transaction backlog amassed over 150,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed according to Blockchain.info, Statoshi.info, and Tradeblock statistics. Of course, the subject of the massive backlog waiting in the transaction queue was heavily discussed on forums and social media. There also was numerous complaints of people waiting long periods of time to get a transaction confirmed. One bitcoin user writes; Meanwhile, some speculate the network was suffering a spam attack while others assumed the backlog is connected to the recent price spike because people are transacting more. A spam attack is when an exponentially high amount of very small transactions is being sent across the network with minuscule fees or have larger inputs/bytes per tx. Alongside the significant mempool size, average fees have been on the rise as well. People have been paying fees of $1-1.50 per transaction using wallets that figure for dynamic fees. According to 21 Inc’s fee calculator, the fastest and cheapest transaction fee is currently 280 satoshis/byte. Moreover, for the median transaction size of 226 bytes, fees are averaging 63,280 satoshis per transaction or $0.98 at the time of writing. Lately, there’s a lot of people using bitcoin, and over the past thirty days, the mempool’s transaction count has been spiking. Bitcoin trading volume has also been high over the past month and just recently reached $1 billion worth of trades in 24-hours. Transactions per day have been roughly 250,000-300,000 with the network working at full capacity during the jumps in price.  It’s safe to say that bitcoin is breaking a whole lot of records in 2017. However, some of the protocol’s lifetime achievements can be viewed as positive while some of the records are negatives. May 5th’s unconfirmed transaction count is just another record broken in bitcoin’s history to add to the list.   Records Broken   What do you think about bitcoin’s network backlog on May 5?

Bitcoins Bootcamp is a two-day event aimed at teaching attendees how to use bitcoin, a wallet, trade with the virtual currency, and learn all the basics.  Also read: How to Disrupt Everything: the Largest Blockchain Conference Coming to Amsterdam The Bitcoins Bootcamp conference is aimed at giving attendees total immersion into the world of bitcoin. The event is sponsored by cryptocurrency industry leaders such as Investopi, the regional bitcoin exchange Surbtc, Tropay, Wagecan, the Crypt-store, and Bitcoin.com.  “In Bootcamp, you will not only learn what bitcoins are, but you can also create your own wallet, learn mining, trading, crowdlending and start using your bitcoins in the day to day,” explains Bitcoins Bootcamp organizers. “You will have a total immersion into the world of bitcoins hand in hand with the best experts in the region.” Attendees of Bitcoins Bootcamp will not only learn to about the decentralized currency but also hear from regional industry experts who operate virtual currency businesses in the area. This includes Juliana Matiz (Investopi), Alejandro Beltran (Surbtc), Erick Ospina (Tropay), Arley Lozano (Panda Server) and many more. Bitcoin.com spoke with Arley Lozano, CEO, and founder of Panda Server about the Bitcoins Bootcamp event. Lozano says participants starting to learn about bitcoin are going from “zero to hero” during the two-day event. Currently, Lozano says there are roughly 240 participants at Bitcoins Bootcamp both attending virtually and in the flesh in the audience.  Organizers of the bitcoin training conference say the event is not a traditional webinar by any means. People participating are using computers, learning to mine, trade, and utilize bitcoins for daily activities like shopping. Lozano tells Bitcoin.com that attendees are also learning about how to avoid Ponzi schemes. Attendees also receive US$30 in BTC to open a wallet and learn to trade. Bitcoins Bootcamp organizers detail that participants will become very knowledgeable about cryptocurrencies after finishing the conference. Panda Server’s founder says he’s thrilled to attend the event and be immersed in such a learning atmosphere. “The event at this moment is so great,” Lozano details to Bitcoin.com. “People have a chance to talk with each speaker when they are finished speaking. From my point of view, the event is really good for newbies as they are learning each step of using the virtual currency and what is bitcoin. What events will you be attending this year?

It has been over a year since Treasurer Scott Morrison made the promise to act quickly on changing the country’s goods and services tax (GST) law. Also read: Australia’s Law to End Double Taxation of Bitcoin Stalled Bitcoin.com recently reported that the Australian government’s efforts to change the GST law to end the double taxation of bitcoin were stalled. While this issue was a priority last year, according to the Australian fintech industry, it has not been one this year. However, that may be changing based on a report released on Thursday by the Australian Minister for Small Business, Michael Mccormack MP. The 37-page report outlines the Government’s response to the “Inquiry into Business Set-up, Transfer and Closure” launched by the Productivity Commission. The role of this government’s independent research and advisory body is to help governments make better policies for the Australian community. The report reads: Areas such as taxation, including the GST tax, “is a major concern” for businesses, the report notes, adding that these factors “can dissuade new business entrants, stymie business expansion or hasten closure.” The Commission put forth a list of recommendations to which the government responded in four ways. It either supports the recommendations fully, supports “in principle” only, notes the recommendations, or does not support them altogether. One of the Committee’s recommendations states: “The Government supports this recommendation,” was the response to the above statement. The report further clarifies that “the Government agrees that consumers should not be subject to the GST twice when using digital currency to purchase goods or services.” In March last year, the government released the Backing Australian Fintech statement to address the double taxation of digital currencies. It also established a Fintech Advisory Group “to advise the Treasurer directly on issues important to Australia’s fintech industry, such as identifying areas of potential future reform, and ensuring that the specific priorities of the industry are considered in the implementation of government policies.” One of the fintech priorities outlined in this report was to amend the GST Act of 1999 to recognize bitcoin as money. The government acknowledged the recommendation and also suggested that “AML/CTF laws should apply to digital currencies.” Thursday’s report confirms that “the Government is working with the Fintech Advisory Group on options to reform the current GST treatment of digital currencies.” However, “any change to the GST treatment of digital currencies is subject to formal state and territory agreement,” the report concludes.

Cryptocurrency investors who use the platform to invest in bitcoin and altcoins are showing concern over the announcement across social media.  Also read: Las Vegas Strip Club Aims to Use Cryptocurrency for Daily Operations The cryptocurrency platform Gocelery, otherwise known as “Celery,” is a subsidiary of Btx Trader and was established in 2014. The trading platform is operated by Ilya Subkhankulov and Divya Thakur, who have claimed since the company started that 90 percent of customer funds were held in cold storage. Since 2014, the exchange has operated with little complaints and has also offered customers using Canadian bank accounts zero fees for transactions. During bitcoin’s climatic price rise to the $1600s, Gocelery.com users were notified that the company had suspended deposits and withdrawals until further notice. The trading platform did not give any reasons why they ceased offering these services but informed customers via Twitter and Celery’s update page. The trading platform announced its decision at 9:45 am on May 4, stating:   Because the price is so high and a few other exchanges across the globe have also halted deposits and withdrawals, Celery’s announcement has caused concern. For instance, this past January, Chinese exchanges suspended withdrawals after the country’s central bank began inspecting them. Following China’s exchange issues, the popular exchange Bitfinex also suspended fiat withdrawals, causing bitcoiners to worry. However, the reasons behind these particular suspensions were revealed to the public. Both Chinese exchanges and Bitfinex have not reinstated withdrawals at the time of writing.  Celery’s owner, Btx Trader, has been involved within the cryptocurrency environment since 2013. Btx trader is also a corporate branch of another company, as the firm is a wholly-owned subsidiary of WPCS International Inc. For now, customers believe they will just have to wait until Celery gives the public further information via their update page. The news of various exchanges suspending deposit and withdrawal services has been haunting bitcoiners with memories of Mt Gox. Celery’s suspension is yet another example of an exchange having issues in 2017, but the problem for customers is the company’s silence.

On Thursday, he filed an amendment to the BIT’s registration statement with the SEC which includes two major changes. Also read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF Silbert originally filed the S-1 registration statement form with the SEC on January 20 for the BIT, sponsored by his company, Grayscale Investments LLC. The proposed offering at the time was $500 million. He filed the first amendment to the BIT’s S-1 in March but did not alter the size of the proposed IPO. Then, on Thursday, Silbert filed Amendment No. 2 with the Commission. It revises the BIT’s proposed offering to $1 billion, indicating his confidence in the demand for the BIT. In comparison, Coin ETF’s offering was $100 million and Solidx’s offering was only $1 million. In addition to raising the proposed offering, the BIT’s Amendment No. 2 lists three large financial institutions as authorized participants. According to the amendment: Previously, the BIT shares were distributed solely by Genesis Global Trading Inc. These private placement transactions were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. After the IPO, if the SEC approves, the BIT shares will only be distributed by the authorized participants listed above and no longer by Genesis Global Trading Inc. Xapo remains the BIT’s only custodian. Authorized participants are the only persons that may place orders to create and redeem baskets of the BIT’s shares, according to the filing. “Authorized participants may act for their own accounts or as agents for broker-dealers, custodians and other securities market participants that wish to create or redeem baskets.” The two Bitcoin ETFs which the SEC already rejected did not name any specific authorized participants in their S-1 filings or amendments. The SEC has rejected two Bitcoin ETFs; one on March 10 and the other on March 28. The first decision is currently being reviewed by the Commission following Bats BZX Exchange’s petition for a review. However, the decision to disapprove proposed rule changes for both Bitcoin ETFs concerns the nature of Bitcoin itself and of the Bitcoin market, not company-specific filings. The SEC cites the reasons for rejecting the listing and trading of Bitcoin ETFs as: Unless the outcome of the SEC’s review changes the above, most people in the Bitcoin community believe that no Bitcoin ETF will be approved in the near future. The Commission has designated May 10 as the date it would make a decision on the BIT’s proposed rule change. However, this deadline could be extended further. Do you think Barry Silbert can get his Bitcoin Investment Trust approved? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-05-05T06:00:58-04:00,U.S. Government Cracks Down on Illegal Bitcoin Money Transmitters,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/government-cracks-down-on-illegal-bitcoin-money-transmitters/,"Owning and operating a money transmitter service in the U.S. is “illegal” unless it is registered with State agencies. Unfortunately, this is also true if one uses Bitcoin to exchange for fiat currency. Bitcoin is not immune from State or Federal laws regulating the flow of money, and agents can track bitcoin transfers over the blockchain. Also read: Bitcoin Advocates Prepare to Fight the California Bitlicense These facts have become more apparent in the last few years as at least 4 people have been arrested and charged with financial crimes related to the “illegal” transmission of Bitcoin. All the cases involved individuals allegedly exchanging Bitcoin for a fee. Some of the individuals advertised these services online in a furtive or overt fashion. They were caught after local or federal agents began an investigation, and sometimes after the “suspects” transferred bitcoin to an undercover officer for a fee. However, sometimes there was not even an investigation, only suspicion and an ill-gotten warrant. Missouri Case In a recently circulated case, a Missouri man pleaded guilty to conducting an unlicensed and unregulated money transmitter service. The man, Jason R. Klein, posted advertisements on the internet to exchange Bitcoin for cash. The Missouri attorneys office statement said, Klein is subject to receive a penalty of up to five years in prison without parole. Arizona Case In another recent case covered by Bitcoin.com, an Arizona man named Thomas Constanzo, AKA Morpheus, was accused of possibly running an illegal money transmitter service…but was only charged with possessing “60 cartridges of ammunition.” Some think this is more a politically-motivated charge, since alleged crimes of illegal money transmission were not leveled. A warrant for running a money transmitter service was issued alongside the arrest for the ammo cartridges. “A warrant signed by U.S. Magistrate Judge David Duncan sought evidence that Costanzo may have operated an “unlicensed money transmitting business,” engaged in illegal drug sales, and tried to hide any profits.” Constanzo was considered a “flight risk” and was not provided the opportunity for bail. Ohio Case In a more complex case, an Ohio man named Daniel Mercede was charged with using stolen credit card information to buy concert tickets and resell them for a profit. After a prolonged investigation involving a home search, cops learned of ongoing money transmitter crimes. Allegedly, agents figured out that Mercede was purchasing large quantities of Bitcoin from overseas exchanges and reselling them at a premium. An FBI article about the case explained what they found and the sentence they handed down, New York Case In a New York case that occurred between 2014 and 2015, a man on probation for transferring child pornography, named Richard Petix, pleaded guilty to running an “illegal money transmitting business” and “making false statements.” On December 3, 2015, Petix conducted a bitcoin exchange with a federal agent in Buffalo, New York. He sent 37 bitcoins to the officer, worth about $13,000 at the time. He was also on probation, and allegedly lied about having access to the computer where the transaction occurred. The New York attorneys office summarized his activities, “Between August, 2014, and December 3, 2015, Petix conducted over 100 Bitcoin transactions wherein he transferred over $200,000 in bitcoins to customers both locally and across the United States. At least some of these customers then used the bitcoins to purchase controlled substances from dark net vendors. At no time during this period did Petix comply with federal money transmitting business registration requirements.” These cases represent a government crack down on the use of bitcoin to exchange cash for a fee, although in some cases the transmitter service was stumbled on by accident (Mercede) or not found at all (Constanzo). Needless to say, government has become aggressive in regards to thwarting illicit use of Bitcoin by underground, black market actors. They are now willing to hand out warrants or conduct investigations even if the evidence is tentative, nonexistent, or amounts to a witch hunt. Governments also have the tools and understanding to track bitcoin addresses and obtain computers that harbor wallets. Currently, it seems ill-advised for anyone to attempt to transfer bitcoin in exchange for cash. In the least, anyone interested in subverting government laws should acknowledge that Bitcoin is only pseudo-anonymous and digital currency trails can be traced. With that said, government possessing authority to tell people how to spend their money is a controversial subject. Many have decried government assaults on these “criminals” as an attack on individual liberty, a person’s right to their property, and ability to spend their money how they see fit. Do you believe even more people will be arrested for operating “illegal” bitcoin exchanges in the near future? Do you believe people should be punished for spending their money as they see fit?

The private spacecraft company’s 4,425 broadband satellites will create a “mesh network” which could boost Bitcoin’s decentralization. Also read: Do You Think They’ll Use the US Dollar on Mars? Founded in 2002 by CEO Elon Musk, Spacex designs, manufactures and launches advanced rockets and spacecraft “to revolutionize space technology, with the ultimate goal of enabling people to live on other planets,” its website describes. The company has been taking astronauts and supplies to and from the International Space Station since May 2012, providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA. Today, it employs around 6,000 people and has three vehicles: Falcon9, Falcon Heavy, and Dragon. Last November, Spacex filed an application for satellite space station authorizations with the US Federal Communications Commission. “Spacex wants to launch 4,425 satellites into low-Earth orbits, with altitudes ranging from 715 miles to 823 miles” to offer gigabit-speed broadband internet to the world, Ars Technica reported. Then, on Wednesday, Spacex followed up with new details during a Senate hearing at the U.S. Capitol. The company revealed “its planned constellation of 4,425 broadband satellites will launch from the Falcon 9 rocket beginning in 2019 and continue launching in phases until reaching full capacity in 2024,” Ars Technica reports. In a testimony to the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation, Spacex’s Vice President of Satellite Government Affairs, Patricia Cooper, said: Mesh networking has long been discussed in the Bitcoin community as a better configuration to deploy Bitcoin nodes globally. “Mesh networks promise to build decentralized, ubiquitous, resilient, and community-owned network infrastructure,” explained Shaddi Hasan of UC Berkeley, in his 2013 masters thesis ‘Designing Networks for Large-Scale Blackout Circumvention.’ “This vision is admittedly compelling, particularly for those working against Internet censorship,” he wrote. Such a network should, in theory, allow Bitcoin nodes to route around controls by any one government or other types of blockages, making them ideal for use with Bitcoin. Wednesday’s presentation by Spacex confirms that their new, space-based infrastructure for the internet would be a type of mesh network, offering accessibility and resilience that Bitcoin users are looking for. Whether Bitcoin nodes can use Spacex’s network or not depends on the company’s policies which have yet to be announced. So far, little information has been given about terms of use. In Wednesday’s hearing, Cooper said that their customers would access this network via “Spacex user terminals,” which are “essentially, a relatively small flat panel, roughly the size of a laptop.” They will “use similar phased array technologies to allow for highly directive, steered antenna beams that track the system’s low-Earth orbit satellites,” she described. However, she did not offer any more details on whether third party software could be loaded or confirm whether Spacex’s network will force users to connect only through their terminals.

Also read: Bitcoin Price Goes Full Throttle Blasting Past $1500 Bitcoin markets have been wild lately with massive trading volume as the price is higher than it’s ever been before. Currently, the price per bitcoin is coasting along at an average of roughly US$1550-60 with 24-hour global trade volume reaching $700 million across worldwide exchanges on May 4.  Throughout this time many bitcoin participants and spectators are curious to know who is trading the most bitcoin these days. Many news outlets are pointing to Japan as interest has increased significantly in the region. It’s also being said that Japanese trading is capturing the lion’s share of bitcoin daily trade volume. However at present JPY trading is roughly tied with USD bitcoin trade volume, and CNY numbers follow slightly behind.  According to Coinmarketcap.com statistics between the U.S. exchanges such as GDAX, Bitstamp, Kraken, Bitfinex, and Gemini are showing USD/BTC trading at roughly $73 million over the past 24-hours. Japanese exchanges are also trading $73 million USD worth of JPY/BTC per day between Bitflyer, Coincheck, Zaif, and Quoine. Volume from China is a touch lower as traders see $45 million in daily trades with Huobi, BTCC, and Okcoin volumes. China was once the global leader in bitcoin trades in 2016 but that all changed when trading platforms halted withdrawals and added fees to every trade. Just behind China is Europe, as total percentages of overall Euro trading is around $31.4 million between three major European bitcoin exchanges. Statistics do show that USD and JPY trade volume is higher than ever before, but some believe these numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. For instance, when China dominated bitcoin markets it was because trading platforms allowed trading without fees which inflated CNY volumes drastically. Since the Chinese exchanges added fees BTC/CNY trade volumes in China have plummeted. One attractive benefit to Japanese bitcoin trading is the fact that exchange’s from the region do not charge fees per trade. This makes skeptics leery of Japanese bitcoin trading volume as JPY statistics may be inflated due to this reason. Secondly, U.S. volumes are high, but that may have a lot to do with Bitfinex market volumes right now. Out of the $73 million in USD 24-hour trade volume, Bitfinex is capturing $30 million of that share at the time of writing. However Bitfinex prices are through the roof right now since the exchange suspended USD withdrawals. Currently, one bitcoin is trading for $1630 on the Bitfinex trading platform which is well above every other exchange that facilitates USD trades. Nevertheless, people are focused heavily on Japan because the government just recently legalized bitcoin as a form of payment. Furthermore, the bitcoin exchanges Bitflyer and Coincheck hope to encourage thousands of merchants to adopt bitcoin by this summer. To add to all of that many institutional investors are seeing Japan as cryptocurrency hotspot and rumor has it many more exchanges plan on operating in the country. Mainstream acceptance of bitcoin is also doing well in many other regions worldwide. In the U.S., China and Europe lawmakers are also preparing legislative guidelines for bitcoin use within each country as leaders see trade volumes and popularity has been rising consistently in these countries for well over a year.

According to many bitcoin proponents, the bill AB 1123 is nearly an exact copy of the AB 1326 California bitlicense which was defeated over the past two years. Also read: Mexico’s Government Officials Discuss Plans to Regulate Bitcoin California lawmakers are currently contemplating implementing a bitcoin-focused business license law for companies residing in the western U.S. state. The bill is very similar to last year’s AB 1326 bitlicense bill with only a few minor changes. “The bill would prohibit a person from engaging in any virtual currency business, as defined, in this state unless the person is licensed by the Commissioner of Business Oversight or is exempt from the licensure requirement, as provided,” explains the California assembly bill 1123. Of course, bitcoin proponents are not too pleased with the revised version of the AB 1326 bitlicense legislation. Many of bitcoin community members are asking people to contact California legislators like Matt Dababneh and Governor Jerry Brown to show disapproval of this proposed virtual currency act. Furthermore, one member of the cryptocurrency community has been in contact with the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) who told him they would be opposing bill 1123 as they have in the past. “I’ve been following up with EFF and just got word from them that they are opposing AB 1123 as they did with AB 1326,” explains a Redditor discussing the newly revised bill.  Additionally, there’s a website called Nobitcoinlicense.org dedicated to fighting the California bitlicense which is backed by the Internet advocacy organizations Taskforce, Fight For The Future, and the EFF. The website states it is too early to create a California bitlicense and the bill is a threat to innovation. The site also explains that the bill has many technical inaccuracies and definitions that are too vague. Moreover, if the bill becomes recognized into law the application process for licensure offers no due process. “License applications can be rejected for any reason, with no administrative appeal. This will create difficulties for startups and innovators,” details the ‘Say No to the California Bitcoin License’ website. The website against the California bill provides residents with the appropriate methods for contacting the state’s senators either by email or phone. Bitcoin proponents across cryptocurrency-centric forums seem hopeful they can defeat this bill as they have years prior. The primary goal for those who oppose the California bitlicense is to stop the precedent that Ben Lawsky and New York legislators started. When the New York bitlicense was approved a vast amount of bitcoin, and blockchain-based companies left the region. However, they also stopped serving residents of New York state, and bitcoin proponents fear this will happen in California as well. What do you think about the California bitlicense? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Nobitcoinlicense.org, and the EFF.   Do you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread? Thought so. That’s why we are building this online universe revolving around anything and everything Bitcoin. We have a store. And a forum. And a casino, a mining pool, and real-time price statistics. "
2017-05-04T06:47:34-04:00,Bitcoin Price Goes Full Throttle Blasting Past $1500,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-goes-full-throttle-blasting-past-1500/,"Over the past week, the market value of bitcoin has been on a tear. On May 3rd the price per BTC hit another record high of US$1518 on Bitstamp and even higher across other global exchanges. Also read: Mexico’s Government Officials Discuss Plans to Regulate Bitcoin Many bitcoiners have been celebrating the spring months of April and May, as the past few weeks has seen all-time price highs for bitcoin. Cryptocurrency proponents were quite pleased when BTC’s fiat value rose above the $1400 mark and were subsequently surprised when $1500 came quickly after. At press time the price per BTC had reached $1547 after dipping into the $1490s several times.  Short term technical indicators and order books show there is substantial resistance above the $1500 range at the time of writing. However, the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still maintaining well above the longer term 200 SMA showing the bull market engines are still at full throttle. Although the Relative Strength Index and Stochastic indicators show we may be in overbought territory and things could get choppy. Nevertheless, bitcoin volume is strong capturing roughly $300-500 million per day this week as the decentralized cryptocurrency now commands a $24.2 billion market. No one knows the primary reason why bitcoin’s price is rising so fast. There could be various things to consider that are attributing to bitcoin’s soaring market value. Mainstream media has put out a few articles highlighting bitcoin’s increase in value which could be enticing investor interest. Countries like India, Japan, and China have continued to show significant demand as global interest in bitcoin stemming from many regions has been at an all-time high. Furthermore many governments in areas such as Mexico, India, and other countries look as though they may legalize and regulate the digital currency. The approval from worldwide leaders may be giving bitcoin markets positive reinforcement, a far different approach than their warnings in the past. Overall the fact of the matter is it’s hard not to notice bitcoin’s performance and adoption growth over the previous year. High prices, positive news, and global interest continues to bring more users into the world of cryptocurrency for various reasons. As usual bitcoin community members are thrilled to see the decentralized currency do so well. People have been celebrating all over social media with tweets, price ticker pictures, and their favorite bitcoin memes. Overall the past twenty-four hours has been exciting as the trading day began in the low $1440s. The heaviest trading region has been Japan as the country has captured a majority of the global trade volume. According to CNBC, the Japanese exchange Bitflyer is seeing massive demand. This is also followed by strong trading volumes stemming from the U.S. and China as well. Bear Scenario: The price of $1500 per BTC is a highly psychological mark, and it will take time to find ground above this range. According to order books across various global exchanges and depth charts, there’s strong support between the $1400-1450 territory. There’s sure to be plenty of volatile action for intra-range moves and day traders looking for quick dips. Bull Scenario: At press time bitcoin is wiping off the sweat from breaking $1500 and trying to hold its position. If buyers keep up the action and bitcoin breaks current resistance the path to $1600 could very well be achieved. Bulls are controlling the market and keeping the momentum going on the upside. The question is — How much longer can they keep it up? What do you think about the price of bitcoin breaking $1500? Where do you see the price going from here? Let us know in the comments below.

Two government officials have recently revealed some details of how the digital currency will be regulated, according to local publications. Also read:Â Mexicoâs New Bill Could Be a Game Changer for Bitcoin Jose Bernardo Gonzalez, Head of the Mexican Finance Ministry’s Banking, Securities and Savings Unit, said that Bitcoin exists in a free market and cannot be controlled, El Universal reports. In statements made to the publication, he explained how the laws would allow the central bank to regulate bitcoin buyers and sellers, stating that (loosely translated): He further clarified that the regulators would ensure there are âcertain rules to prevent money laundering, user protection and so on.” Specifically, they “would check that these assets are sufficiently liquid and would define the operating characteristics with which financial intermediaries or fintechÂ companies can offer these assets to the public,” he described. The initiative proposed by the government to modernize Mexicoâs fintech sector includes a section about Bitcoin. It was recently presented to the financial sector and was well received, according to Gonzalez.Â Traditional banks and brokerage firms in Mexico provided feedback and suggestions. Many are positive and look forward to Bitcoin being regulated, he told El Universal. âThey are seeing that there is complementarity between traditional institutions and the fintech sector,” he recalled. In a recent Senate appearance, the Governor of the Bank of Mexico, Agustin Carstens, talked about this fintech initiative as well. “The goal is how to take advantage of technological innovation that can reduce costs and increase the reach of the financial system, but everything must be in an environment of prudence and security towards users,” he said. The governor also disclosed that he is confident the initiative will be approved this year. Carstens also recently revealed that the central bank has been running âvery low scaleâ tests with Bitcoin to learn how it works, Forbes reports. He explained that prior to regulating Bitcoin, the bank needs to familiarize itself with the digital currency and its technology. In addition, the publication wrote: The governor has some concerns, however. “The worrying thing is that periodically there are technological, hacking and theft problems, and that makes us very nervous. Yes, we have to be fully assured of technological integrity, well armored, and not expose the public,â he conveyed. Moreover, he detailed how the central bank will make sure that financial authorities are properly set up to observe and ensure that âthe technological support is solid and robust, in order to avoid risks for users.â Nonetheless, more testing is needed first, he told Forbes.

2017-05-03T05:00:49-04:00,Bitcoin in Denmark â Facts & Figures 2017,Bitcoin.com,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-denmark-facts-figures-2017/,"This is a paid press release, which contains forward looking statements,Â and should be treated as advertising or promotional material. Bitcoin.com does not endorse nor support this product/service. Bitcoin.com is not responsible for or liable for any content, accuracy or quality within the press release. Denmark has always been known for its interest in going cashless and getting technology companies to invest in its projects. Along with a few other countries, Denmark wants to completely get rid of cash. Experts are of the opinion that Denmark may become the worldâs first cashless country. At the time of writing, the Danish Central Bank is weighing the pros and cons of using blockchain to create E-Krone, a digital currency to reduce cost of transaction. Denmark may also be the first country in the world to appoint an ambassador to represent its interests in the biggest technology companies in the world. Denmark is a world leader in innovation in areas such as pharmaceutical sciences, telecommunications, IT, and design. Experts consider it to be at the forefront of financial technology development. The country is definitely going to benefit a lot by being technology as well as Bitcoin friendly. Already, Denmark is reaping profits because of its attitude towards technology and Bitcoin. Denmark is not only one of the most Bitcoin friendly countries in the world, but it is also one of the first to declare Bitcoin trade to be tax free. In March 2014, the Central Bank of Denmark announced that Bitcoin cannot be considered as a currency. Moreover, Anders Samuelsen of the Liberal Alliance is familiar with Bitcoin and his party accepts bitcoin donations. In fact, in 2014, the Liberal Alliance was the first political party in Denmark to use blockchain technology in an internal election. Although Denmark is familiar with Bitcoin and accepts it, bitcoins are still not widely used in the country. One can still not say when exactly Denmark will start using Bitcoin as an alternative to the current banking system or a means of exchange. The Central Bank has refused to regulate the use of Bitcoin within the borders of Denmark, but the country is home to several Bitcoin exchanges and start-ups. One of them is CCEDK, which is known for its innovation in blockchain technology. Recently, it released decentralized exchange and Bitcoin 3.0 technology. Speaking about Bitcoin, CCEDK CEO Ronny Boesing said: âDenmark was recently voted being the happiest country in the world, and the open mind towards cryptocurrency is just another reason to be happy living in Denmark.â Shortly after Denmark announced its plans to completely do away with cash in the spring of 2015, the trading volume at LocalBitcoins has shown steady growth in demand for the cryptocurrency. Another interesting development was observed in the cybercrime unit of the Denmark police. They developed advanced software to track transactions made in bitcoins so that they could nab drug traffickers. In fact, Bitcoin transactions are anonymous, but it has a pseudonym nature that makes it very easy for anybody to track transactions made in bitcoins. All they have to do is examine the public blockchain. Moreover, the wallet addresses can be easily viewed, making it possible to track transactions. This information, however, has nothing to do with bitcoin usersâ personal information such as names and physical addresses. The fact that bitcoin transactions can be traced makes it very easy for surveillance companies such as Elliptic and various law enforcement agencies to control criminals who try to abuse the advantages that Bitcoin offers. Currently, Bitcoin is not permitted in online casinos regulated in Denmark. But this may change in the future, especially as no individual is taxed for profits earned through bitcoin trading. Moreover, the Financial Services Authority and the Government of Denmark have announced that all businesses dealing with bitcoins will have to pay taxes. The Financial Services Authority also wants the government to amend the laws so that it can regulate all virtual currencies, including bitcoins. Taking into consideration all the above mentioned facts, one can safely state that Bitcoin popularity is on the rise. Press Contact Email Address

2017-05-02T12:30:23-04:00,Hacked South Korean Bitcoin Exchange Yapizon Offers IOUs,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/hacked-korean-bitcoin-exchange-yapizon-offers-ious/,"This past week a South Korean bitcoin exchange called Yapizon was hacked for 3816 BTC or roughly $5.3 million USD worth of bitcoins on Saturday, April 22. The exchange has made a statement concerning the hack and plans to offer an IOU token to its customer base to cover losses. Also read: Bitcoin’s Price Moon Bound Breaking $1400 and Climbing According to the bitcoin exchange Yapizon, four of the company’s hot wallets were compromised on April 22, between 2:00 to 3:00 in the morning. Yapizon says roughly 36 percent of funds were stolen and they have filed a complaint with the Cyber Investigation Division of Seoul, the local police. After the hack, Yapizon says they have spoken with their legal team and have decided to split the loss among its customer base.    “After many discussions, legal and accounting consultations and reviews, we have come to the conclusion that it should be applied fairly to all members,” explains the Yapizon exchange. “It is also the most common way to go through the liquidation process.” The trading platform details that they are not spreading losses to KRW accounts but only virtual holdings including BTC, ETH, and LTC. Yapizon says executives and the CEO have relinquished property rights to resolve the case and will be paying its members with a token called “Fei.” Furthermore, the Korean exchange says they will also provide customers the opportunity to trade the Fei into shares of Yapizon’s “Yahoo Japan” stock.   After hearing the news, many bitcoin proponents were dismayed to hear the exchange was using the same IOU method Bitfinex used this past summer. According to Bitfinex, the company has reimbursed all of the losses from the breach in August. However, many bitcoiners commenting on the Yapizon issue say that Bitfinex has created a dangerous standard for hacked exchanges. Even the Korean exchange details that Bitfinex had set a precedent for their decision.    “There is a precedent,” details Yapizon’s theft announcement. “The largest Bitcoin trading company in the world, known as Bitfinex in Hong Kong, was hacked in August 2016 and suffered a loss of 120,000 bitcoins (about 22 billion won), and its assets were down by about 36%. The exchange is a relatively small trading platform amongst larger exchanges in the South Korean region like Bithumb, Korbit, and Coinone. Yapizon doesn’t detail any more information about the incident, and the exchange does not seem to be operational. The Korean company does give details on the Fei distribution process but does not disclose when that will happen. “We are sorry to have caused an economic loss to you,” Yapizon adds. “We will do our utmost to maximize profits for our members by minimizing the loss and increasing the price of ‘Fei’ through the growth of our company and growing our shareholder value.” What do you think about the Yapizon exchange hack?

2017-05-02T06:00:26-04:00,Bitcoin Exchanges Multiply in Japan as Demand from Institutional Investors Rises,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-exchanges-japan-demand-institutional-investors-rises/,"One short month after Japan started recognizing Bitcoin as a method of payment, more than ten new companies in the country are reportedly applying to become bitcoin exchanges. Meanwhile, institutional investors are increasingly gaining interest in the digital currency. Also read: Bitcoin to Be Accepted at 260,000 Stores in Japan by This Summer On April 1, Japan officially began recognizing Bitcoin as a method of payment. A week later, some major retailers announced their plans to accept the digital currency. Bic Camera, using the payment system provided by the world’s largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bitflyer, started accepting bitcoin at two of its stores on April 7. Meanwhile, bitcoin exchange Coincheck has partnered with Recruit Lifestyle to bring bitcoin payments to over 260,000 stores by this summer. In addition, the Japanese government has announced that starting in July consumption tax will no longer apply to the sales and purchases of bitcoin. Soon, more than 10 new companies will be entering the space for the first time, Nikkei Asian Review reports on Tuesday, citing that the new regulations require bitcoin exchanges in Japan to obtain a special license. The Japan Cryptocurrency Business Association told the publication that approximately 18 businesses are planning to apply for a license, including existing exchanges such as Bitflyer as well. Some major corporations are also entering the race to become bitcoin exchanges, Nikkei details. They include SBI Holidings, GMO Internet Group, Kabi.com Securities and Money Partners Group. Last October, SBI Holidings announced that it was launching a bitcoin exchange called “SBI Virtual Currencies.” The company explained at the time that this platform would provide digital currency exchange and trading services for SBI group companies. In January, Japan’s leading provider of Internet services GMO Internet Group announced its plan to develop a bitcoin exchange and wallet service. The group is “establishing its own company [bitcoin exchange], with plans to increase the number of digital currencies it trades based on demand,” Nikkei confirms this week. Two other companies planning to enter the field are Kabu.com Securities and foreign exchange trader Money Partners Group. Kabu.com Securities is the only dedicated online securities company within the Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group (MUFG) Group. Money Partner Group is one of Japan’s leading foreign exchange brokerage firms. In April 2016, the company invested in San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken. “Many new players are interested in turning such currencies into a new investment option,” Nikkei wrote, adding that a source at one company told them that “there is demand among our clients for cryptocurrencies, given their rising value.” Brian Kelly Capital is an investment management firm catering to institutional investors and high net worth individuals. “I don’t think this is hot money. This is real money that’s going to sit around and build the new internet,” the firm’s founder Brian Kelly said, citing his conversations with institutions and other investors.

Also read:Â Over 100 âBlockchain Personalitiesâ Take 21 Incâs Fork Survey âToday we’ve put out a major new release called 21 Lists with features for both individuals and businesses,â wrote CEO Balaji S. Srinivasan, adding that: This is the second product of this type by the company. Launched in February, âthe first version of 21.co allowed individuals to replace their public emails with an inbox where people could pay to reach them,” the CEO recalls. The previous offeringÂ was tailored for well-known groups with the ability to drive traffic to their profile pages such as CEOs, venture capitalists, and angel investors. The new lists, on the other hand, allow anyone with the right skill sets to make money with 21 Inc without having to deliver any traffic. âOur ideal is that every verified 21 user should qualify for one or more lists, and thereby be able to attract paid messages and tasks even if they arenât famous,â the company said. According to 21 Inc: Anyone can âapply to 21 lists to receive a stream of targeted, paid microtasks,â Srinivasan explains. Currently, there are over 50 lists on the 21.co website and each has its own acceptance criteria. âWe’ll be adding many more,â the CEO notes. Accepted applicants will gain access to a “newsfeed” which is a stream of list-specific tasks sent by businesses. âEvery item in the feed compensates you for your time,â he clarifies. Some lists are easier to qualify for than others. For example, a bitcoin holder can apply to be on Bitcoin-related lists âto allow the founders of new ICOs and distributed ledger products to pay to reach you prior to their launch,â 21 explains. Meanwhile, technical lists such as the Javascript programmers list states that applicants “must be a software engineer with professional knowledge of Javascript.” In addition, âall applications are subject to review,” the company notes, adding that âvalidation of membership may be based on peer review, technical examination, or cryptographic test.â Furthermore, list membership is also subject to ongoing review. âPeriodically, validation tasks may be sent out to confirm that members are in good standing,â 21 Inc details. Businesses can send out mass messages to each list with one click, paying only those who reply. Srinivasan reveals that Hellooffice and SSI have already been using 21 Lists to send out paid mass emails and surveys. âThese initial senders have seen 40-60% response rates at the scale of 100-1000+ users, with 90% of those respondents typically replying within 24 hours,â he claims, adding that âthese numbers are very high relative to typical cold email or survey response rates, which hover at 1-2% response rates.â 21 Inc explains that these microtasks, which they call âmicroconsultingâ, could be viewed as âsomething in between an Amazon Mechanical Turk-style microtask and a conventional job.â The company estimates that: Each list pays a different amount of money, but lists that pay more tend to be more selective, the company notes.

As bitcoin’s successful run continues, many are starting to wonder — How high will the price go? Also read: News Outlets and Journalists Are Being Threatened By Onecoin Lawyers Bitcoin’s value is rising to levels unseen before as the decentralized currency now captures a $23 billion market capitalization. The first quarter of 2017 has been good for bitcoin as the price has remained above 4-digits consistently for most of the year. Furthermore, the price per bitcoin has outperformed every fiat currency in existence and surpassed the spot price of one troy ounce of gold as well. People are beginning to realize bitcoin is a safe haven for failing economies, an escape from capital controls, and a digital asset like no other.  Bitcoin isn’t the only cryptocurrency performing so well. In fact, a great majority of the top twenty token assets according to Coinmarketcap.com have seen significant price rises. The forerunner of all these alternative tokens, Ethereum is second largest market compared to bitcoin and is capturing quite a bit of value very fast. Ethereum has reached an all time high as well reaching $82 per ETH on April 30. Alongside this, Ethereum has amassed a whopping $7 billion dollar market capitalization in mere days. Meanwhile, traditional markets like the NYSE, are floundering compared to the exciting growth of cryptocurrency markets. Overall cryptocurrency markets are now approaching $40 billion in net worth as many altcoins are performing like never before. Many spectators believe digital assets like bitcoin have moved from being a fringe technology to the mainstream this year. Furthermore, bitcoin has managed to shrug off negative news more easily than ever before. Last summer’s Bitfinex incident shocked markets but steadily rebounded after the hack. The news stemming from Chinese bitcoin exchanges this past January suspending withdrawals also gave the price a little hiccup, but subsequently, the BTC price regained its value. Moreover, just recently Bitfinex has announced exchange issues with banking partners and halted USD withdrawals. Once again the ‘Honey Badger’ of money just doesn’t care, and the price has continued to climb. Quite a few speculators and forecasters believe the price will test the $1500-2000 range this year. So far bitcoin is up over 200 percent looking at the year-over-year average and proving to be an unstoppable monetary force. There have been many reasons to why the price of bitcoin is continuing to rise. Some are attributing the demand to countries like Japan, India, and China which are all experiencing exponential bitcoin adoption. Speculators are also pointing at failing centrally planned economies, government’s fiat manipulation, and demonetization, and capital controls stopping individual citizens from moving wealth. Furthermore, research stemming from the Cambridge University study reveals the bitcoin economy is bigger than ever before and continues to grow. It’s exciting to see the bitcoin ecosystem doing so well, especially after the Mt Gox scandal, 2014’s bearish decline, the Bitfinex hack, and the many other negative headlines that seemed to try and slow bitcoin down. The bitcoin train continues to chug forward proving to be the most resilient peer-to-peer currency this world has ever seen. What do you think about bitcoin’s performance?

2017-04-30T12:00:53-04:00,Maybe We Can All Get Along After All â Even in Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/maybe-we-can-all-get-along-after-all-even-in-bitcoin/,"Over the past year, the Bitcoin scaling debate has escalated to new levels. It seems no one can come to an agreement on the best path forward and people have resorted to attacks, slander, and rancorous disputes. Throughout the most recent hostility, a refreshing post on the subreddit r/bitcoin concerning a discussion on the r/btc forum suggests it is still possible we could all get along someday soon. Â  Also read:Â Indiaâs Government May Be Preparing to Legalize and Regulate Bitcoin This Summer Most people don’t realize the block size debate has been taking place since the year it was created. For years now, one small commit to the code in 2010 has caused significant hostility throughout the entire Bitcoin community. â(nBlockSize + nTxSize >= MAX_BLOCK_SIZE – 10000)â was written into the bitcoin protocol by Satoshi Nakamoto in July of 2010. Some believe it was conceived to stop massive spam attacks throughout the network, while others think there is no need for the hard coded 1mb limitation. Â  A few months after the 1mb commit, on October 3, 2010, Jeff Garzik revealed an idea for a patch created by Satoshi to increase the block size limit. Garzik stated at the time, âwe should be able to at least match Paypal’s average transaction rate.â The particular discussion that day was the first of many conversations concerning removing the 1mb limitation. Just three months after the block size limit was implemented the heated debate began. Fast forward to today where scaling discussions seem more bitter, venomous, and literally, never ending. The dispute has been raging on for so long people have grown weary, jaded, and downright tired of the fighting. The infighting has gotten so bad that people have resorted to tactics of attacking members of the bitcoin industry and the censorship of peopleâs opinions. Then there have been meetings between developers, businesses, and miners many times over the years resulting in broken promises. Egos have taken over, and the scaling conversation has spread into multiple discussions about subjects that have nothing to do with the matter. Furthermore, many bitcoin newcomers are seeing a hostile community and are probably dismayed by the nasty energy. Nevertheless, a Reddit thread on April 28 with hundreds of upvotes showed a discussion between two bitcoiners choosing to converse amicably even though they disagreed. Many people thought the post was important because it conveyed the message that ALL Bitcoin proponents can still move forward demonstrating better behavior. One comment from the thread explains the current infighting situation in a unique way; Â Â  The best way Bitcoin proponents can move forward is with healthy discussions using logic and reason as opposed to irrational emotions. We should pay attention to other people’s opinions and respect that many people will have different ideas about scaling Bitcoin. Maybe some of us discussing the issue in an emotional manner need to take a step back, pause and get more grounded. There are many things all of us within the Bitcoin âcommunityâ can do to better approach the discussion because we all want the same thing for Bitcoin. We all want Bitcoin to be the most successful cryptocurrency on the face of the earth, but some have lost sight of the goal with all the drama. We bitcoiners have created a $21.7 billion dollar market and $1300 bitcoins because we all fought long and hard for the digital currency to succeed. The bottom line is we all want the same thing, and some of us disagree on the best path for bitcoin. However, most Bitcoin proponents would agree, now more than ever, we should be civilized and move forward by using better communication skills and demonstrating debate without emotions. What do you think about the scaling debate lately? Do you think at some point we can all come to an agreement and move forward? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

2017-04-30T06:00:12-04:00,Is Bitcoin at Risk as Google and IBM Aim for 50-Qubit Quantum Computers?,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/is-bitcoin-at-risk-as-google-and-ibm-aim-for-50-qubit-quantum-computers/,"A looming concern in the crypto community is whether quantum computing will destroy Bitcoin’s underlying protocol. People are worried government agencies or other nefarious entities will crack bitcoin’s code with quantum algorithms and undermine blockchain technology. In reality, these fears reflect more of an imagined doomsday scenario than a true statement about future events. Also read: Antonopoulos Details Bitcoin’s Two Layers of Protection Against Quantum Computing There are two main reasons why bitcoiners should be skeptical about quantum computing threats to blockchain technology. People tend to wallow in fear, uncertainty, and doubt regarding new technology. They assume new technology implies some type of inevitable apocalypse. Many of their omens, however, are steeped in voodoo and superstition. They are either exaggerated or false. First, Bitcoin’s encryption is not wholly vulnerable to quantum computing. Satoshi Nakomoto knew about the possibility of stronger computer power being able to penetrate encryption, and that is why he built the protocol to withstand attacks. Second, even if a government agency or other organization possessed the talent to bust Bitcoin’s encryption, they would likely forgo the opportunity. Before delving further into these points, it is important to have knowledge of how quantum computers work, and how they differ from traditional machines. Quantum computers are built on processors containing units called qubits, also called quantum bits. These units take advantage of quantum mechanics by functioning outside the realm of the Newtonian space. In other words, they do not conform to the rules governing the macroscopic, visually perceptible world. They behave according to the mystical order of the subatomic. Instead of engaging in the binary behavior of 0’s and 1’s in the usual “on” and “off” fashion, quantum computers fuse “0’s” and “1’s,” making them indistinguishable and interconnected. This paradoxical feature allows quantum computers to make tremendously enormous calculations. For example, to comprehend the difference between a laptop and a quantum computer’s calculation abilities, think of the differences between a horse-drawn chariot and Space-X’s Dragon spacecraft. This analogy expresses how much of an advantage quantum machines have over dinosaur-age computers. The idea that 0’s and 1’s can be fused is called superposition in quantum physics. This is the idea that on a subatomic scale, particles take on properties of other particles. For instance, it is well known that light can be both a particle and a wave. This phenomenon is called particle-wave duality. Furthermore, particles can also merge. In accordance with quantum mechanics, they become enjoined in a delicate dance of vibratory ecstasy. This peculiar behavior is called entanglement, and this occurs within the confines of a computer chip the same as it does across the universe-at-large. When dealing with quantum computers, controlling these states on an microcosmic scale with ultracold processors is difficult. This is the reason why quantum computers have not readily materialized and become commercially available. Currently, quantum computers are in the early stages of development. They have only been used for specific purposes or specific projects. There is little practical application for them. However, a Newsweek article published on April 7 said they could be implemented sooner rather than later and could be more powerful than our most advanced supercomputer: However, regardless of how powerful these computers are and how soon they are created, Bitcoin’s encryption protocol will likely remain safe. There are many questions about what exactly will occur when the black cat is set loose from Pandora’s Box, but some things we know for sure. Bitcoin’s underlying encryption protocol, SHA-256, is stubbornly resistant to nefarious attempts to undermine it. It is likely strong enough to withstand assaults from even the most savage quantum computer onslaught. A bitcoinnotbombs.com article explained that SHA-256 is formidable enough to handle the attacks: “In Bitcoin your public key isn’t (initially) made public. While you share your Bitcoin address with others so that they can send you bitcoins, your Bitcoin address is only a hash of your public key, not the public key itself. What does that mean in English? A hash function is a one-way cryptographic function that takes an input and turns it into a cryptographic output. By one-way I mean that you can’t derive the input from the output. It’s kind of like encrypting something then losing the key.” They continued, Another reason why agencies or other bad actors will not crack the bitcoin code is less obvious. Assuming it was possible to exploit, they might not want to crack it. This sounds silly…because breaking bitcoin’s encryption would help government protect their antiquated financial monopoly from bitcoin’s rapid, decentralized growth. There are good reasons, though. If they choose to crack the protocol, they expose their quantum capabilities to their rivals. This spurs their enemies to develop counter-technology. Jamie Redman, writing for Bitcoin.com, elaborated by quoting bitcoin security expert Andreas Antonopoulos, Of course, there are arguments against this position. There could be individuals within these organizations that could act alone to crack the protocol. Arguably, anyone with the knowledge and technology to dismantle bitcoin’s encryption could do so at anytime—and what is scary—is that no one would know precisely who did it. The fact that no one has conducted this kind of quantum hack, however, is demonstrated by the fact that everyone’s coins are still stored safely in their wallets. Those involved in the cryptocurrency ecosystem should not lose sleep agonizing over the possibility of random people cracking the protocol. Best case scenario quantum computing is not poised to undermine bitcoin’s foundational technology. Worst case scenario, the technology to attack bitcoin is already here, but no one feels incentivized enough to crack it. Nonetheless, there is a concern from security experts that the bitcoin protocol should upgrade from SHA-256 to SHA-384, which is a sufficiently more advanced form of cryptography. This would be done as a safety measure, just in case. That is why Satoshi Nakomoto ensured the algorithm could easily be upgraded and enhanced. He knew technology would steadily evolve and he wanted his open-source, peer-to-peer system to evolve with it. Therefore, even if bad actors decided to lay siege to the protocol, the good guys would have time to re-engineer it to withstand attack. They would likewise be able to improve the encryption mechanism to function in lockstep with the quantum computers that enabled the security breech to begin with. In this sense, Bitcoin’s underlying technology boasts tremendous flexibility in the way it can be tweaked for the purposes of self-defense and maturation over the long-term.

2017-04-29T19:00:27-04:00,Antigua and Barbuda Drafts Laws to ‘Implement’ Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/antigua-and-barbuda-drafts-laws-to-implement-bitcoin/,"The government of Antigua and Barbuda is drafting laws “for the implementation of Bitcoin,” according to a local publication. The decision may have been influenced by online gambling mogul Calvin Ayre and even the self-proclaimed “Bitcoin creator” Craig Wright. Also read: Craig Wright-associated Nchain Claimed to Be Largest Acquisition in Bitcoin History The Cabinet of the twin-island country Antigua and Barbuda has instructed their Attorney General, Steadroy Benjamin, “to draft laws for the implementation of Bitcoin,” reports the Antigua Observer. Antigua and Barbuda is a Commonwealth nation located in the Caribbean Sea, east of Puerto Rico. The move follows the Cabinet’s meeting with a group connected with the Antigua Leisure and Gaming Association on Wednesday, the publication describes, adding that Bitcoin was discussed as “a new method of transacting the sale of goods and services.” At the post-Cabinet briefing on Thursday, the Minister of Trade and Consumer Affairs, EP Chet Greene said: “Here in Antigua & Barbuda we know we are always very much front and centre of new developments; we are leaders, trendsetters in the Caribbean.” He then explained his country’s interest in Bitcoin: Primarily a tourism-driven economy, Antigua and Barbuda has a few casinos on the island as well as a growing Internet gaming industry. Greene also said: “The currency benefits us in Antigua & Barbuda in respect to our Internet gaming sector. It will allow us the satisfaction needed as a jurisdiction in respect to questions that would be asked of us in the global environment,” the Antigua Observer wrote. Last June, Reuters reported that the self-proclaimed “Bitcoin creator” Craig Wright had been building a large portfolio of Bitcoin and blockchain patents. Applications for more than 50 patents were filed in Britain through Antigua-registered EITC Holdings Ltd, with plans to apply for about 400 patents in total. Originally known as Ncrypt, EITC Holdings later rebranded as Nchain following its acquisition by Sicav plc. The Antigua Observer’s article erroneously notes that the price of bitcoin “has increased in value several times since it was patented.” Bitcoin is open source and uses the MIT license for free software, therefore it cannot be patented. Moreover, a document reviewed by Reuters reveals that, in 2015, Wright “planned to propose to the Antigua government that the island adopt bitcoin as its official currency.” His proposal for Antigua reads: “Bitcoin is not just a currency.[…] It’s a new backbone and commercial foundation for the internet.” Wright also has the backing of Calvin Ayre, a wealthy Canadian entrepreneur who lives in Antigua. Ayre has been indicted in the U.S. on charges of running illegal online gambling operations, which he has denied. He began construction of a $25 million call center in Antigua in October, claiming “it was part of his vision for Bitcoin and online gaming,” Reuters reported and quoted Ayre saying: While the government prepares to draft the laws concerning Bitcoin, Greene is encouraging the public to learn more about the cryptocurrency online, the Antigua Observer reports.

2017-04-29T12:00:57-04:00,Arizona Localbitcoins Trader Detained by U.S. Homeland Security,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/arizona-localbitcoins-trader-detained-homeland-security/,"A well-known bitcoin blogger and Localbitcoins trader was taken into custody by Federal law enforcement agencies in Arizona last week. Thomas Costanzo, otherwise known as “Morpheus” is allegedly being investigated for digital currency money laundering charges. Also Read: Bitcoin’s Triumphant Q1 Price Resilience and Performance Surpassed All Fiat Currencies According to local reports and warrants obtained by the libertarian news outlet Freedom’s Phoenix Costanzo was detained by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security when officers raided his home on April 20. Costanzo is a well-known figure within Bitcoin and agorism-focused circles for his “Bitcoin and Cash” blog and libertarian writings. A report published by the Phoenix New Times details that law enforcement agents are investigating Costanzo’s monetary dealings with bitcoin and other altcoins. Costanzo sold mining equipment, bitcoin ATMs, and sold cryptocurrency for an occupation over the past few years. According to the regional publication, Costanzo is a popular Arizona trader who used Localbitcoins, and agents were authorized to confiscate financial records and any illegal contraband in his home. Law enforcement officials obtained a warrant from U.S. Magistrate Judge David Duncan to search Costanzo’s residence in Maricopa County. According to reports, Costanzo has only been charged with possession of 60 cartridges of ammunition, but warrants and investigators suggest federal authorities are also looking into his “unlicensed money transmitting business.” Costanzo appeared at his detention hearing on April 27 and was subsequently denied bail. According to sources, the court believes Costanzo is a “flight risk” and will be held in custody until his trial begins. Federal prosecutors told U.S. Magistrate Judge Michelle Burns that Costanzo has a history of skipping out on warrants and other criminal court cases. The case has also been controversial across social media platforms as some critics have said the case has nothing to do with cryptocurrency. So far Costanzo is only charged with the ammunition possession. However other sources such as the Phoenix New Times suggest the investigation is likely a direct result of a cryptocurrency anti-money laundering crackdown by U.S. federal agencies. People with these opinions believe it’s a bit extreme for Homeland Security to be arresting Costanzo for a mere sixty cartridges of Winchester ammunition.    How do you feel about a Localbitcoins trader being detained by the police?

2017-04-29T06:00:08-04:00,West Virginia Bill Aims to Define Bitcoin as a Monetary Instrument,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/west-virginia-bill-define-bitcoin-monetary-instrument/,"West Virginia bureaucrats are moving forward to define bitcoin and other digital currencies with an anti-money laundering (AML) bill. The state’s latest House Bill 2585 will add bitcoin to the regions’ AML statutes defining virtual currencies as a ‘monetary instrument.’ Also Read: Bitcoin’s Triumphant Q1 Price Resilience and Performance Surpassed All Fiat Currencies West Virginia is headed in the same direction as Florida as the state’s House representatives are pushing for new bitcoin AML regulations. West Virginia House Bill 2585 will now be reviewed by Governor Jim Justice for his approval. In essence, the bill gives a legal definition to the new technologies that constitute as monetary instruments, most notably instruments such as bitcoin operating “independently of a central bank.” House Bill 2585 states: Monetary instruments are traditionally defined as fiat currency and checks, but will include gift cards, prepaid cards, and cryptocurrency, under the newly revised statutes if approved. The bill has passed in the House by a 78–21 vote and the legislation also passed unanimously during the Senate hearing. If the bill becomes law after the governor’s approval, West Virginians caught laundering funds using bitcoin will be subject to felonies and forfeiture. “‘Cryptocurrency’ means digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds,” explains the West Virginia Bill. The bill is very much like the new proposed legislation introduced in Florida recognizing bitcoin as a monetary instrument. West Virginian bitcoin proponents may get worrisome if the bill is approved by Governor Jim Justice due to the opinions of lawmakers within the state. For instance a few years ago the West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin wrote a letter to regulators asking for bitcoin to be banned. “The clear ends of Bitcoin for either transacting in illegal goods and services or speculative gambling make me wary of its use,” Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W. Va) wrote in his letter back then. “I urge the regulators to work together, act quickly, and prohibit this dangerous currency from harming hard-working Americans.” Many states are ramping up efforts to regulate bitcoin and gain some control over its use in regards to money laundering abuse. Some states are merely adding cryptocurrency to the state’s monetary instrument and taxation definitions, while other states like California are preparing business licensing legislation as well.      What do you think about West Virginia House Bill 2585?

Now a few regional news outlets are reporting that India’s government may be preparing to legalize and regulate bitcoin as a form of payment this summer. Also read: Markets Update: Bitcoin Price Rise Climbs to Uncharted Territory According to local news reports and India’s CNBC broadcast, Indian government officials are in the process of possibly giving bitcoin legal status. Just recently India’s parliamentary inter-ministerial committee held its first meeting to discuss bitcoin and virtual currency use in the country. Authorities have noticed the vast volumes of bitcoin being traded by Indian citizens lately. The Indian publication Money Control reported that a member of the committee stated bitcoin legality would soon be decided by the country’s officials. “There will be more discussions; a verdict will be declared soon on the legality of the cryptocurrency in India,” the committee spokesperson said. However, the source also told the publication if leaders decide to ban bitcoin then trading platforms operating in the region will be forced to close operations. During the parliamentary session, sources say quite a few officials had a positive outlook towards bitcoin while some disliked the cryptocurrency entirely. However, the beneficial attributes of bitcoin seemed to have swayed some members of the committee and lawmakers enough for them to consider amending the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Act. Furthermore, the committee also discussed the possibility of taxation methods towards virtual currencies. The inter-ministerial committee plans to reveal its research development during the end of May which could propose virtual currency legislation in the near future. The news follows this past February’s RBI statements towards bitcoin in a negative light. The central bank did not update the country’s Payment and Settlement Systems Act to include cryptocurrencies this year. However other local reports in the region state the RBI is watching the decentralized currency closely and gathering insight on its behavior. “As of now we are watching and learning about the developments of Bitcoin but are not regulating it,” a RBI spokeswoman explained. Alongside the parliamentary sessions, the Indian Ministry of Finance revealed on April 12 the creation of a government think tank dedicated to researching virtual currencies. The newly created committee plans to publish a report on cryptocurrencies in three months. Bitcoin businesses such as exchanges are doing quite well in the region, and Localbitcoins volumes continue to soar in India. Many bitcoin proponents hope Indian officials will recognize bitcoin in the same way Japan did on April 1. On the other hand, some of the country’s top officials like the Indian Parliament Member Kirit Somaiya may not agree with legislation that favors bitcoin legalization. Somaiya is one Indian official that has been very outspoken against Japan’s bitcoin legalization and he believes the cryptocurrency is a Ponzi.    Do you think India will legalize bitcoin as a payment like Japan did?

2017-04-28T12:44:39-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin Price Rise Climbs to Uncharted Territory,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoin-price-rise-unchartered-territory/,"The price of bitcoin has seen a spontaneous rise during the last week of April as the cryptocurrency’s fiat value has climbed to new highs. Over the course of the afternoon and evening of April 27 bitcoin’s price spiked to an all-time high of US$1360 across global exchanges.  Also read: Japanese City Accepts Bitcoin Donations Bitcoin markets are currently in an uncharted price territory as the digital asset once again surpassed its all-time high jumping in value 10 percent over the past 24 hours. The price has dipped a touch during the morning of April 28 as the global average on exchanges is roughly $1330 per BTC at press time. Bitcoin’s overall market capitalization is also higher than ever before as it currently captures a market share of $21.3 billion. Trading volume is also substantial as over $500 million worth of BTC has been traded daily over the past three days.  The weekly view and technical indicators suggest the bull run is not over but could see a hiccup in the short term. Bitcoin’s 100 Simple Moving Average SMA is still well above the 200 SMA trendline which means the ascending climb upwards may continue over the long term. With the Relative Strength Index (RSI) one can assume that buyers are still playing their cards and may continue to prop the price upwards. However, as we reported in our past three market updates the Stochastic indicator readout shows that sellers could pull the price down at any given time. Furthermore, market data from Bitfinex and traders on the trading forum Trading View show a lot more ‘short’ positions than ‘long’ positions. Overall cryptocurrency markets with altcoins included have also reached an all-time high of $33.6 billion USD at the time of writing. The second largest market capitalization held by Ethereum has skyrocketed to $5.7 billion over the past 24 hours. One ether is roughly $63, and Ethereum markets are trading a daily average of over $300 million in trade volume. The third runner-up Ripple (XRP) has seen a spike, as well, as the price has risen to over 4 cents per XRP. Litecoin (LTC) markets continue to do well, after the network  recently locked-in Segregated Witness activation. At the moment LTC is over $14 per token with a $750 million dollar market capitalization. Dash has seen an increase too as the price stayed stable at $70 over the past two weeks. The price per Dash is now $78 per coin seeing a 6 percent price increase over the past 24 hours. The other top ten cryptocurrency contenders are also seeing price rises, probably due to bitcoin’s ascending value. This includes price rises from Ethereum Classic ($4), NEM ($0.04), Monero ($21), Augur ($14), and Maidsafecoin ($0.23). Golem, Zcash, and PIVX are still trying to enter the top ten with 8-15 percent increases this week.  Bitcoin proponents seem happy with the price increase, but some people are skeptical due to seeing considerably higher price spreads between Bitfinex and other USD bitcoin exchanges. Mainstream media is giving bitcoin coverage because of the price spike and are attributing the increase to the SEC reviewing the Coin bitcoin ETF again. Other news outlets say that Japan’s recent bitcoin payment legalization law has also propelled the price upwards as well. Many are unsure of where the boost is coming from, and a lot of the uncertainty is stemming from the $100 difference between Bitfinex and the global average. Bear Scenario: Bitcoin’s fiat value has dipped during the early morning hours of April 28 since reaching its all-time high. A deeper correction could continue leading to prices below the $1300 mark. Order books across popular exchanges show current support looks very healthy in the $1250 per BTC price range. ‘Short’ positions are also starting to increase as the price has reached new territory. Bull Scenario: If bitcoin breaks current resistance the path upwards could easily trend past the $1400 range this week and even towards $1500. Buyers have control over the market and SMA and RSI technical indicators show the price ascent should continue. The current price territory is highly psychological, and there will be many breaks and scalps in between. Intra-range and day traders will likely find price sweet spots over the course of the next week. What do you think about Bitcoin’s price trends at the moment?

The ‘Parity Bitcoin’ client is written in Rust adding one more alternative implementation to the Bitcoin ecosystem.    Also read: There’s a Big Difference Between Electronic Fiat and Cryptocurrency The startup Parity Technologies is a blockchain-based firm led by the former Ethereum CTO and co-founder Gavin Wood. The company’s first product was the popular ‘Parity Ethereum,’ an ETH client that integrates into a browser. The team behind the new bitcoin client says the software was built from the ground up, with great attention to detail. The Parity Bitcoin client (Pbtc) is a full bitcoin node much like the existing software today, the only difference is the protocol is written in a different programming language. The Pbtc protocol stack can act as a wallet, verifying node, and also import Bitcoind among its many features using the command line. The computer hosting the Parity client also needs to install the Rustc 1.16.0 and Cargo software in order to use the new protocol with the Rust codebase.  Furthermore, the Parity Bitcoin software is open source licensed under GNU GPL and will enable other projects to either fork or build upon it further. The Rust codebase is also used widely among developers, being known for its ease of use and reliability. Zooko Wilcox-O’Hearn, the founder of Zcash, believes the Rust version of the Bitcoin software is great for decentralization. “Zcash is based on Bitcoin, and we’ve started using Rust, so we’re delighted to see a full Bitcoin implementation in Rust from a good team,” Wilcox-O’Hearn explained. “This kind of innovation helps move the whole ecosystem forward.” The project was initially funded by the mining pools Bitmain, Bixin, and F2Pool. The three company’s said during the announcement that a Rust version of Bitcoin is an excellent addition to the growing number of Bitcoin implementations. “The diversity and choice better represent the different participants in the ecosystem, allowing everyone to adopt a solution that works for them,” said the company’s joint statement. Parity Technologies is also developing its Polkadot software that aims to increase interoperability between multiple blockchains such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. Gavin Wood is thrilled to unveil the new Bitcoin implementation and is excited to see it foster development. Moreover Wood detailed he would love to see more collaboration between the Bitcoin developer community and alternative blockchain programmers. The new Bitcoin software comes at a time when alternative implementations are faced with scrutiny over the scaling debate. When asked if the project supported Segwit a Parity Bitcoin developer stated the software was currently neutral. “It does not commit to any previously discussed scaling approach, and neither favors Segwit nor increased block size. It’s a neutral release and pull requests are always welcome,” explained a Parity team member. What do you think about the Parity Bitcoin client? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

2017-04-27T09:30:01-04:00,Bitfinex Price Spreads Bring Uncertainty to Bitcoin’s Price Rally,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/uncertainty-surrounds-bitcoin-rally-bitfinex-price-spreads/,"One week has passed since bitcoin exchange Bitfinex announced issues with banking partners and halted fiat withdrawals for its customers. Since then the price of bitcoin has been rallying upwards reaching new highs across global exchanges. As the price surges, Bitfinex prices have been $100 higher than at other exchanges, making traders worrisome a bubble is forming.   Also read: SEC Approves Petition to Review Bitcoin ETF Rejection Everybody loves a good bull run, but this particular bitcoin price spike is being seen as unusual. The reason being one of the largest cryptocurrency exchanges has halted USD withdrawals and other fiat currencies until further notice. There was no adverse market reaction to the news, and Bitfinex prices began rising higher than every other exchange. At the time of writing the price per BTC on Bitfinex is $1405 but the price on Bitstamp is only $1306. This price spread has provoked fear and uncertainty among traders due to similar instances in the past. Traders don’t feel confident in the market because of the 2013 Mt Gox scandal which shook the bitcoin community to the core. For instance in September of 2013 Forbes columnist Donald Marron wrote an article that is eerily similar the current price spike called “How Bitcoin Spreads Violate a Fundamental Economic Law.” Marron notes that Mt Gox started having some price fluctuations when the exchange had issues with Wells Fargo and Dwolla. Price spreads began to happen slightly then picked up when Mt Gox suspended USD withdrawals. “Spreads briefly normalized until Mt Gox announced that it was suspending U.S. dollar withdrawals,” the author writes. Bitcoin.com spoke with Petar Zivkovski, COO at Whaleclub, the Hong Kong-based bitcoin trading platform, about the current market price trends. Zivkovski said he’s been getting together with many industry experts and insiders over the past few weeks, and the tone is generally bearish. “I personally believe we are entering a territory of greed when it comes to bitcoin prices,” Zivkovski tells Bitcoin.com. “We’ve seen less than 2% of positions come in the past 24 hours to short BTC/USD on Whaleclub. That means almost nobody out of millions of dollars in volume is betting against the currency.” The Whaleclub executive says figures show that fifty percent of Bitfinex’s cold wallets have been drained in the past couple of weeks due to customer withdrawals. “As a result, the books on Bitfinex have become even thinner, particularly on the ask side,” explains Zivkovski. “So when a customer comes in to buy BTC (at market, because of the urgency), they move the price upwards more easily. Which is why we’ve seen a perpetual price rise. This reminds me of the Mt Gox debacle, where price only kept going up, for the same reasons (blocked USD withdrawals).” There hasn’t been any word from Bitfinex since April 20 and traders are wondering what will happen if and when the exchange allows fiat withdrawals. Aside from that particular uncertainty, Zivkovski says insiders are still bearish even with the current spike. The network scaling quagmire has many people worried, especially since nobody has a solution that everyone can agree on, Zivkovski explains. “Once the exchange withdrawal issues get resolved, or a bearish event hits (such as an exchange liquidation), bitcoin’s price is likely to drop aggressively since it’s currently artificially inflated,” Zivkovski adds. What do you think about the current situation with Bitfinex and the price right now? Do you think things are artificially inflated? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-04-26T19:00:09-04:00,Overstock’s Medici and Ripio to Bring Bitcoin Financial Services to Emerging Markets,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/overstock-medici-ripio-bitcoin-financial-services-emerging-markets/,"Overstock’s blockchain technology arm, Medici Ventures, has partnered with Bitcoin consumer financial services platform Ripio to democratize access to financial services in emerging markets. Also read: Mexico’s New Bill Could Be a Game Changer for Bitcoin Medici Ventures, a wholly owned subsidiary of Overstock.com Inc., announced on Wednesday that it has invested in Bitcoin consumer financial services platform Ripio. “We are super excited to partner with Medici Ventures team,” said Sebastian Serrano, CEO and co-founder of Ripio, adding that: Commenting on the partnership, the president of Medici Ventures, Jonathan Johnson, explained that Ripio has “the type of life-changing application of blockchain technology” his firm is interested in. He cited the startup’s simplified peer-to-peer payment system “that is accessible to anyone with a smartphone, no matter his or her level of technical sophistication.” As part of the partnership, Medici Ventures will also “take an observer’s seat in Ripio’s board of directors meetings.” Launched in 2014 by Bitpagos, a bitcoin payment processor focussed in Latin America and emerging markets, Ripio claims to have more than 70,000 users across Argentina and Brazil. In addition, the company is in the process of expanding to other countries in the region, including Mexico and Colombia. The startup offers a suite of Bitcoin financial services, such as buying and selling bitcoins in local currencies and making online payments at thousands of websites and stores. According to the company: In January, Ripio raised USD$1.9 million to promote financial inclusion in South America using Bitcoin. The startup revealed at the time its plan to use the new funding to expand services into Brazil and Mexico. Initially, the company will be offering its wallet service, but will later add a consumer credit system as well. In May, the company launched a credit system in Argentina called “Ripio Credit” on top of its wallet offering. It allows people who are unbanked or without a credit card to make purchases online. Using the blockchain, the startup “created a payment system that enables users to buy goods online without the need for a credit card, or credit check,” Techcrunch reported, noting that for this service “no actual bitcoin is involved for either merchant or buyer.” Once consumers apply for the card, it takes the company about a day to check the consumer for credit, the publication details, adding that “those that use the Bitpagos’ bitcoin wallet can be approved instantly because they have a payment history.” Ripio’s website states that its credit system allows users to “pay in installments in any store accepting bitcoin.” What do you think of the partnership between Medici Ventures and Ripio?

2017-04-26T16:04:59-04:00,Wikipediaâs Jimmy Walesâ News Project to Pay Journalists in Bitcoin,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/wikipedias-jimmy-wales-news-project-to-pay-journalists-in-bitcoin/,"The founder of Wikipedia, Jimmy Wales, has a lot ofÂ respect for the Bitcoin community. On April 25, he published a Reddit post describing a news project he envisioned called Wikitribune. In the post, he showered the Bitcoin community with praise, saying how much generosity the group demonstrated before and after Wikipedia started accepting Bitcoin donations. He alsoÂ used an example of Bitcoin in regards to the kind of reporters he wants to recruitÂ for his Wikitribune project.Â  Also read: Bitcoinâs Triumphant Q1 Price Resilience and Performance Surpassed All Fiat Currencies He said, “At my new project Wikitribune I am going with a no-paywallÂ “monthlyÂ supporter” model but I wanted to also reach out directly to you so you’ll know that I’m particularly thinking of this community as a great example of how lots of things are underserved by traditional media models.” It comes as no surprise that Wales has so much respect and dignity for the community.Â He has a strong bond with bitcoiners. He started toying with the digital currency back in 2014, when in march of that year he tweeted he was “playing with BTC.” In the comment section of the tweet he postedÂ his BTC address. He received 5 BTC worth of unsolicited donations. Those generous donations had an impact on Wales. On April 11, 2014, he tweeted he would make a recommendation to theÂ Wikipedia board for a “light implementation” of the currency for donation acceptance.  Not a full month later, heÂ signed up for a Coinbase account and posted his experience onÂ Reddit, where he mentioned he was a “newbie” and mightÂ have questions. The BitcoinÂ community reacted with pride and a genuine desire to help. Many people, including Rees from Coinbase, took the time to answer questions andÂ warmly welcome him into the world of crypto. Then on July 30, 2014, the Wikimedia Foundation (which includes Wikipedia) released a blog postÂ saying they nowÂ accept Bitcoin donations. The post mentioned they discoveredÂ ways to overcome legal hurdles and that they achieved this by partnering with Coinbase. The announcement states;  Wales’ experience with Bitcoin and the community is what drove him to praise everyone inÂ the space. It galvanized his initiative to involve Bitcoin reporters in his project. Wales said he plans for Wikitribune to be a neutral media reporting site, where journalists are paid entirely in the form of donations. However, he mentioned the project is divorced from the Wikimedia foundation or Wikipedia-based projects. It is a standalone gig, meant to keep news writing as an objective practice. He specified that roughly 50% of the contributions will go to journalist salaries with the rest going to overhead and other fees. He said because he is so fond of the bitcoin community, he is pledging to use 100% of the contributions that arrive at the Wikitribune donation address to hire high quality neutral reporters for the bitcoin/blockchain beat. How does Wales’ praise of the bitcoin community make you feel? Do you think the Wikitribune project idea is good? Â Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-04-26T11:37:38-04:00,Bitcoin’s Triumphant Q1 Price Resilience and Performance Surpassed All Fiat Currencies,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-triumphant-q1-price-resilience-performance/,"The price of bitcoin is once again steadily rising towards the US$1300 range and currently outperforming the price of one ounce of gold. The first quarter of 2017 has shown bitcoin’s market resilience is stronger than it’s ever been before. Also Read: Brexit and Bitcoin and Gold, Oh My! The first four months of 2017 has been exciting for bitcoin market participants as the price per BTC has had an incredible run. At press time the price per bitcoin is around $1290, and the decentralized cryptocurrency currently commands a $20 billion market capitalization. On April 25 one bitcoin outperformed the spot price of gold as it had done already a few weeks ago. Furthermore, as a currency bitcoin is also surpassing every government-issued fiat currency performance-wise as well. Even though bitcoin markets have been on a tear, the rise has been rather modest. As far as other cryptocurrencies are concerned, altcoins like Ethereum, Dash, and Monero, performed even better than bitcoin’s 30 percent Q1 gains. For instance, Dash increased in price by over 800 percent and Ethereum’s market valuation jumped ahead by 600 percent. However, many of the pumping altcoins have yet to see any real world use cases outside of cryptocurrency market pumps and dumps. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is seeing a lot of demand from quite a few specific countries including Russia, India, China, Venezuela, Japan and more. Bitcoin volumes for all of these countries have seen exponential surges, most notably on the Localbitcoins platform. Rumors of both Indian and Chinese governments planning to legalize and regulate bitcoin proliferate. Meanwhile, on April 1 Japan’s government legalized bitcoin as a form of payment and the country will soon see increased merchant adoption. Many Bitcoin proponents were hoping for the approval of a bitcoin Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) this year. However, on March 10 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected the bitcoin ETF. Instead of seeing a significant price decline bitcoin markets have continued to rally after the ETF rejection. Moreover, SEC has revealed it will be once again reviewing the ETF, and could change its stance in the future. “Pursuant to Rule 431 of the Rules of Practice, 11 BZX’s petition for review of the Disapproval Order is granted,” explains the U.S. regulatory agency. Above and beyond all of the worldwide demand, bitcoin markets have stayed resilient throughout the controversial scaling debate as well. Every single day the drama surrounding the debate has been quite hectic, to say the least, but all things considered the price hasn’t been affected. The decentralized currency continues to march against the US dollar considerably as it approaches the $1300 range. For now, bulls are currently dominating the market as many speculators consider the plethora of reasons for the spike such as Japan, the ETF review, and overall global demand driving the bitcoin rally. Really no one can pinpoint the exact reason why bitcoin is performing so well, but not many people are complaining about the rise. What do you think about bitcoin’s Q1 performance this year?

2017-04-26T07:00:34-04:00,The Tech to Timestamp Data in Bitcoin’s Blockchain Has Evolved Far Past Single-File Uploads,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-tech-to-timestamp-data-in-bitcoins-blockchain-has-evolved-far-past-single-file-uploads/,"Using Bitcoin’s blockchain to timestamp data has evolved far past single-file uploads that have users pay a Bitcoin network fee. Full-featured APIs and platforms like Opentimestamps are free, open source protocols which allow a wide range of applications to be built on top of them. Also read: Bitcoin’s Blockchain Timestamping Standards Face Off Opentimestamps has been offering a robust, yet free protocol that allows anyone to build Blockchain timestamping into their service since 2012. At least four companies are currently using this protocol. Stampery, Block Notary, Eternity Wall, and Verisart all use it at the core of their businesses today. Bitcoin.com spoke with Opentimestamps creator Peter Todd about what’s new with this tool, how it works, and his future plans for it. Peter Todd (PT): As the name suggests, it’s a truly open timestamping system. Essentially, a cryptographic timestamp simply proves that data existed at some point in time. That’s useful in a wide variety of situations ranging from preventing tampering of logs, validating digital signatures, authenticating art, etc. The reason why timestamps are useful is because if you can prove that data was created in the past, often that lets you rule out a whole variety of attacks. It’s like carbon dating an artwork: if you can prove the artwork was created 300 years ago, while it may still be a forgery created 300 years ago, you can rule out it being a forgery created recently. PT: Unlike previous timestamping solutions, Opentimestamps is open and efficient. What that means is an Opentimestamps proof is a sequence of math operations that prove a timestamp. On top of that proof scheme, we provide free and open source calendar servers to the public, as a non-profit public service. They do two things: 1. Aggregation: They make Merkle trees of timestamp requests and timestamp them in Bitcoin.
2. Calendars: They promise to keep those timestamps and make them available to the public. So tl;dr: Opentimestamps lets you both create your timestamp for free, and unlike other Bitcoin-based solutions, you can create a timestamp almost instantly. This is really important for applications like signing emails and git commits where you don’t want to wait for a confirmation in the blockchain. PT: Note that timestamps aren’t “saved” to the Bitcoin blockchain, they’re *committed* by the Bitcoin blockchain. However, Ethereum though isn’t very interesting: it’s the same basic trust model as Bitcoin, and the time resolution isn’t any better either. Fundamentally you can’t reliably get better than a few hours precision out of a decentralized timestamping scheme, because you can’t rely on miners getting their clocks right – systems like Ethereum that try to do that just make themselves vulnerable to consensus failures due to clock skew. What I am excited about is combining trusted timestamping like Roughtime [Google’s secure synchronization protocol] with decentralized Bitcoin timestamping. That can get you precision to within a second or two, with the decentralized Bitcoin timestamping protecting against dishonesty and key compromise. PT: From a cryptography and security point of view, we’re very confident that the Opentimestamps protocol is secure, and it has had a lot of peer review; from that point of view, it’s on the same level as Bitcoin itself in terms of being production ready. Equally, if you’re a business with staff that understand how timestamping crypto works and can read the Opentimestamps source code, I think you should feel confident in using Opentimestamps in production: if something went wrong, you’ve got the skillset to fix it quickly and get your business up and running again. Timestamping is *not* difficult crypto, so I think most “blockchain” companies will have that kind of talent on hand; I’ve put a lot of effort into making sure the Opentimestamps protocol is simple and easy to understand and implement, even if you’re not a crypto expert. It’s listed as alpha software simply because if you *don’t* have that skillset, there’s still a lot of rough edges to Opentimestamps in things like documentation, API stability, etc. So if your business is depending on Opentimestamps, it might take longer to get a problem fixed than it should for you. PT: It’s difficult to know for sure, but I’d make a very rough guess at high hundreds to low thousands. PT: We’re just paying for it out of pocket. Quite simply, the Opentimestamps protocol is extremely efficient, so the cost to run the servers is trivial. Equally, because Opentimestamps is a trustless protocol, if high load ever were a problem it’d be very easy to accept donations of server space from anyone who wanted to support the effort. I just checked, and a single visit to the Opentimestamps.org website uses hundreds of times more bandwidth than it takes to create a timestamp; the actual bandwidth cost I’m paying for one of the servers per timestamp is literally a millionth of a penny. Finally… remember that you don’t need us to use Opentimestamps! The public calendar servers are for efficiency and convenience; the code they run on is completely open source and I encourage any business using Opentimestamps for business critical use-cases to know how to run their own. PT: Quite simply, Opentimestamps fixed that problem because it scales: any number of timestamps can be created with a single transaction, and it has the infrastructure in place to do exactly that in production, for free. PT: Monetizing the creation of timestamps is just silly: Opentimestamps proves that timestamping protocols can be made to be so efficient as to have almost unmeasurably low costs per timestamp. Opentimestamps is the standard free software/public infrastructure story: I’m getting paid to work on it because I have clients who need it to exist too. Similarly, there are a few developers from a few companies contributing to development, again because they need it to exist too. And none of us want to risk getting locked into the proprietary or pseudo-free solutions that have plagued timestamping. PT: 1. Calendar mirroring and other infrastructure to ensure that they aren’t a single-point-of-failure and are resilient to attack (already partly implemented).
2. High-precision, (+-1 second) timestamps with the Roughtime protocol.
3. Better libraries with more languages (e.g. Andrew Poelstra’s new Rust library). Would you use Opentimestamps? Let us know in the comments section below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Opentimestamps, Ethereum, and Peter Todd Need to calculate your bitcoin holdings? Check our tools section."

The exchange then filed a petition for a review of the Commission’s decision, which was granted on Monday. Also read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF Following the SEC’s decision to disapprove its proposed rule change for the listing and trading of Coin ETF, Bats BZX Exchange quickly filed a “Notice of Intention to Petition for Review” of the Commission’s decision on March 17. It then followed up with the actual “Petition for Review” on March 24. The order to reject Coin ETF was made by the SEC’s “Division of Trading and Markets pursuant to delegated authority”. The exchange followed procedures outlined in Rule 430(b)(1) and 430(b)(2) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice which allow for an “appeal of actions made pursuant to delegated authority”. After one month, the SEC finally approved Bats BZX Exchange’s petition. The “Order Granting Petition for Review” was published on Monday. The Commission wrote: In addition, the SEC is allowing anyone to file a statement to support or oppose the decision made by delegated authority on or before May 15. Meanwhile, the “order disapproving such proposed rule change shall remain in effect,” the Commission wrote. In its 25-page petition for a review, Bats Exchange states that the decision by the delegated authority “is clearly erroneous”. The exchange claims that the standard applied in their disapproval decision “is inconsistent with prior approval orders” and is not even required by the Securities Exchange Act. The delegated authority has also overstated manipulation concerns which are largely theoretical, Bats Exchange believes. It then urges the Commission to review their decision, citing its proposed rule change and that the listing of a Bitcoin ETF “constitute an exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is important and that the Commission should review.” In addition, the exchange maintains that its proposed rule change is “consistent with the Exchange Act under a standard applied to other approved commodity-trust ETPs [Exchange Traded Products].” Bats Exchange then concluded that: Meanwhile, the SEC has also rejected the proposed rule change by NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of Solidx Bitcoin Trust. However, unlike Bats BZX Exchange, NYSE Arca did not petition for a review. The SEC still has one more proposed rule change for a bitcoin ETF in the pipeline, Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust. On March 25, the Commission designated May 10 as the date it would make a decision on this proposed rule change; a deadline that could be extended further.

The South Korean bank has just published a research paper that compares cryptocurrencies to traditional fiat currencies issued by governments. Also read: Korea Steadily Becoming a Cryptocurrency and Fintech Hub  Researchers from Seoul’s Hongik University and members of the Bank of Korea (BOK) have released a paper called “Crowding out in a Dual Currency Regime.” The paper written by Kihoon Hong, Kyounghoon Park, and Jongmin Yu details how cryptocurrencies and fiat monetary systems could collaborate in the future in what the authors call a “dual currency regime.”   “The rise of cryptocurrencies could have a significant impact on our monetary system as they are privately issued currencies, thus not regulated by central banks,” explains the BOK research paper’s authors. In essence, the report states that traditional fiat systems can coexist with privately issued digital currencies like bitcoin. The paper reports that the relationship between the use of fiat currency and that of digital currency demand can change with cost variances. “High costs of using fiat currency increase the demand for digital currency,” details the BOK research paper. “Similarly, high costs of using digital currency relative to fiat currency raise the demand for fiat currency. In a world of imperfect currencies with uncertain costs associated with the use of a currency, it is unlikely that the relative costs of using digital currency will be low enough to drive out and accordingly crowd out fiat currency entirely.” Bitcoin has made a significant impact in South Korea as the country captures the fifth-highest bitcoin trading volume worldwide. Last November the Korea Exchange launched its blockchain-based Korea Startup Market (KSM) while the Korean Financial Services Commission (FSC) has talked about regulating  bitcoin this year. The latest research paper from the BOK reveals the country’s officials are very interested in cryptocurrencies. The authors say they hope the research provided will help South Korean officials and regulators understand the new technology. The paper goes on to state that future research can theoretically and empirically observe the impact of digital currencies and the South Korean economy. Alongside this, the central bank’s researchers say they may work on a paper that covers three types of coexisting currencies in the near future. “Further, we may attempt to extend our model to a triple currency regime with private-issued digital currency, central-bank-issued digital currency, and fiat currency,” the paper concludes.

2017-04-25T03:00:51-04:00,‘Rectification Plan’ for Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges Leaked,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/rectification-plan-chinese-bitcoin-exchanges-leaked/,"On Monday, Chinese publication 8Btc posted a translation of a document that contained supposedly leaked “rectification guidelines” for bitcoin exchanges. “It’s the first time the document that’s given rise to the regulatory storm on bitcoin exchanges was exposed to the public,” according to the publication. Also read: Major Chinese Exchanges to Postpone the Return of Withdrawals The State Council is the chief administrative authority of China, chaired by the Premier and includes the heads of each governmental department and agency. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is one of the 35 departments and agencies constituting the State Council. On October 13, 2016, the State Council released to the public “the Plan to Implement Special Rectification Work on Internet Finance Risks.” The leaked document references the October implementation plan by the State Council (No. 21) as well as a notice by the PBOC and 17 other ministries (No. 281) published in December last year. It then states that: The leaked document has 10 sections. The images of the original document can be found on Hexun.com, one of China’s largest financial information portals. They were reportedly first posted by a Wechat user. “This guideline applies to all bitcoin trading platforms that are found across the country,” the first part of the document reads. It continues: If the leaked document is authentic, local regulators are supposed to take the lead in the rectification work, with the help of the local branch of the People’s Bank. They are to perform on-site inspections, put forward recommendations, and submit progress reports regularly. Depending on the outcome of the inspection, bitcoin exchanges may be required to stop fiat and bitcoin lending businesses; charge transaction fees; suspend bitcoin withdrawals; establish a sound anti-money laundering system; and conduct business in line with legal requirements. “The document confirms that the suspension of bitcoin withdrawals is a direct order from the authority,” 8Btc inferred. Regular progress reports include details of “the basic situation of the trading platform, issues found in the preliminary investigation, issues to be further identified, an action plan for future rectification, rectification summary of exchanges within the jurisdiction,” the publication translates. A section in the leaked document is dedicated to rules that bitcoin exchanges must follow. In March, Bitcoin.com reported on a similar list of prohibited items imposed on bitcoin exchanges, published by Caixin publication. Below is the new set of rules outlined in the leaked document. 1. Do not engage in fiat and bitcoin lending.
2. Transaction fees must not be zero.
3. Do not engage in money laundry.
4. Do not violate relevant regulatory requirements on foreign exchange management.
5. Do not engage in illegal payment business.
6. Do not engage in business operation beyond the scope stated on the business license.
7. Do not violate industrial and commercial advertising and other laws and regulations.
8. Do not violate laws and regulations of national securities and futures. In addition, the guidelines detail some areas which bitcoin exchanges are inspected. For each exchange platform, the inspector must check several key areas and any other items that may come up. Some of them are outlined below. First, the exchange’s basic business information needs to be verified, including its registered capital, operating entity, shareholder structure, and related businesses. Second, specific details of its operations need to be disclosed, including the amount of deposit and withdrawal from 2016 to present date of 2017, the amount and quantity of transactions, rates and fees and its bitcoin trading model. Third, the inspector must determine whether the exchange has violated any relevant provisions as an exchange platform such as the use of standardized contracts and whether the order book is matched electronically. Fourth, it must be determined if the exchange is engaged in illegal financial businesses such as offering margin loans, futures trading, payment, exchange and other services without authorization. Fifth, the inspector must determine if the exchange has a sound anti-money laundering system. This includes establishing customer identity information and transaction record storage system as well as establishing a system for reporting on large and suspicious transactions. In addition, the inspector must also verify the exchange’s procedure regarding customers’ funds including determining the balance of the funds, the use of the funds, and the establishment of a third-party custody system. While the inspections may be exhaustive and the requirements extensive, the necessary work may already be done. According to the China Banking Regulatory Commission, the rectification work “is planned to be finished in March 2017,” the Commission said when the implementation plan was released in October last year.

2017-04-24T17:00:07-04:00,The Backpage Effect: Why the Sex Industry Thrives on Bitcoin,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/backpage-effect-sex-industry-thrives-bitcoin/,"Backpage.com is a website like Craigslist, although it is more scandalous and provocative. The site was well-known for allowing sex workers to post solicitations. In 2015, the site was alleged to be permitting prostitution and propping up a sex trafficking ring involving youths. These charges were never validated, but the fallout caused a shift in the way the peaceful sex industry uses money and does business. Bitcoin is now one of the main forms of currency fueling this enterprise. So how did this happen?  Also read: Research Shows How Bitcoin Can Be Attacked Via Internet Routing Infrastructure Following a several months of alleged Backpage solicitations, the U.S. government got a whiff of this supposed illegal activity. The government claimed they found evidence of a child sex trafficking conspiracy. They immediately took legal action against the website. They arrested the CEO and other executives, and leveled charges of pimping. After an ongoing legal battle, the charges were eventually dropped. The judge said, “Congress has precluded liability for online publishers for the action of publishing third party speech and thus provided for both a foreclosure from prosecution and an affirmative defense at trial. Congress has spoken on this matter, and it is for Congress, not this Court, to revisit.” For anyone unfamiliar, this occurrence is reminiscent of Ross Ulbricht’s story. Ulbricht supposedly ran the underground market called The Silk Road. He was condemned as the “Dread Pirate Roberts” and given two consecutive life sentences, because people on the website allegedly sold drugs and other contraband. Why was Ulbricht sentenced and the Backpage CEO’s charges dismissed? This act was believed by many to be a grave miscarriage of justice. Needless to say, the “adult” section of Backpage was promptly removed by the company, because they could not combat the State’s extralegal action against them. For clarification, Backpage removed their adult section not because of any wrongdoing, but because government agencies kept bullying and harassing them. It is obvious the voluntary sex workers still use the page under the dating section, but that is part of a broader, evolving story.  Adding insult to injury, MasterCard and Visa shut down transactions on Backpage.com. It appears they also cancel many transactions that have anything remotely to do with the industry. The credit card companies did this because they fear getting tied up in child pornography or trafficking, especially in the United States. A Motherboard article verified this move: This action caused a ripple effect. Countries, where prostitution is legal, felt the repercussions. This was especially true in Australia. The actions of government, as well as major credit card’s rejecting transactions, caused sex workers to migrate underground and embrace the counter-economy. This underground railroad of workers has brought with it a chain of negative repercussions. Sex workers and prostitutes now rely on roaming the streets, discovering pimps, risking their life with random clients, or taking their chances using the dark web to promote their business. When they had more direct and public access to their clientele online, there was less risk involved. In response to government and central credit card holders thwarting their business, sex workers have also turned to Bitcoin to fund their activities. This consequence of government action on the sex trade has been referred to as the Backpage Effect. The Backpage effect posits that after Backpage solicitation was thwarted, all workers returned to the streets—or more furtive online markets—armed with Bitcoin to fuel their licentious enterprise. Even though sex workers have had to submit themselves to working the streets and or secretive online markets, bitcoin has helped conceal their activities. It is true that bitcoin is not fully anonymous, but it has allowed for quasi-concealed payments in the sex trade. It has indeed helped protect the sex workers and maintain some semblance of privacy. Additionally, credit card industries have also affected the legal sex conglomerates in the U.S. These industries have also started using Bitcoin. For example, the adult firm Naughty America has teamed up with Descent in order to make transactions much easier with less legal risk. The industries have turned to cryptocurrency, namely bitcoin, because it is not centrally controlled, and a central institution like a creditor cannot shut down the transactions. The sex business retains control over their funds regardless. A Breitbart article said, There has not been a lot of developments in the industry as of late, but we do know the Backpage effect has altered all facets of the sex trade. It has caused Bitcoin to become a force in the sensual markets. Many acts of prostitution or underground lovemaking occurs through channels within cyberspace, helping to curb violence and prevent sex workers from possibly having their money stolen. Some workers said they even prefer digital coins to cash, because trading cash after a romp in the sheets seems “dirty.” Thenextweb.com publication captured a sex worker make this comment back in a 2014 article. The worker said, “It would make me a lot more comfortable if they took any form of cryptocurrency that is semi-anonymous. It feels dirty passing cash at the end of our time together.” Not to mention, the semi-anonymous nature of Bitcoin keeps most sex workers safe from law enforcement. In an economic ecosystem where governments crush businesses that leverage online resources that make the sex industry safer, the natural fallout is for escorts and prostitutes to scamper underground and use new methods of payment. Cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin, has thus become a staple. It will likely remain this way, even if websites like Backpage are allowed to return to business. Matter of fact, things would probably improve even more for sex workers. They would be able to keep their affairs public and use bitcoin. This would greatly reduce harm to the escorts and prostitutes involved in this trade. What do you think the future of the sex industry looks like? Let us know in the comments below.  Images courtesy of Shutterstock and Backpage.com Bitcoin is cool, and you know everyone wants in – even the ones who say they don’t.

2017-04-24T12:00:56-04:00,The Great Price Divide Widens During Bitcoin’s 2017 Rise,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/great-price-divide-widens-bitcoins-2017-rise/,"Over the course of the past week, many traders have been discussing the significant price differences between exchanges. Most notably, the spread between Bitfinex and a majority of other exchanges’ rates is considerable. Also read: The One Man Supreme Court Bitlicense Battle Begins in Two Weeks The price difference at Bitfinex compared to other exchanges is roughly $110 at press time. The large spread has been ongoing for the past five days and began when the exchange halted fiat withdrawals. The price difference and suspended withdrawals have quite a few skeptics concerned the community could once again revisit the bad memories of the Mt Gox fiasco in the past. During the beginning of the bull run in 2013 and throughout the cryptocurrency’s all time highs that year price spreads began to vary. The biggest price difference was represented on the now defunct bitcoin exchange Mt Gox and started around August of 2013. During this time warnings of insolvency had begun to reach the ears of the community and many people believed the price differences were a bad omen. Economist and author Konrad S. Graf wrote about the subject at the time in a piece called “A banking risk premium: Mt. Gox XBT/USD spread over Bitstamp.” When the difference occurred, Graf noticed Mt Gox users were having difficulties, particularly with USD withdrawals.  “According to user reports, whereas Bitstamp reliably and promptly processes both deposits and withdrawals of fiat currencies, Mt. Gox’s ability to do so, particularly with regard to US dollars, has become highly unreliable in the eyes of more and more market participants,” explains Graf on August 21, 2013.  Exchanges currently having problems process fiat withdrawals is one factor being attributed to this April’s spike and price spread variances. A key difference between now and 2013 was the use of a Mt Gox trading bot called “Willy.” The infamous bot was spotted in September of 2013 but really caught attention the following December. That December bitcoin hit an all-time price high across global exchanges with noticeable price differences between Mt Gox and others. In an expose called “The Willy Report,” a few bitcoin proponents noticed peculiar activity at Mt Gox. It was then discovered that two trading bots called Willy and Markus were actively driving up the premium of bitcoin on Mt Gox on a regular basis since September 27, 2013. According to the researchers of the report, the Willy account continued to trade on Mt Gox until January of that year.   There doesn’t seem to be any evidence that Bitfinex is suffering from the same exploits as Mt Gox did in the past. In fact, the exchange has vehemently denied insolvency and has explained that other trading platforms are dealing with the same banking hardships. “We want to apologize again for this continuing inconvenience, and to assure our customers that we are doing everything to get back to normal operations,” Bitfinex has explained to its clients. Another interesting factor is the price difference between the cryptocurrency exchange Poloniex and other exchanges. At press time one bitcoin is 1331 USDT on the Poloniex trading platform but most people don’t realize USDT stands for the digital currency Tether. Poloniex doesn’t use fiat on its website so instead it uses Tether, a digital asset that’s supposed to be backed by one U.S. dollar on a 1-to-1 ratio. Since the withdrawal issues started at Bitfinex, BTC-e and other exchanges, the cryptocurrency Tether has dipped in price under the $1 mark.  At present, one Tether is priced at 0.91 cents and that is the reason why the price per BTC on Poloniex looks so much higher, but it’s really not. A recent blog post by entrepreneur Jimi Smoot describes the situation quite well and he believes Tether’s own fiat wire capabilities have also been suspended. “As of this writing, however, Tether and Bitfinex are both having issues sending and receiving wire transfers in US dollars,” explains Smoot. “You wouldn’t know this by looking at the Tether twitter/website/etc but guess who does know — The market knows. Regardless, it seems that the market believes that Tether has become slightly less Tethered. I wonder how much more the price will slide each day that the wire capabilities are down.” Whatever the case may be, people find the price spreads odd, but some think there are arbitrage opportunities. Arbitrage is buying from one exchange at a lower price and selling at a premium at the exchange with higher prices and profiting from the difference. There are many posts on social media that discuss the Bitfinex arbitrage ‘opportunity’ giving step by step walkthroughs on the procedure. However, some believe using the opportunity to profit may be risky at an exchange suffering from fiat withdrawal issues, as skeptics say other types of withdrawal suspensions could follow. Just as people were worrisome about the price spreads in 2013 the same could be said today, as people tend to agree right now, that $100 price spreads are not usual occurrences and should cause skepticism.

2017-04-24T03:30:55-04:00,Moonbeam Could Allow Bitcoin to Scale Within Weeks,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/moonbeam-bitcoin-scale/,"Moonbeam is an open source protocol that uses Bitcoin payment channels to facilitate instant, off-chain payments between multi-user platforms. “Moonbeam doesn’t require Segwit or larger blocks, and can be deployed on the Bitcoin network today,” according to the project page on Github. Bitcoin.com spoke with Timothy Stranex, CTO at bitcoin exchange Luno and lead developer of the Moonbeam project. Also read: Why ‘Billionaire’ Novogratz Holds 10% of His Wealth in Bitcoin and Ether A new solution to Bitcoin’s scaling problems Moonbeam uses Satoshi Nakamoto’s idea of payment channels in a more direct and simple way than other layer-two solutions. Like a single-direction Lightning Network, Moonbeam moves certain transactions off-chain, and could enable far more of them between high-volume platforms like Bitcoin exchanges and wallet providers. The new project could help scale Bitcoin without the need for Bitcoin’s developers to do anything at all, including raising the block size or implementing Segwit. Timothy Stranex (TS): Normally when you send a Bitcoin payment, you create a new unique Bitcoin transaction and pay a fee to miners to include it in a block. The miner fee is only paid once for the settlement transaction, even if the batch contains a thousand payments. Despite this batching behavior, the individual payments can be sent instantly with no need to wait for confirmations. This batching method is known as “payment channels”. Moonbeam is a protocol that uses the payment channel concept and other techniques to form a practical system. TS: Moonbeam is an open source protocol – it’s not a product as such from Luno, but it’s something that we want to use within our products. At Luno, we used to cover the Bitcoin network fees for our customers but with fees increasing so rapidly over recent months, we and many other companies, have had to start charging network fees to customers. This project grew out of the frustration from that. We want to give our customers faster Bitcoin payments with lower costs, and Moonbeam seems to be the most practical way to achieve this in the short term. TS: My goal with Moonbeam is to offer a way for Bitcoin platforms to process faster payments with lower costs that can be deployed on Bitcoin as it exists today. It seems that changes to Bitcoin itself have become deadlocked and it may take many months or years to make progress on that front. So, for the short term, it’s better to build solutions that don’t require changes to Bitcoin itself. TS: A Moonbeam address looks like this: mgzdqkEjYEjR5QNdJxYFnCKZHuNYa5bUZ2+mb7vCiK@example.com The first component is just a normal Bitcoin address. Wallets that don’t yet support Moonbeam can just cut off everything, past the + symbol, and treat it as a normal Bitcoin address. Wallets that do support Moonbeam can use the whole address and send the payment more efficiently via a Moonbeam channel. The key point here is that from the end user’s perspective, they can use addresses with both old and new software. Wallets that do support Moonbeam can use the whole address and send the payment more efficiently via a Moonbeam channel. The key point here is that from the end user’s perspective, they can use addresses with both old and new software. TS: Users don’t need to worry about finding channels – it’s handled transparently by their wallet platform. Users will just instruct their wallet to send a payment to the Moonbeam address (e.g. mgzdqkEjYEjR5QNdJxYFnCKZHuNYa5bUZ2+mb7vCiK@example.com). Their wallet platform will send it via a channel already open to example.com, if there is one, or via a normal Bitcoin transaction to the Bitcoin address. Moonbeam is designed primarily for multi-user platforms. You normally wouldn’t operate a Moonbeam channel by yourself as an individual. TS: In Moonbeam, we use DNS to route payments to domains, very similar to how email routing works. This is quite a neat solution because it means we don’t have to re-invent a new routing system; DNS is already battle tested and has been operating well on the internet for many years. Nevertheless, DNS alone is vulnerable to spoofing attacks. Moonbeam uses SSL certificates to protect against domain name spoofing and man-in-the-middle attacks, the same way HTTPS websites are secured in your web browser. We’re also working on adding protection for some more sophisticated attacks like domain hijacking. TS: We’ve already released a reference implementation which works both on production and testnet. TS: Wallet interfaces will appear almost identical to those today. The wallet will just be able to accept either a normal Bitcoin address or a Moonbeam address as the payment destination. Most of the changes will be behind the scenes. TS: Given that blocks are already saturated, and that Bitcoin usage is growing in general, I don’t expect Moonbeam to affect these on-chain metrics.

2017-04-23T18:00:50-04:00,New Florida Virtual Currency Bill to Target Bitcoin Money Laundering,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/new-florida-virtual-currency-bill-to-target-bitcoin-money-laundering/,"Florida lawmakers are considering new legislation that aims to stop virtual currency dealers who participate in money laundering. The bill, sponsored by Miami-Dade Representative Jose Felix Diaz, has passed through the state’s House Appropriations Committee. Also read: The One Man Supreme Court Bitlicense Battle Begins in Two Weeks Monetary concealment and cryptocurrency is the latest topic for Florida legislators following the state’s money laundering lawsuit dismissal last year. The case involved Michel Espinoza, a man charged with illegal money transmission for selling $1,500 worth of bitcoins to undercover police. Espinoza’s case was dismissed because the judge considered bitcoins as a form of property. Miami-Dade officials are not pleased with the result of the Espinoza trial, and the state is appealing the judge’s decision.    Now a bill sponsored by local bureaucrats and the Miami-Dade Cyber Crime Unit will define bitcoin as a “monetary instrument” and criminals using “virtual currencies” can be prosecuted for money laundering charges. “The high-tech criminals of the 21st Century use virtual currencies like bitcoin to accumulate and hide the profits of their illegal activities,” explained Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle. If the law passes, it will essentially add bitcoin to the current definitions of “monetary instruments” under Florida’s money laundering act. Current Florida statutes say “monetary instruments” are defined as coin, U.S. or foreign currency, and checks. Bitcoin and other virtual currencies do not fall into that category and that is the reason why the Miami-Dade judge dismissed the Espinoza case. Each U.S. state is trying to figure out whether or not bitcoin is considered a currency or commodity. Currently, there is no general consensus on which definition to use, and this has made legal issues difficult. For instance, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) defines bitcoin as a commodity or property. But in September of 2016, a federal judge based out of Manhattan declared bitcoin is money during a high-profile New York lawsuit. In the New York criminal case against Anthony Murgio, Federal Judge Alison Nathan stated: A South Florida-based attorney, Andrew Hinkes, says the new bill will not give prosecutors an advantage as they will still need to prove money laundering intent. “I don’t think it would affect the day-to-day users of bitcoin, or investors who hold bitcoin,” Hinkes explains to the Miami Herald. “But it might affect the business of those who exchange bitcoin for dollars. Now, assuming the facts support the intent required by law, the path to the prosecution of traders for money laundering is clearer in Florida.” The Senate version of the new bill will be facing an appropriations committee vote in the near future, as the House appropriations version has passed unanimously.

This move follows the proposal by Prime Minister Joseph Muscat for the EU to become “the Bitcoin continent.” Also read: Malta’s Prime Minister Says Europe Should Become the Bitcoin Continent Malta’s prime minister Joseph Muscat reportedly announced that the first draft of a national strategy to promote Bitcoin and blockchain technology has been approved by the Cabinet, according to Malta Today. At a conference organized by the parliament’s Economic and Financial Affairs Committee, Muscat expressed that Malta will become one of the first countries in the world to embrace Bitcoin and its technology. “I understand that regulators are wary of this technology but the fact is that it’s coming,” he noted. Promising that the strategy will soon be published for public consultation, he said: In February, Bitcoin.com reported on Muscat’s proposal for the EU to become the “Bitcoin continent.” At this conference, the prime minister reiterated his position. He, once again, called for the EU to harness the potential of Bitcoin and seek to become the “Bitcoin continent of Europe”. “Having a strategy would encourage investors to come here. Malta could be a trailblazer in this sphere,” the Times of Malta reported Muscat as saying. “We need to be a frontline country when it comes to this innovation; we cannot wait for the regulators to reach their conclusions and then have to copy what other countries are already doing.” In addition, he explained that “the island also needed to look at adopting cryptocurrency, in spite of the wariness of regulators.” Theo Dix, an EY consultant, said, “if Malta develops a legal framework, blockchain technology companies would be encouraged to come here.” EY (formerly Ernst & Young) co-hosted the conference. His sentiment is echoed by the chairman of the Economic and Financial Affairs Committee, Labour MP Silvio Schembri. He estimates that if Malta can attract even 1 percent of the UK’s fintech post-Brexit, “it would mean an injection of €200 million into the local economy.” He wants Malta to have “the world’s best environment for the development and commercialisation of fintech models and disruptive innovation,” thus fulfilling his dream for the country to become the “the Silicon Valley of Europe”, Malta Today reported. Other than the regulatory framework, Schembri believes Malta already has the right geographical position and weather conditions, as wall as “strong financial system, skills base, entrepreneurial spirit and can-do approach”. All these factors make his country a perfect test-bed for fintech companies. He added: What do you think of Malta’s strategy to embrace Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

He also predicts that the price of bitcoin will go to $2,000. Bitcoin.com looks into how much his net worth is and why he decided to invest in bitcoin. Also read:Â The One Man Supreme Court Bitlicense Battle Begins in Two Weeks On Wednesday, bitcoin investor Michael Novogratz spoke at a forumÂ held at the Harvard Business School Club of New York. Referring to him as a “billionaire investor”,Â CNN Money reported him saying: However, he did not reveal how much his net worth is. Novogratz has given several interviews about Bitcoin and blockchain technology. In May 2015, he gave a detailed explanation of why he personally invested in bitcoin during an interview with Bloomberg. Citing an open source community with âhuge brainpowerâ from âover 30,000 individual programmersâ working on Bitcoin, he said: âI think itâs got first mover advantage, but certainly there are risks,â he further conveyed. âThere will be a revolution in payment systems, and frankly, there will be a democratization of finance at one point.â Novogratz joined Fortress Investment Group four years after it was founded in 1998. He ran the Fortress global funds. In 2007, Forbes listed him #317 on the Forbes 400, a list of America’s richest Billionaires by their estimated net worths.Â His net worth was $1.5 billion that year.Â He became a self-made billionaire âwith the public offering of Fortress Investment Group,â Forbes wrote.Â However, Fortress shares had been sinking since its IPO. By the time Novogratz made the list in 2007, Fortress shares were down 45%, knocking the firmâs founders off the billionaireÂ list, the publication detailed. In 2008, Forbes ranked Novogratz #962Â on its list of “The World’s Billionaires”, even though his net worth had fallen to $1.2 billion. That year, Fortress shares were down 60% since its IPO, to about $12. In 2012, the Observer reportedÂ that âFortress shares were trading in the $3 range, down from a post-IPO high of $24.40, and Mr. Novogratzâs worth had fallen with it, down to about $500 million the last time Forbes checked.â Up until October 2015, Novogratz was still managing approximately $2 billion in assets at Fortress. The fund made a few bad bets about the direction of the Swiss franc and the Brazilian interest rates. Within a couple of months, Novogratz lost about $250 million.Â Faced with the prospect of client redemptions, he cut his losses and vacated his position at Fortress, according to the Wall Street Journal. By that time, Fortress shares had fallen to $6. Today, the shares trade at about $5. While Fortress shares had fallen 70-80% since its IPO and were trading approximately between $5 and $8 in 2013, Novogratz had already moved some of his money into bitcoin. In October 2013, he said at a UBS conference in New York that “I have a nice little bitcoin position,â Bloomberg reported. “Enough that I’m smiling that it doubled,” he added. At that time, the price of one bitcoin was just $175.30.Â He also advised others to invest in bitcoin, stating that: Then, on Wednesday, Novogratz told the Harvard Business School Club crowd that bitcoin’s price will go to $2,000. He also warned them that there will “likely be a bubble” in bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and recommended diversification as a way to handle the bubble.

2017-04-22T12:00:15-04:00,Bitcoin Proponents Are Laser Focused on One Particular Mining Pool,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-proponents-laser-focused-particular-mining-pool/,"Following the Bitcoin scaling debate has been interesting over the past few months. A lot of people have been focused on certain characters and organizations within the cryptocurrency environment by highlighting their opinions and scaling choices on social media. One particular individual and entity of interest has been the mining group F2 Pool and the pool’s associate Wang Chun. Also read: Research Shows How Bitcoin Can Be Attacked Via Internet Routing Infrastructure The Chinese F2 Pool formally known as “Discus Fish” is a mining organization that was formed in May of 2013. The Chinese mining pool is well known for commanding a significant portion of Bitcoin’s hashrate distribution over the past few years. Currently, F2 Pool is the second largest mining operation behind Bitmain’s Antpool capturing 11 percent of the network’s hashrate. People have been focused lately on F2 Pool’s actions because many are curious to find out what scaling solution the pool supports.  So far figuring out whether or not F2 pool supports bigger blocks, or Segregated Witness (Segwit) has been quite confusing. From the signs of things and statements made, the mining pool would like to see both developments move forward. For instance, one vocal member of F2 pool, Wang Chun has been voicing his opinion on the subject for quite some time but in a very cryptic fashion.  Then this week on April 18th the Chinese publication 8BTC’s forum revealed a translated statement from F2 Pool that announced the organization was in favor of Segwit, but the announcement also stated the pool wants a larger block size.   “Most people don’t realize that the debate is about what is best for bitcoin instead of choosing one specific scaling solution, Segwit, BU or other scaling solutions,” explains the mining pool’s announcement. Watching F2 Pool’s scaling signals when the pool mines blocks on the network has also been very confusing. The mining pool has signaled for Segwit but has also shown support for other proposals as well. A few weeks ago for an April Fool’s Day joke, the pool signaled for every proposal on the table including Segwit, Bitcoin Unlimited, Classic, and an 8mb increase. The pool also showed signs of supporting Segwit on the Litecoin network that day. F2 Pool’s Wang Chun told his Twitter followers that day, “Bitclub stole my idea for the upcoming April Fool’s Day. Let’s signal BU + SW + Classic + XT +8M all together!” Furthermore, Wang Chun has been revealing strong opinions about bitcoin development over the past few days. On April 18 Chun compared Core developers to Saddam Hussein winning 100 percent of the vote in 2002. “Core devs are no different from President Hussein IMHO,” explains Chun. The F2 pool associate goes on to say that the scaling debate is not about Segwit at all but more about development communication and listening.  “It’s not about segwit or not,” says Wang Chun. “It’s about communicating, listening, understanding, and respecting. All those the things current Core devs lack.”  The pool has been signaling for Segwit for the past three days according to network statistic websites. It seems the mining pool is pleased with taking a more humorous approach and has no problem joking around about block size debate. However, as the saying goes many true words are said in jest. It’s clear Wang Chun has a lot to say about the scaling subject and believes Bitcoin development communication skills with miners needs improvement. What do you think about F2 Pool’s stance towards the scaling debate? Do you agree with any of Wang Chun’s recent statements towards developers? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-04-21T12:45:02-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin Price Climbs to Higher Peaks,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoin-price-climbs-higher-peaks/,"The price of bitcoin continues to ascend upwards reaching new highs during the end of April. Last week our markets update revealed bitcoin markets experienced a slight bearish hiccup as the price per BTC dropped to a low of $1140. Now the value has been steadily progressing back up over the past three days breaking key resistance and currently testing new levels at $1260 per BTC, at the time of writing. Also read: Japanese City Accepts Bitcoin Donations Another exciting week has passed in the world of cryptocurrency markets and trading. Bitcoin’s market value is on the move again as the digital asset has broken into a higher price territory hovering at $1240-1260 per BTC, depending on which exchange price you observe. Traders have noticed a significant difference in price spreads across global exchanges but most notably the price on the Bitfinex exchange. On April 20 the price per BTC hit a high of $1336 on Bitfinex as the price was $90 higher than most exchanges. Price spreads remain inconsistent at press time as Bitfinex prices reveal a $1320 per BTC average over the past four hours.  Technical indicators show the bullish price run may continue as bitcoin charts show the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still well above the 200 SMA, indicating higher price levels are possible. Order books across many exchanges indicate buyers are in control, but there is key resistance around the $1300 mark. The Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) also shows the upswing is looking to test new levels, but the Stochastic analysis suggests bitcoin is getting psychologically expensive and sellers could step in at any moment. For now, bulls have the market for the time being, and a few more spikes seem likely in the short term. Over the past few days, most of the cryptocurrency community has been following the developments with the exchange Bitfinex. Currently, the exchange has halted most fiat withdrawals and has explained it is having issues with banking partners. One would think the news of Bitfinex not allowing withdrawals would affect the price negatively but the opposite happened. Instead, the global average of bitcoin’s price continued to rise and oddly enough significantly higher on Bitfinex. Some skeptics within the community have compared the different price spreads to the Mt Gox prices of 2013. On April 20 the exchange made an announcement about the banking issues and dismissing rumors of insolvency stating; Overall cryptocurrency markets are currently capturing record highs of $29.6 billion with an average of $600 million in daily trade volume. The second largest valued market Ethereum is currently encompassing $4.4 billion of the overall market share with a price at $48 per ether. Ripple (XRP) markets have dipped to a low of under 3 cents per XRP, but the digital currency still holds the third highest market capitalization. The fourth runner-up Litecoin is currently experiencing a bull run after hitting a low of $9.50 per LTC but is now averaging over $11 per token. The LTC price rise could possibly be attributed to the Litecoin Global Roundtable Resolution a roundtable meeting dedicated to the scaling discussion. Dash markets seem uncertain as the digital currency has tried to test new levels but has been kept pushed down. Currently, Dash is around $70 each and has a market cap of around $547 million. Most of the other altcoins in the top ten are doing well seeing price rises between 20-30 percent. For instance, Ethereum Classic is reaching new highs at $3.25 per ETC at press time. Alongside this three new cryptocurrencies are close to joining the cryptocurrency top ten which include PIVX, Golem, and Zcash.  Many bitcoin proponents are excited about this month’s bull run, but the unusual market spreads have made people uncertain. Plenty of people have attributed the price success to Japan’s recent digital currency legislation alongside growing demand in countries like India. Traders will be watching the exchanges Bitfinex, Okcoin, and BTC-e as all of them seem to be experiencing banking issues. Furthermore many continue to wonder when Chinese exchanges will reinstate withdrawals as well, as people are growing concerned with the regulatory bumps in the road worldwide. Bear Scenario: If there is an upcoming correction in price coming, it looks like bitcoin could hold steady between the $1150-1180 range again. There’s quite a bit of support in that price territory, and Stochastic indicators show buyers may jump to the sidelines in the short term. Inconsistent price spreads also indicate as they have in the past a negative downturn could happen at any moment. Bull Scenario: Bitcoin’s price can very well rise above the $1300 price range across other global exchanges disregarding the current wacky price displayed on Bitfinex charts. SMA and RSI technical indicators and order books show the bull run should continue for the short term and into the weekend. Traders on Trading View and other forums seem to agree bitcoin’s price is still “long.”         What do you think about Bitcoin’s price trends at the moment? Do you think global bitcoin markets will climb to $1,300 and up? Let us know in the comments below.

Now the famous city of Hirosaki is accepting donations for its well known Cherry Blossom Festival that gathers millions of visitors each year. Also read: Japan Declares Sale of Bitcoin Exempt from Consumption Tax On April 20 the city of Hirosaki has announced it will be collecting bitcoin donations to help preserve its 2600 cherry blossom trees and the annual festival held at the end of the month. The news of Hirosaki city officials choosing to accept bitcoin donations was also reported on by the national Japanese broadcast NHK. The Japanese city is well known for the tree festival conducted around the Hirosaki Castle Park. The festival has over 2 million visitors every year who observe the fifty types of cherry blossom trees in the city. However according to city officials taking care of the trees is costly and Hirosaki city officials have partnered with the Japanese exchange Coincheck to accept bitcoin donations.          “We expect bitcoin donations to be an effective approach to promote Hirosaki’s cherry blossoms and a castle especially to people living outside of Japan,” explains Hirosaki’s city committee. “We also expect bitcoin donations to be a unique tourism promotion. When it comes to more practical benefits, bitcoin donations require much lower initial cost and running cost compared to traditional methods.”  City officials detail donations have always gone towards taking care of the thousands of trees alongside maintaining the 400-year-old Hirosaki Castle for future visitors. Bitcoin contributions will help preserve the trees and repair broken stone on the castle walls explains the Hirosaki city committee. Furthermore, the city said they will further investigate both positives and negatives concerning using bitcoin to facilitate donations. The Japanese trading platform Coincheck who helped facilitate the deal with the city of Hirosaki has been on a mission promoting bitcoin in Japan since 2012. The firm has made headway in the region, and quite a few merchants use the service to accept bitcoin in their stores and restaurants.  Just recently Coincheck and the popular Japanese exchange Bitflyer announced both firms would help thousands of merchants in Japan accept bitcoin this summer. Coincheck is pleased to assist the city of Hirosaki to begin accepting bitcoin for the Cherry Blossom Festival donations and hopes other local Japanese city officials adopt the payment method. “Bitcoin allows accepting donations regardless of regions due to its borderlessness. As one of the largest bitcoin company, Coincheck will continue to promote bitcoin donation around the world,” the Japanese exchange stated.

2017-04-20T18:00:50-04:00,Blockchain Surveillance Tool Created for Banks to Visualize Bitcoin Risks,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/blockchain-surveillance-tool-banks-visualize-bitcoin-risks/,"The blockchain forensics company Elliptic has announced a new tool designed to help banks visualize illegal activities when dealing with Bitcoin-based startups. The firm has partnered with Silvergate Bank, a financial institution that has made connections with quite a few businesses within the Bitcoin industry.  Also read: Has the Next Satoshi Nakamoto Revealed Himself in Bali? Blockchain surveillance operations seem to be making headway with law enforcement agencies and financial businesses worldwide. This week, the startup Elliptic has announced a new monitoring tool and the company’s partnership with Silvergate Bank. According to Elliptic, the platform which the two firms designed will give financial institutions better insight into Bitcoin-related risks that don’t comply with current regulatory standards. Founded in 2013 by James Smith, Adam Joyce, and Tom Robinson, Elliptic has raised US$7 million since the company’s inception. Investors injecting money into Elliptic’s coffers include Digital Currency Group and banks like Santander. Moreover, the startup claims that it has already produced substantial evidence for law enforcement agencies worldwide. “Our proprietary database links millions of Bitcoin addresses to thousands of clear web and dark web entities,” Elliptic’s website details. “We back this up with transparent documentary evidence. We have delivered actionable evidence in cases involving international arms trafficking, money laundering, theft, and drug offenses.” The company became well known when it introduced the “Bitcoin Big Bang,” a visualization tool that analyzes “the emergence over time of the largest entities on the Bitcoin blockchain, and their interconnectivity.” The latest tool from the London-based blockchain surveillance startup will help banks when dealing with Bitcoin-based companies in order to stay compliant with regulatory guidelines. “The banks that are working with Bitcoin companies really don’t have much visibility into how effective they are at handling the risk associated with Bitcoin transactions,” explained James Smith, the CEO at Elliptic. The news comes at a time when banks have been known to stop working with Bitcoin companies like exchanges when it comes to accounts and operations like wire transfers. Over the past two weeks, quite a few bitcoin trading platforms have had issues dealing with financial institutions and their de-risking methods. Elliptic and Silvergate Bank believe giving banks better visibility will make things easier for both parties. The Californian financial institution has bolstered Bitcoin for quite some time. The president and CEO of Silvergate Bank, Alan Lane, has been trying to get bankers to discuss the subject of digital currencies at California Bankers Association meetings. Furthermore, the bank has made connections with fifteen Bitcoin businesses and other members of the blockchain industry in order to further its goals. With a network of banking institutions and Bitcoin companies using Elliptic’s new tool, the two firms hope it will bring more confidence to financial incumbents dealing with the cryptocurrency.  What do you think about Elliptic’s new tool that gives banks visibility to unsavory activity on the Bitcoin blockchain?

2017-04-20T08:00:15-04:00,Research Shows How Bitcoin Can Be Attacked Via Internet Routing Infrastructure,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/research-bitcoin-attacked-internet-routing-infrastructure/,"Researchers from ETH Zurich and the Hebrew University have found how “internet routing attacks” and “malicious Internet Service Providers (ISPs)” can attack the Bitcoin network. In their research paper entitled “Hijacking Bitcoin: Routing Attacks on Cryptocurrencies”, they describe the attacks as well as countermeasures against them. The paper will be presented at the 2017 IEEE Symposium on security and privacy in May. Also read: Attacks on Data Privacy May Get Scarier in 2017 There are already many known Bitcoin attack vectors such as double spending, the 51% attack, DDoS, eclipsing, and transaction malleability. However, the authors asserted that: While a Bitcoin node can be run from anywhere on earth, the researchers found that most of them are hosted with a few ISPs. Specifically, they found that 13 ISPs host 30% of the entire Bitcoin network. In addition, 60% of all possible Bitcoin connections cross 3 ISPs. “Together, these two characteristics make it relatively easy for a malicious ISP to intercept a lot of Bitcoin traffic,” they wrote, adding that “any third-party on the forwarding path can eavesdrop, drop, modify, inject, or delay Bitcoin messages such as blocks or transactions.” The paper then describes two types of attacks claimed to be practical and possible today. The first is called a “Partition attack” which aims to partition the Bitcoin network or “completely disconnect a set of nodes from the network”. The second is called a “Delay attack” which aims to delay the propagation of new blocks to a set of Bitcoin nodes without disrupting their connections. To determine their effects, the authors set up a network and initiated the attacks on themselves. They performed a hijack in the wild against their own Bitcoin nodes to learn the effect of a Partition attack. For a Delay attack, they used an interception software against their own Bitcoin nodes. They eventually came to the conclusion that: The paper offers various suggestions to combat the routing attacks of both kinds. While nothing is a cure for all attack types, the more countermeasures deployed, the more effective a defense Bitcoin users will have. Both long and short-term countermeasures were suggested. Recommended strategies include increasing the diversity of node connections, selecting Bitcoin peers that are routed further away, monitoring round-trip communication times, and even encrypting all node traffic. The research team also proposes monitoring any other additional statistics so that deviations from normal behaviors can be immediately identified at each node. The full list of countermeasures can be seen here. What do you think of these attacks? Let us know in the comments section below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock Have you seen our new widget service?

2017-04-19T16:30:31-04:00,More Bitcoin Exchanges Fall Victim to Banking Problems,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-exchanges-victim-banking-problems/,"Following Bitfinex’s announcement to disable fiat deposits, more bitcoin exchanges are having the same issue. The other trading platforms have also disabled incoming USD wire transfers, citing bank account and “intermediary bank” problems. Also read: Bitfinex’s Problems Pile Up: Deposits Disabled, Withdrawals Delayed Bitfinex is not the only bitcoin exchange which has disabled fiat deposits. The bitcoin exchange Btc-e has also announced on Twitter that it is not accepting U.S. dollar wire transfers until the end of the month, citing a bank account problem. The Chinese exchange, Okcoin, is also reportedly having the same issue. A Reddit user posted a message supposedly displayed on the user’s account stating that U.S. dollar deposits have been temporarily suspended since Wednesday “because of the issues with intermediary banks.” The announcement further reads: “Please do not make further deposit as your wires may be rejected by intermediary banks. We are now actively looking for alternatives to resume deposit as soon as possible.” A few other cryptocurrency services and money service businesses are reportedly encountering the same problem as well. Intermediary banks and correspondent banks are third party banks. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably. Regardless of any slight differences, they both facilitate international fund transfers as well as transaction settlements. When Bitfinex filed a lawsuit against Wells Fargo, it was revealed that Wells Fargo was acting as a correspondent bank for the Taiwan-based banks which Bitfinex uses. Big banks have been known to “de-risk” correspondent banking relationships that are considered high risk for their businesses. It is a common problem. According to the World Bank, “this risk avoidance would typically occur on a wholesale basis, without a case-by-case assessment of the risk associated with individual customers, or the country or region involved, or as a result of an analysis indicating that the business relationship as a whole was no longer profitable.” Therefore, it would not be uncommon for a bank such as Wells Fargo to sever its correspondent banking relationships with other Bitcoin businesses in the same way it did with Bitfinex. Following Wells Fargo’s de-risking decision which only affected outgoing wires, Bitfinex informed customers that all its incoming wires will be “blocked and refused” by its Taiwan banks. According to an article by Whalecalls, banks in Taiwan did not previously have strict AML/KYC requirements, but they were enough to comply with U.S. regulations. However, the U.S. has recently revised these requirements. The U.S. Department of Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (Fincen) is now requiring businesses operating as a money transmitter to report any suspicious activities. “A report must be filed when a transaction that is conducted by, at or through the MSB [money service business] is both: suspicious, and $2,000 or more,” Fincen wrote on its website. Bitcoin exchanges are classified as money transmitters, according to the agency. While the U.S. has tightened its control over activities of money transmitters, Taiwan also has its own agenda when it comes to ramping up its AML/KYC efforts. On March 16, the Taiwanese government established an office to combat money laundering to help build a more transparent and orderly financial environment, according to Focus Taiwan publication. It also aims to beef up “money laundering prevention before the third evaluation round of the Asia/Pacific Group on Money Laundering (APG) next year,” the publication reported the country’s Premier Lin Chuan saying, adding that Taiwan is currently on the APG watch list. In August last year, the New York State’s Department of Financial Services (DFS) fined Taiwan’s Mega Bank US$180 million “for its poor compliance practices, after identifying ‘a number of suspicious transactions’ between the bank’s New York and Panama branches,” the publication further details. The Taiwanese Deputy Justice Minister Tsai Pi-Chung then noted that this incident damaged the credibility of Taiwan’s financial activities worldwide, which should be rectified. Bitcoin exchanges’ deposit problems started soon after the Taiwanese regulators set up the AML office. While U.S banks are de-risking and Taiwan is determined to regain its credibility, so that it is taken off the APG watch list, the situation is looking grim for any bitcoin exchanges using banks in Taiwan.

2017-04-18T15:00:31-04:00,Bitcoin Demand Continues to Rise in India as Cash Reserves Run Dry,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-demand-rise-cash-run-dry-india/,"This week all eyes are watching India as citizens are having trouble accessing cash reserves as ATMs run dry throughout the country. Alongside these troublesome economic times, bitcoin trading is increasing substantially in India, as the country is one of the hottest bitcoin regions in the world right now next to China and Japan. Also read: Bitcoin Adoption in Thailand Led by Tourism Industry Right now there is significant demand in India for cash as banks and ATMs within the country are currently experiencing a shortage of physical notes. According to regional publications, some regions in India are reporting 90 percent of the local ATMs do not have cash. Sources in the country say the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has moved some of its cash reserves to certain areas within the country due to the recent elections. Furthermore, the State Bank of India (SBI) has revealed the cash crisis has caused customers to start losing confidence in the system because there is nothing local bank executives can do. “Nearly 70 percent of our 648 ATMs in the three districts are out of cash. The rest will also become dry in the next few days as we do not have cash to refill the machines. We are helpless from our side,” said the deputy general manager of SBI, Ajoy Kumar Pandit. Recently some members of the Indian government have made some negative statements towards bitcoin, but it hasn’t slowed down cryptocurrency demand in India. Additionally, leaders within the region have formed a committee to investigate the cryptocurrency and will release a report on bitcoin in three months. A few days after the government committee formation, bitcoin startups within the region also created a coalition to discuss the subject with Indian officials. The companies involved with the newly formed group called the “Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India” (DABFI) include Bitcoin-focused startups such as Zebpay, Unocoin, Coinsecure and Searchtrade. “We request the committee to give us an opportunity to meet them and showcase the benefits of this technology for our country,” explained the DABFI. “Financial inclusion, cheaper cross-border remittance, full trace and track on the movement of value on the blockchain network, and the potential for India to become a financial hub are key benefits that can be derived using virtual currencies.” Alongside cash demand, Bitcoin is doing phenomenally well in India, and there is significant market demand for the decentralized currency. Localbitcoins volumes in India are still very high with an average of 20,000,000 INR or $300,000 USD during the first week of April. Furthermore, price spreads across Indian exchanges are currently $50 higher than most global averages at the time of writing. Moreover, just like in China, bitcoin traders and enthusiasts are doing quite well in India trading bitcoin. According to a recent article from the Times of India, the decentralized cryptocurrency is becoming attractive because it can be used to move money across the world in a permissionless way. Benson Samuel, CTO, and founder of exchange Coinsecure has found customers are using the exchange for arbitrage. “One lady used to buy from our exchange, and within a few hours, sell it on another. That works because different exchanges have different prices,” explains Samuel. As cash reserves run dry in India, many citizens have found a safe haven and store of value with bitcoin. Right now most Indians look at bitcoin as an asset class and are waiting for the government to consider it a legal form of payment much like Japan’s recent rulings. “Like gold, Indians believe that to be an asset class, and its actual use case is only 1% of total transaction value. We believe that once Indian merchants get clarity on regulation and taxation of bitcoins, we will see them using it as a payment gateway,” Saurabh Agarwal, co-founder, and CEO of Indian Bitcoin exchange Zebpay adds.

2017-04-18T12:00:30-04:00,Inside LBC: How This Group Aims to Find a Bitcoin Cryptographic Collision,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/group-aims-find-bitcoin-cryptographic-collision/,"Around eight months ago a group called “Large Bitcoin Collider” (LBC) was formed aimed at cracking bitcoin wallets with hopes of finding a cryptographic collision within the protocol. The LBC server lets anyone download the software and attempt to take a crack at Bitcoin’s underlying cryptography. Also read: NSA Exploits Reveal the World of 1984 Is Here Announced last year on Bitcointalk.org a ‘hero member’ from the forum named Rico revealed an unusual project. Rico detailed the formation of a new group of cryptography proponents looking to brute-force bitcoin addresses and hopefully find a cryptographic collision along the way. The group’s project is a homage to the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s strongest particle collider.   A computational collision or clash occurs when two different inputs from a cryptographic function such as a digest, checksum, or hash value produce the same output. LBC considers itself a “distributed effort” to find one collision of private keys and checks against a list of “known BTC addresses with funds on them.” The reason the members of LBC started the project is because the current majority believes what they are doing is “impossible” and “that is a gauntlet thrown down,” explains the cryptography enthusiasts. Furthermore, as far as the legality of what they are doing LBC leaves a disclaimer on the group’s website stating; So far LBC has generated roughly 3500 keys with a minuscule amount of trophies. Of all the cracked addresses LBC has compromised, most of them contain zero bitcoins, but the distributed pool has managed to scrape $68 worth of BTC so far. However, many people believe the addresses cracked by LBC were mere “puzzle” wallets that can be found online which are set up to be easily cracked and emptied by BTC treasure hunters. In a recent interview with the publication Motherboard, Rico believes finding a collision wouldn’t be the end of bitcoin.    “Finding a P2PKH-collision would probably mean the end of P2PKH but not bitcoin,” Rico tells the news outlet by email. “Bitcoin would evolve with new address types. Most certainly it wouldn’t ‘die’ because of this.” The attempt to find a cryptographic collision within the Bitcoin protocol has been tried by researchers, cryptographers, and mathematicians both in theory and in practice for quite some time. For instance, there are many discussions concerning this subject across bitcoin-focused forums and social media. A year ago a thread on Reddit revealed a tool that generated partial address collisions. The creator ran the application for a week using a CPU generating an 80-bit collision or half of what is needed to find two private keys. The tool can be found on Github, and an example of the findings had shown 15 characters of an address match and looked like this; One reason people think a collision is possible within the bitcoin network is due to the recent cracking of SHA-1 cryptographic algorithm by the Google corporation. Many people in the past had theoretically broken the SHA-1 infrastructure, and the cryptography was considered weak by leading security firms. The tech giant revealed to the public this past February that it broke SHA-1 in practice with its project “Shattered”, which disturbed scientists everywhere within the cryptographic research community. On February 23, 2017, Google announced; “Today, more than 20 years after of SHA-1 was first introduced, we are announcing the first practical technique for generating a collision,” Google detailed. “For the tech community, our findings emphasize the necessity of sunsetting SHA-1 usage — We hope that our practical attack against SHA-1 will finally convince the industry that it is urgent to move to safer alternatives such as SHA-256.” With SHA-1 being broken in less than twenty years shows that precautions may need to be taken in the future concerning the cryptography behind the Bitcoin network. There’s no telling when that will be, and many are not concerned because the effort to break bitcoin’s encryption is no easy task. Google’s massive work to compute the Shattered collision was one of the largest computations ever completed. The breaking of SHA-1 took nine quintillion SHA1 computations in total showing no ordinary set up could complete the task. With Bitcoin, the bar of difficulty to crack one single address is far higher than SHA-1 and would take far more effort than nine quintillion computations. In 2011 the Bitcoin network was processing over fifteen trillion SHA-256 hashes per second. The computational operation to find a collision during this period would take roughly 0.65 billion years, and with the Bitcoin network’s 2017 performance it would take even longer.

2017-04-18T08:00:40-04:00,Bitcoin Adoption in Thailand Led by Tourism Industry,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-adoption-thailand-tourism-industry-scaling-debate/,"The Bitcoin scaling debate affects some businesses more than others, but few real-world businesses have the volume to watch Bitcoin’s momentum react to it like the tourist hotspot, the Pattaya Beer Garden. Bitcoin.com discussed adoption trends in Thailand with Peter Noid, the proprietor of this large and popular restaurant and bar located in Pattaya, a resort city south-east of Bangkok. Also read: Bitcoin Startups Challenging Big Banks Profits With seating for 400 and “around 2,000 visitors a day,” the Pattaya Beer Garden started accepting bitcoin in early 2014 when the Thai government first eased its stance on Bitcoin’s legality. “I was an early Bitcoin supporter,” Noid told Bitcoin.com. “We started accepting it as soon as the Thai government said it was not illegal to do so.” In 2013, the Thai central bank declared the use of bitcoin illegal in Thailand, but changed its opinion in early 2014 to make it not illegal. However, buying bitcoin in Thailand and then selling it outside the country was still strictly prohibited, Noid explained. The revised stance “enabled us to begin accepting bitcoin,” he recalled. While there is currently no official law governing Bitcoin in the country, the central bank’s opinion is revered, and early adopters there have had to tread lightly. The infrastructure for Bitcoin acceptance has grown but merchants are still very cautious to this day. “Bitcoin is well established in Thailand with a number of good local exchanges that have good liquidity,” Noid described. However, “merchant acceptance is very low. Just a few of us in Pattaya and a few more in Bangkok,” he added. Noid uses Bitpay for merchant processing. “We hold 100% in bitcoin. I have never cashed out,” he conveyed, noting that he has been a big believer in Bitcoin’s future. While only a small percentage of his business is currently done in bitcoin, it is still at a frequency far higher than most bitcoin-accepting establishments receive. The beer garden gets “on average 1 or 2 bitcoin transactions a day,” he revealed, adding that: To that end, Noid placed “we accept bitcoin” stickers predominantly around the premises which has led to “hundreds of inquiries about what the heck is Bitcoin.” This allows him to introduce many new people to the digital currency. “I enjoy doing that,” he said. “Tourism is the 2nd biggest industry in Thailand and the biggest industry by far in Pattaya,” Noid noted. The beachfront town receives roughly 8 million visitors each year from every corner of the globe. “Bitcoin customers reflect that diversity although I would say Americans are probably the largest group of users we see,” he said. “On any day you could easily find visitors from 25 different countries at the Pattaya Beer Garden.” This makes the establishment one of the few places where one can watch global Bitcoin adoption trends in the wild on a daily basis. The beer garden is an expansive tourist spot in one of the most congested parts of the main Pattaya strip, with a dining area overhanging the water. The tourist hangout is patronized by customers from diverse demographics. The group consists of “a lot of couples which are predominantly 40+ American and European males and 20+ Thai females,” Noid divulged. “Quite a few Thai family groups and younger foreign men as well.” He sees a lot of young Russian couples and older Chinese men too, and it’s this latter group that he often sees paying in bitcoin. “There are not a lot of places you can do that in Thailand so it’s a novelty for a lot of Bitcoiners,” Noid conveyed. “I have personally met many of these people and had some great discussions.” The beer garden gets “a lot of visitors who come specifically to spend their bitcoin,” he added. In Thailand, like most countries, credit cards are widely known and accepted. “However a lot of tourists are reluctant to use [credit cards] because of fraud which is also well known here,” he explained, adding ATM fraud to the list of problems with the legacy financial system in Thailand. “For me, bitcoin is clearly the superior choice but of course most of our customers do not know that,” he said. “Bitcoin should be more widely adopted as it is so easy and safe for tourists.” That’s why the Pattaya Beer Garden accepts zero-confirmation transactions for all bitcoin payments. “Any other choice would not be practical in a retail situation. We have never had one go bad and we have well over a thousand transactions,” he shared, illustrating the ample goodwill that still exists in the Bitcoin community. “It [Bitcoin adoption] grew quite rapidly until the ‘don’t buy a coffee with Bitcoin’ meme grew as well,” he recalled. With a saddened heart, he added, “We have seen little growth in bitcoin transactions this past year.” In fact, he said: “Paying for your beer or coffee may not be an important economic function but it makes Bitcoin real in people’s minds,” Noid stated. In his view, the current impasse in the scaling debate is the culprit that is “doing immense harm” to Bitcoin adoption. Specifically, “high fees and long confirmation times are definitely impacting adoption. That saddens me greatly,” he admitted. “I was quite active getting other merchants to accept bitcoin here but I no longer advocate this,” he continued. “The present gridlock in Bitcoin is not something I wish to explain to potential merchant adopters.” Noid fully understands that Bitcoin “cannot scale on chain to Visa/Mastercard levels,” and contemplated “second layer solutions may well be the answer or any other of the myriad proposals.” However, he made his stance clear that Bitcoin needs a quick fix in the meantime. “While that gets sorted out we need to scale on-chain right now to allow adoption to continue increasing and create more customers for whatever other scaling solutions actually get implemented,” he said, adding that: Do you think the scaling debate is holding back other merchants like it does in Thailand?

2017-04-18T06:00:09-04:00,Rootstock Engineer Discovers Quadratic Delays in Bitcoin Scripts,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/rootstock-engineer-quadratic-delays-bitcoin-scripts/,"On April 16 the chief engineer of Rootstock, Sergio Demian Lerner, revealed in a blog post that he had found new quadratic delays in Bitcoin scripts while researching the Segregated Witness (Segwit) protocol. Also Read: Lerner Offers a Block Size Compromise with Segwit2MB Lerner details he began researching Segwit scaling last week and started studying the code “specifically, the EvalScript() function.” During this time, Lerner found two quadratic complexity loops in the Bitcoin Core protocol. The results of the tests shouldn’t make anyone worry, Lerner says, as he believes there are “worse problems in Bitcoin block verification.” However, he goes on to detail one possible attack scenario from a malicious miner within the network.         “A malicious miner can create a Segwit block that requires approximately 10 seconds to be verified,” explains Rootstock’s chief engineer. “Since the examples presented in this post consume less than 10 seconds.” Lerner goes on further describing an issue that he calls “the unsatisfied questioner: OP_IF abuse” problem, and an issue called “Rock-and-Roll” which is located in the OP_ROLL opcode. He also details that a lot has been done as far as optimizing block processing but says “there are a few pieces of old code that still require some minor optimizations to prevent future surprises in the scaling path.”  As the research from Lerner gained attention across forums and social media, most people were pleased with the engineer’s discoveries. One Reddit user exclaims, “It’s important that these exploits are found, disclosed, and hopefully patched.” In addition, Bitcoin security expert Kristov Atlas complemented Lerner and his findings via Twitter, stating:          Another idea brought to light on Lerner’s blog post comes from a commenter asking, “Do you have already an opinion on BUIP033: Parallel Validation?” BUIP033 is a concept conceived by Bitcoin developer Peter Tschipper in October of 2016, which proposes to create a separate thread for block validation. Essentially this would be in contrast to the current method of validating each block through the main processing thread. “I think it is essential to scalability,” Lerner replies to the comment. “It reduces the impact of all block-size related issues.” The Rootstock engineer has voiced his opinion quite a bit throughout the great Bitcoin scaling debate. The developer has also written a block size proposal recently which involves Segwit and a 2mb block size increase. The “Segwit 2mb – combined soft/hard fork” scaling plan got mixed responses and reviews from Bitcoin developers last month. Lerner is also one of the inventors of the controversial mining patent ASIC Boost which has escalated the scaling discussion to new levels.

Also read: An Introduction to Bitcoin Trading and Technical Charts Today we’re going to discuss the many sites across the web that offer Bitcoin network statistical data. Many of these online tools are useful to track and chart the protocols daily action as well as give answers to questions concerning the cryptocurrency’s behavior. This includes various blockchain explorers, node counters, and many more interesting analytical tools that provide a different perspective on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Blockchain explorers are useful to Bitcoin users as they help identify all the transactions that take place since the inception of the cryptocurrency’s distributed ledger. In the early days there were only a few blockchain explorers in existence but now there’s a lot as the Bitcoin environment has grown. Blockchain.info Blockchain otherwise known as Blockchain.info is one of the oldest blockchain explorers to date. Using blockchain’s website users can enter a bitcoin address to view its contents, transaction identifiers, and more to get visibility to all the transactions within the network. Blockchain will give you information on the fee paid per transaction, the block height the transaction was included in, how many confirmations took place, and more. Blockchain.info also has a vast amount of statistics and charts on the website. Bitcoiners can visualize block details, mining data, currency statistics, and various network activity. The most popular stats on Blockchain’s website include the price per BTC, average block size, the daily transaction count, and the mempool size. OXT   Another interesting blockchain explorer is the “open exploration tool” (OXT), an exploratory blockchain analysis tool. Just like any other blockchain explorer OXT can display transactions happening on the Bitcoin network. However, the website also analyzes different types of behavior on the Bitcoin blockchain using various charting and plotting tools. This includes temporal charts covering fees, transactions, scripts, and more. OXT also offers scatter plots as well giving a different perspective on transaction and bitcoin address behavior. Other popular blockchain explorers that provide similar transaction data and some charts include Blockcypher, Insight, Blocktrail, and Sochain. Each explorer shows blockchain data a little differently but more or less contains the same information about transactions. Statoshi.info The website Statoshi.info has a lot of real-time Bitcoin network statistics. The website’s individual dashboards show node counts, bandwidth usage, fee estimates, system metrics, mempool data and more. Statoshi.info has been around for a few years now, and each dashboard display shows various charts that analyzes particular sections of the network and protocol’s behavior. Bitcoin Wisdom    Bitcoin Wisdom is also another charting website that’s been around for quite some time. The website’s price charts are one of the most popular sections within the web portal. Bitcoin Wisdom’s price charts display various exchanges including Bitstamp, BTCC, Kraken, Bitfinex and more. Furthermore, Bitcoin Wisdom also shows other statistical data such as network difficulty, and the past and present hashrate. Tradeblock Another website that reports statistical Bitcoin network data includes Tradeblock. The Tradeblock engine offers a wide variety of graphical charts displaying both historical and current Bitcoin statistics. The website’s interface displays the mempool count, blocks mined, transaction count, and many more useful network diagrams. Tradeblock also monitors the Ethereum blockchain and has its own blockchain explorers as well. Blockseer     Blockseer is another exploratory blockchain tool that wants users to “follow the bitcoin.” The tool shows a visual interpretation of transactions on the network alongside the connections each transaction has with individual addresses. The site traces bitcoin origins and follows the path of bitcoins traveling throughout the blockchain using a visual diagram. Node Counter  Node Counter is an analytical website that tracks Bitcoin nodes throughout the network. This includes Bitcoin Classic, Bitcoin Unlimited (BU), XT, and Core nodes in a graphical setting. Each table shows various nodes within the network alongside pools signaling alternate Bitcoin clients and block size proposals. Node counter displays data using both line graphs and pie charts as well. Bitnodes 21 Inc’s Bitnodes is another popular node tracking website that displays various charts and graphs concerning Bitcoin network nodes. The site gives a current network snapshot and also a search engine to check on node status. Bitnodes also displays Classic, BU, Core, and XT nodes within the network. Coin Dance Last but not least in the node counting realm is the website Coin Dance which shows various summaries and charts concerning nodes across the network. The graphical interface also charts the different node implementations like Core and XT with many types of charts. Furthermore, Coin Dance is a popular site for many other statistics such as Localbitcoins and Paxful volumes, and even charts on political opinions in regards to Segregated Witness, Emergent Consensus, and the most recent UASF (BIP 148) support from well-known industry businesses. All of these monitoring websites offer a different view of the network, and each one has various merits depending on what you’re looking for. The information these tools provide can improve our relationship with the network by getting a better understanding of what’s going on. A graphical display is sometimes a better method for people interpreting network activity and the protocols behavior. Bitcoin.com also has a tool section and various statistical information that can be found on our website as well. Using our transaction value lookup tool simply add a bitcoin transaction TXID and find it’s price in the past. For those who are extremely passionate about the subject of Bitcoin, there’s plenty of statistics and information to gather each and every day. What monitoring sites do you use?

2017-04-16T10:15:12-04:00,Bitcoin Startups Challenging Big Banks Profits,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-startups-challenging-big-banks-profits/,"Big banks are increasingly worried about losing profits to fintech companies such as Bitcoin startups. Eighty-eight percent of banks’ executives believe that their businesses are at risk of losing revenues to these new entrants, according to a recent survey. This profit loss could be as high as 10 percent at Santander Bank, a leaked memo shows. Also read: Mexico’s New Bill Could Be a Game Changer for Bitcoin One of the “Big Four” audit firms, Pricewaterhousecoopers (Pwc), published “A Global Fintech Report 2017” early this month, showing that 88% of surveyed incumbents’ executives believe their businesses to be at risk of losing revenues to fintech startups. The firm wrote: Last week, Guardian Money reported on a leaked internal memo of Santander Bank which reveals that 10% of the bank’s profits come from its international cash transfer business. The documents detail how the bank charges six times more than its fintech rivals, making huge profits by giving customers poor exchange rates. Rather than charging them fees directly, big banks cash in on the difference between the money markets exchange rates and the rate they offer customers, which is known as the “FX margin”. “Santander made €585m from money transfers – equal to nearly a tenth of its 2016 global profit of €6.2bn – and that it charges six times as much as rival Transferwise for sending £10,000 from the UK to Spain,” the publication wrote. The memo informs Santander executives that new startups entering the money transfer business are “attacking the profitable slices” of the bank’s business, noting that: The Santander’s memo draws attention to money transfer service company Transferwise, stating that the service charges “€64 to move £10,000 from the UK to Spain” while “Santander charged €394 – six times as much”. If Santander were to charge the same as Transferwise, “its revenue would collapse from €585m to €95m, a fall of 84%,” Guardian Money wrote. Launched in January 2011 and headquartered in London, Transferwise is a peer-to-peer money transfer service with eight offices worldwide. The company says it has more than a million customers and processes over $700 million in transactions every month. Unfortunately, the company states in its “Acceptable Use Policy” that it does not provide services to businesses involving bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. Many money transfer startups today use Bitcoin in their businesses. Most of them offer low rates and no transfer fees. Below are some examples. Recently, Bitcoin.com interviewed Luis Buenaventura, Chief Technology Officer at Bitcoin remittance startup Bloom Solutions who has also written a book on remittances. He said that Bitcoin’s “strongest use case was probably remittances,” at least in his country, the Philippines. Bloom Solutions’ website claims to offer a solution for agents and resellers in the international remittance market a way to “reduce your international settlement and FX Costs by up to 50%.” The Singapore-based Coinpip is an example of a Bitcoin remittance company which offers services in more than 40 countries worldwide. The company charges “no forex and other hidden charges”, its website states. Another example is the Hong Kong-based Bitspark, which offers bitcoin-backed remittance service in five different currencies. The company told Bitcoin.com in an interview in February that “in competitive corridors, total costs can be as low as 2-3% with traditional providers on an average transaction size of $250 equivalent”. Then there is Abra, which has a different business model. The startup uses Bitcoin, smart contracts, and a peer to peer human teller network to transfer money directly from a sender to the recipient globally without a middleman. The company’s recently-launched app charges no transfer fees and advertises “low exchange rates”, allowing users to add and withdraw funds in bitcoin as well. How much of big banks’ profits do you think will be lost to Bitcoin startups? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-04-16T04:00:58-04:00,Bitcoinâs Blockchain Timestamping Standards Face Off,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-blockchain-timestamping-standards-face-off/,"A new version of the timestamping standard ChainpointÂ is being tested and will be released soon with new functionalities. However, the lead developer for competing standard Opentimestamps claims that the new version is too close to his teamâs code. This article explores how Chainpoint works and how it compares to Opentimestamps. Also read:Â Veriphant Helps Enable Legal Proofs in the Bitcoin Blockchain ChainpointÂ is âan open standard for creating a timestamp proof of any data, file, or series of events,â its website describes. It was developed by blockchain data platform TierionÂ âfor recording data in the blockchainâ as well as providing âirrefutable proof that your data was recorded in the Bitcoin blockchain.â ChainpointÂ claims to be able to: Using Chainpoint, data is hashed and aggregated together using a Merkle tree, with its root anchored in the Bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains, its website details. The process creates a JSON-LD document, referred to as a Chainpoint âproofâ. All proofs contain “the information to cryptographically verify a piece of data is anchored to a blockchain,â and prove that the data existed at the time it was anchored. âThe final Chainpoint proof defines a path of operations that cryptographically links your data to one or more blockchains,â the website explains. The current version of Chainpoint is 2.0. However, âthe third major version of the Chainpoint proof specification is currently in testing and scheduled for release soon,â its website states. The new version more than doubles the number of variables used to help developers customize Chainpointâs usage, including one which makes timestampsÂ human readable. Conflict reared its ugly head on Saturday when Chainpoint tweeted the news about its upcoming version 3 release. Peter Todd, the lead developer of competing standard Opentimestamps,Â replied: Although the two standards have been developed separately, Todd believes that Chainpointâs latest version âmostlyâ copies his projectâs code. âThe @chainpnt 3.0 beta spec is a translation of @opentimestamps to JSON-LD, with some terminology changed, and an odd branch label scheme,â Todd tweeted. Responding to Toddâs allegation, Tierion CEO and founder, Wayne Vaughan, fired back with the same accusation. He tweeted: âWhen you copied @chainpnt and didn’t acknowledge our work, I didn’t complain, we just kept building. Quit whining @petertoddbtc.â Vaughan, however, did not respond by press time when Todd asked for evidence of his derogatory claim. Opentimestamps was Toddâs first Bitcoin project. The project started in April 2011 with its earliest Git commits that date back to June 8, 2012. âOpentimestamps aims to be a standard format for blockchain timestamping. The format is flexible enough to be vendor and blockchain independent,â its website describes. Like many of the earliest Bitcoin timestamping applications, the Opentimestamps website offers a way for anyone to stamp and verify their own files on its front page for free. Chainpointâs website currently does not offer that functionality. Meanwhile, a peek at Chainpointâs code on Github reveals that it was made for the server environment only. A business using Chainpoint needs to only install the server software, which gives its customers access to the timestamping service. Its customers and business partners do not need to install a separate program. Opentimestamps, however, requires customers to install a program in order to access a businessâ timestamping service. Furthermore, Opentimestamps saves timestamps to the Bitcoin blockchain* whereas Chainpoint can also save to other blockchains. * Update: For Opentimestamps, the default calendars are Bitcoin-only but the underlying protocol has Ethereum support as well.

2017-04-15T08:00:15-04:00,"Ohio Inmates Built Computers Printing Passes, Accessing Tor and Bitcoin Wallets",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/ohio-inmates-built-computers-printing-passes-accessing-tor-and-bitcoin-wallets/,"On April 11, the U.S. state of Ohio Inspector General’s Office released a report about five prisoners accused of building two personal computers (PC) from spare parts within the prison. The inmates used the makeshift computers to access Tor, obtain credit cards, apply for bank accounts, and create bitcoin wallets as well. Also read: Drug Enforcement Officer From India Accused of Stealing Bitcoins Five inmates from the Marion Correctional Institution in Ohio built two computers from recycled computer parts and hid them in the prison ceiling. The jerry-rigged PCs were used for various cyber activities for well over two years within the prison facility. The Inspector General was notified of the incident when the prison’s IT team noticed peculiar activity while testing the facility’s server. Warnings included hacking alerts and proxy changes within the prison network. Furthermore, the prison’s IT specialists noticed the daily internet usage surpassed the typical average rate. The Ohio Inspector General states; Following the report, correctional officers removed two prison-built computers from the ceiling and charged five inmates with the crime. Officers also removed the two computers’ hard drives for further forensic data collection. Investigators found Pidgin chat accounts, visits to Tor sites, virtual phone software, and applications for credit cards. Additionally, officials found the inmates had created a system where they could issue prison passes that allowed them to roam the Marion Correctional Institution freely. The Ohio Inspector General then issued subpoenas to five banks that revealed credit card applications penned by a “Kyle Patrick.” In addition to the fraudulent credit card applications officers also discovered the crew utilized bitcoin wallet software as well. “It appears the Departmental Offender Tracking System (DOTS) portal was attacked and inmate passes were created,” explains the Ohio Inspector General’s report. The end result of the investigation saw the five ‘hacker inmates’ charged with building hidden computers and manipulating the prison’s server. All five prisoners were removed from the Marion Correctional Institution and placed in separate facilities. Going forward the Ohio Inspector General detailed the prison would “take any additional steps necessary to prevent these types of things from happening again.” What do you think about the five prisoners building computers and accessing credit cards and bitcoin wallets?

onto notary.bitcoin.com and upload a document. It will then be etched onto the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin.com notarized Satoshi Nakamoto’s white paper as its first document proof.  Also read: New Bitcoin.com Podcast Episode with Patrick Dugan of Bond Issuing Omni Notarization is a service that has previously been the province of government agencies. Governments monopolized this service to control people, but times have changed. The Bitcoin.com website says: Traditionally, people have wanted sensitive documents time-stamped and permanently verified for proof of ownership without assistance, and now the blockchain can assist with the same service. Certifying documents costs about 0.0050 BTC, or 6 dollars. The purpose of this action is to file a document on the
blockchain, and have a time-linked historical reference to it. Technically, a document can include government typified paperwork, high-pixel film, or even a region-marked photograph or piece of artwork. Bitcoin.com’s website put it this way, “A cryptographic digest of your document will be stored in the bitcoin blockchain, linking it to the time of submission. Your document could be anything, from an input-constrained form like conventional government documents to a full-resolution movie or location-stamped image.” Having a document trustlessly inscribed on the blockchain has several benefits. The primary benefit is that documents are backed on the blockchain in perpetuity. This means that the document’s footprint exists in cyberspace even if the physical copy vanishes. However, this also implies that the document stored will never be exposed. Its contents are not displayed via the blockchain. It is merely “dated” and cryptographically recorded, in which case its existence can be proven when necessary.

2017-04-14T15:00:01-04:00,"Like Gold, Bitcoin’s Cryptography Has Been Valued for Millennia",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/like-gold-bitcoins-cryptography-has-been-valued-for-millenia/,"When people debate the value of gold and bitcoin some often cite that gold has been valuable to humans for millennia. Yet people fail to realize that bitcoin’s backbone of cryptography has been valued for thousands of years as well. Also read:  A Visual Look at Bitcoin Growth and Demand So Far in 2017 One of the properties that makes bitcoin valuable is its use of strong cryptographic encryption methods. Cryptography is a very useful science and technology dating back to the Egyptian period of ca-1900 BCE. Archeologists discovered that Egyptians used a method of concealing information by utilizing cyphertext carved on a stone. In ancient times cryptography was used quite a bit in wars fought by many of the world’s armies and militant groups. The science was used in Greek classical times and during the Roman Empire as well. One of the most famous forms of concealing information using cryptography was the Caesar cipher which replaced letters with numbers that were tethered to a rearranged version of the alphabet. The art of cryptography has been a valuable piece of knowledge that is just as old as the value of precious metals like gold. The use of cryptography was also used during many revolutionary periods in human history. During the American Revolution leaders like Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin Franklin, and others used ciphers regularly. In the 1790’s Jefferson built a tool called the “wheel cipher” which used rotating wooden wheels with a marked alphabet. Devices like this were used by militaries all around the world leading up to World War I as Enigma cipher machines became famous during the early 30s and 40s. The computer era that utilized machine learning revolutionized the entire game of cryptography. In World War II cryptographic messages were used heavily by both sides of the battle and spurred the creation of Colossus, the world’s first programmable computer that cracked ciphers. In the seventies, the rise of open source research led to the creation of Whitfield Diffie and Martin Hellman’s public and private key scheme as well as the RSA algorithm. The discoveries during this decade are vital to Bitcoin as the network uses Diffie and Hellman’s symmetric cryptography as well as SHA-256, elliptic curve (ECDSA), and RIPEMD 160 cryptographic schemes. Open Bazaar developer Chris Pacia describes the encryption aspect of bitcoin quite well in his “Bitcoin Explained Like You’re Five” series stating;  Computational cryptography has enhanced the playing field for civilians as encryption is not just used exclusively by the military these days. After Diffie and Hellman introduced a new form of cryptography to the world, two published books became very popular among the masses—the Block Cipher, and the U.S. Data Encryption Standard.  In the late eighties, these ideas and the values of privacy-enhancing cryptography coalesced into movement of activists called the cypherpunks. During this time the cypherpunks read papers by cryptographer David Chaum, traded ideas via the Cypherpunks mailing list, and heard from visionaries like John Gilmore, Timothy C. May, and Eric Hughes. Nowadays millions of ordinary people place a lot of value in the art of cryptographic technology with messaging apps like Signal, email with PGP keys, and exchanging monetary value with cryptocurrency. The ideas of privacy-enhancing technologies like digital signatures, virtual currencies, and messaging systems backed by cryptography that was once envisioned by the cypherpunks during the dawn of the internet, have come to fruition.  This day in age people value cryptography for use in their everyday lives, and bitcoin is a great example of this fact. Shiny stones may have kept value for thousands of years, but cryptography has been valued for just as long.  Furthermore, cryptographic research has progressed, leading to stronger forms of private communications and the ability to share wealth in a censorship resistant way with bitcoin. And as time passes encryption techniques keep getting better, while gold never changes.  Cryptography is a remarkable human achievement and has given life to many of the technologies today; bitcoin is a prime example of these feats.

2017-04-14T14:30:55-04:00,Craig Wright-associated Nchain Claimed to Be Largest Acquisition in Bitcoin History,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/nchain-claimed-to-be-largest-acquisition-in-bitcoin-history/,"This week “blockchain technology-based research and development organization” Nchain has been acquired by the High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc. The company claims the transaction is the largest acquisition within the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry to date, but will not provide any evidence of this claim. Furthermore, the company owns patents from and has ties with Dr. Craig Wright, the Australian who has claimed to be Satoshi Nakamoto.   Also read: Craig Wright Wants to Kill Satoshi by Becoming Him…Again. Why? And How?  The blockchain company Nchain and its affiliated companies have announced it was recently acquired by the High Tech Private Equity Fund SICAV plc. The firm is a EU regulated investment fund managed by Accuro Fund Solutions. Not much more is known about who the owners or investors involved are, and questions towards this subject has so far remained unanswered.  The Nchain organization claims to be a group of companies with a team of over 60 scientific researchers, engineers, and other professionals based in Europe and Canada. According to the press release, the amount paid for the recent purchase of Nchain is undisclosed. However, sources familiar with the transaction say it was well over the capital injected into 21 Inc., making the claim that Nchain is the largest acquisition in the Bitcoin and blockchain development space yet. According to CNBC, a source familiar with the matter said that $300 million had been invested in Nchain, but it was not clear over what period of time. Neither was it clear in what form the investment was made; in dollars, bitcoin, equity? Requests to have Nchain deliver some sort of verification for these claims have gone unanswered. UPDATED: Nchain responded to these questions simply with the line; “Old fashioned cash in fiat currency.”, still not mentioning the actual sum transacted. The company says the venture will provide Nchain the ability to continue its research and development of distributed ledger technology and prepare blockchain development for global mass adoption. “While learning about the suite of Nchain’s capabilities through the acquisition, it became clear to me that we are in a new era of the digital age following the creation of the personal computer and the internet,” the Director of Nchain Holdings Limited, Arthur Davis stated in the announcement press release. “This changes everything leading us into what we at Nchain call the ‘Internet of Transactions.'” A Google search for Nchain did not turn up much useful, and browsing the website Nchain.com (or the similar Nchain.co) provides little clue as to what experience Nchain has with blockchain development. UPDATED: Arthur Davis sent news.Bitcoin.com this response on a question about what previous experience the firm has with blockchain development; “Zero customer facing activities to date. This is and will change over the next year. To date the Company has only been capturing the past close to a decade of research and development of those assets acquired from Dr. Wright’s businesses in Australia, and developing those assets and creating new intellectual property and assets, some of which have been flowing into patents. The press release marks the start of a major pivot in the business in this regard.” The site lists no team members, prior projects or clients. The whole web site consists of three pages, with only one news announcement. Still, the company press release claims it employs over 60. Questions on the matter sent to Nchain has so far gone unanswered. UPDATED: Bitcoin.com received an email response to this question the day after publication. Company representative Arthur Davis had this to say; “Regarding your question below the entire organization has kept a blanket is secrecy around its entire operation. Staff are not allowed to post on LinkedIn or to even have business cards historically. (This point you could reference). As part of coming out of stealth mode this policy of confidentiality will be considered and modified, however we have yet to determine exactly how. One fact which is public to which you could refer is Allan Pedersen who worked with CSW at DeMorgan in Australia. You can see this on companieshouse.co.uk which references the corporate Directors of nChain Limited our U.K. Subsidiary. Also mentioned there publicly is an executive Anthony Rowland.” Another interesting part of the acquisition story is Nchain’s relationship with the Australian scientist Craig Wright, who has claimed in the past he is Satoshi Nakamoto. According to the company, Craig Wright is employed as “Chief Scientist” with Nchain. Nchain, which was once called EITC Holdings, has claim over Wright’s Bitcoin and blockchain-based patents, an exclusive Reuters interview explains. However, Nchain details Wright does not have an ownership interest in the R&D company. Rather the patent holdings were purchased previously for, yet another, undisclosed sum. “Dr. Wright is not, nor has he ever been, a director or shareholder in the Nchain companies,” explains an email response from Nchain. “Dr. Wright has never invested in Nchain and has never had any ownership interest in Nchain. —  100% of the ownership stake in the Nchain business was sold. The Nchain business includes both Nchain Limited, a UK entity, and Nchain Holdings Limited, an Antiguan entity. — The intellectual property created by Nchain Limited is owned by Nchain Holdings Limited.” Nchain explains the company believes the legend of Satoshi Nakamoto “is and will always remain a myth.” The blockchain R&D organization says it plans to advance on-chain scaling “without degrading the benefits of decentralisation,” according to the press release. This includes developing a solution in “adherence to the original vision, removing the Bitcoin blockchain’s artificial block size limit (temporarily set at 1MB) to fuel increased scalability and usage,” Nchain states. The Nchain team has also detailed it will be advocating for a formation of a group focused on neutral standards in regards to the Bitcoin network’s development and technical standards. The organization believes this type of group could help manage protocol development to “ensure the long-term advancement of the Bitcoin blockchain.” With additional reporting by Nanok Bie.

2017-04-14T14:00:13-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin’s Battle Against the Bear Market,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoins-battle-bear-market/,"The fiat value of bitcoin has seen a decline over the past 24-hours as the price per BTC dropped from US$1215 to a low of $1140 across major global exchanges. At press time, the price is on the rebound hovering around the $1170-1180 range, but the market is showing no signs of fending off sellers. Also Read: Bitcoin: The Most Immutable Ledger of Them All Bears have taken over the price of bitcoin as the cryptocurrency’s market value is trending downwards. Bitcoin daily trade volume has also dropped to under $300 million worth of BTC trades. There hasn’t been any significant headlines pointing to the reason behind bitcoin’s price drop. At present markets look undecided, and a breakout is possible in any direction.  Some technical indicators suggest the current bear market may be short lived as the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is still above the 200 SMA trend line. Day traders and those who played ‘short’ positions are surely finding strategies in this current market setting. Even though the SMA shows a possible upside break, both the Relative Strength Indicator (RSI) and Stochastic readout shows the price may continue its downward slide. Order books across many major exchanges show sellers are indeed in control of the market and a drop below the 4-digit range is still entirely possible. Additionally, bitcoin’s market share dominance among competing altcoins has also dropped since our price report last week, which is currently resting at 67 percent. Ethereum’s market capitalization commands most of the remaining market share, and ether’s trade volume is roughly around half of bitcoin’s daily volume. The other altcoins in the cryptocurrency ecosystem also show price uncertainty. Ethereum’s ether token is priced at $47 after rising above $50 just 24-hours prior. Ethereum’s market capitalization is roughly $4.3 billion with a daily volume of $130 million worth of ether traded per day. Some suggest Ethereum’s recent price bump is attributed to the Raiden software being developed, which is basically the Ethereum version of the Lightning Network. Following Ethereum, Ripple’s (XRP) price has remained stable at three cents per XRP without any notable movements this week.     Litecoin has taken the number four position within the highest valued market caps in the top ten commanding roughly $500 million at press time. The price spike likely has to do with the upcoming Segwit implementation which could take place in just over two weeks. Dash has seemed to fend off sellers for the time being as the price has risen to $70 per token. The Dash rise is possibly due to the Kraken exchange listing the cryptocurrency within its markets. The rest of the top ten cryptocurrencies are more or less the same as last week which includes Monero, Ethereum Classic, NEM, Augur, and Maidsafecoin. All of these digital assets are experiencing slight dips at the moment, minus NEM which is up 2.5 percent. Another notable token possibly entering the crypto-top ten in the near future is PIVX which currently rests in the eleventh position. The token is very similar to the Dash infrastructure but claims to have no instamine, an alleged issue that has haunted Dash developers since the (Darkcoin) blockchain was created. Another week in the world of bitcoin has passed, and the cryptocurrency’s market value seems to be trying real hard to stay above the 4-digit price range. As of now, traders seem uncertain, but there hasn’t been any definitive reasoning behind the downturn and it may just be traders taking in profits. In the short term, some members of the Whale Club Telegram channel and Trading View traders claim the price may ‘short’ for the next 2-5 days. Bear Scenario: If bitcoin’s price keeps going down the value could drop below the $1100 mark and further escalate below the 4-digit range. At press time order books and depth charts show there is a strong floor around the $1125 price point. RSI and Stochastic trend lines demonstrate the price per BTC may be overbought and more corrections may come in the short-term. Bull Scenario: Charts also show ‘double bottom’ trendlines may bring the price back above $1200 in the near future. 100 and 200 SMA indicators show this might be the case as buyers could take control over the market quite easily. At the moment there are significant sell walls above the $1200 mark, and it will take some time to break through current resistance.    What do you think about Bitcoin’s price trends at the moment? Do you think global bitcoin markets will surpass $1,200 again? Or do you see the bear market continuing? Let us know in the comments below.

Here’s how to assess your vulnerability and what to do about it.  Also read: Bitcoin Gamblers Have Wagered $4.5 Billion in BTC Since 2014 “Vault7” is Wikileaks’ codename for a series of massive document releases on the e-surveillance and cyber-warfare techniques of the CIA. It is not known how many releases will occur but four have so far. “Year Zero” is the most interesting to Bitcoin users because it documents proximate dangers. “Grasshopper” is also important to examine. This Wikileaks dump reiterated something we already knew; Our devices are fundamentally unsafe. No matter what kind of encryption we use, no matter which secure messaging apps we take care to run, no matter how careful we are to sign up for two-factor authentication, the CIA—and, we have to assume, other hackers—can infiltrate our operating systems, take control of our cameras and microphones, and bend our phones to their will. The same can be said of smart TVs, which could be made to surreptitiously record our living-room conversations. Consider just three. Smartphones Reason magazine states the danger simply. “According to Wikileaks, the documents show the CIA has a specialized unit specifically for stealing data from Apple products like the Iphone and the Ipad, and another unit for Google’s Android mobile operating system. These units create malware based on ‘zero- day’ exploits that the companies that develop the compromised systems are not aware of.” PC Backdoors CIA can reputedly infect computers which run on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7. Mac OS or Linux – those are reported to be affected as well. Weeping Angel C/net reports that Weeping Angel is an “alleged spying tool, co-developed by the CIA and the UK’s MI5 security agency, which lets a Samsung Smart TV (specifically, the F8000 Smart TV) pretend to turn itself off — and record your conversations — when you’re not using the screen.” Although there is evidence of development since 2014, there is no hard evidence of completion. Note: Samsung drew sharp criticism in 2015 when its smart TVs were shown to be recording private conversations. Weeping Angel may not affect Bitcoin use directly but it demonstrates the pervasive surveillance being pursued by the CIA. Most people will not be targeted by the CIA or even by government agencies with which the hacking tools may have been shared, like the IRS. But the CIA seems to have lost control of their own tools including weaponized viruses, malware, and trojans. The tools, code, and strategies apparently circulated freely among former contractors and hackers for the U.S. government, who were not authorized to view them. NBC News reported on an interview with Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. “Assange ridiculed the CIA for failing to guard information about its online arsenal, allowing it to be passed around within the intelligence community. That is how the material ended up in Wikileaks’ hands ─ and, possibly, criminals’, he said.” Wikileaks has “held off publishing viruses and other weapons”; it has delayed publication in order to first “disarm” the tools. You should assume that weaponized hacking tools are in private hands. The CIA may not consider you “worthy” of targeting but criminals are less discriminating. Stay safe out there.

South Korea was one of the targets, but not the only one. Also read: Why South Korean Bitcoin Adoption Could Outpace Most Other Countries This Year Radio Free Asia (RFA) is a private, nonprofit international broadcasting corporation based in the US. The publication reported on Wednesday that North Korean hackers stole more than 100 million won worth of bitcoin, approximately US$88,000, each month from 2013 to 2015. Choi Sang-Myong is a senior official at South Korea’s cybersecurity firm Hauri Inc. He told the publication, as translated by South Korea’s largest news agency Yonhap, that: The relations between North and South Korea became extremely strained in 2013, during the Korean Crisis, when North Korea blocked access to the Kaesong Industrial Region for all South Korean citizens. Both countries agreed to reopen the industrial park four months later, but tensions stayed on edge in the meantime. According to Choi, the bitcoin thefts targeting South Korea began during the two weeks that followed the shutdown of the Kaesong industrial park that year. North Korean hackers soon stole about 40 million won worth of bitcoin from South Korea at the time, Choi revealed, but noted that the country has not been the only target. He added: While Choi confirmed North Korea’s bitcoin theft activities up to 2015, he speculated that the hackers involved may have moved onto other more profitable fields thereafter. Besides the hackers, there have not been many reports of Bitcoin users in North Korea, due to their totalitarian internet policy that limits access to a handful of elites and scientists. However, in January 2014, the first claimed Bitcoin transaction was sent from North Korea, for the amount of 0.1037 btc to Sean’s Outpost, a homeless shelter in Pensacola, Florida. Using the discontinued Changetip app, Reddit user Bitcoindprk proved that he was on a tour in North Korea and sent $100 at the time to the famous Bitcoiner’s charity, run by Jason King. In doing so, the nameless Redditor demonstrated that Bitcoin truly has no borders. Admitting that it would be a few years until the locals would even get access to the internet, he also claimed that he had been handing out paper wallets “with a few mbtc each to the Korean guides” who accompanied him on the tour.

2017-04-13T15:30:31-04:00,Microsoft Office Software Gets a Bitcoin Blockchain Certification Upgrade,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/microsoft-office-bitcoin-blockchain-upgrade/,"Microsoft Office users can now create immutable documents with help from the Bitcoin blockchain. On April 10 a blockchain document certification and verification application called Stampery was added to the multinational tech giant’s Microsoft Office program. Also read: Skeptics Show Concern as UASF Gains a Following Microsoft has shown support for Bitcoin-related applications for quite some time. Now a company engineer, Ville Rantala has announced the implementation of the Stampery blockchain add-in for it’s Microsoft Office suite. Essentially users can certify and verify documents using either the Bitcoin or Ethereum blockchain. Microsoft’s engineer believes enterprise organizations and individuals need to record and secure important documents every day. Immutable certification and verification are crucial to the integrity of legal documents and contracts that cannot be manipulated, Rantala details. “An alternative to relying on a single entity (commercial, public, government, etc.) to keep such proof of identity safe is to create a hash of the document and send that hash to the publicly accessible blockchain, such as Bitcoin,” Microsoft’s Senior Engineer Rantala explains. “Once the hash data is present on the public blockchain, the document can’t be changed without invalidating the hash. This approach guarantees both the document’s privacy and the data’s availability for future validation purposes.” Microsoft’s Rantala says they utilized a secure API to introduce the Stampery add-in to Microsoft Office and Outlook without leaving the program. This means the add-in blockchain certification and verification buttons can be found in the software’s toolbar. The engineer’s blog post details how the process works within the platform’s user interface; Rantala believes adding Stampery to the Office platform will enable users to employ a more secure method of document storage. Furthermore, the tech company’s engineer thinks enterprise customers will find the feature very useful as the application can ensure the validity of important business documentation. Created in 1988 Microsoft Office is one of the most popular word processing software suites utilized in office and business settings worldwide. The code for the Stampery Office add-in is open source, and the protocol can be reviewed on Github. “Users should be able to see that documents sent to them are signed or stamped, then verified or notarized,” explains Rantala.

Civic also mentions that its architecture is constructed on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, which is based on a distributed ledger technology. This means that the company employs real-time, time-stamped verification for its identity product. Civic describes this activity as a firewall between civic and the user’s identity. A tech crunch article provided further information on how the network functions, saying, “This system is made possible through Civic’s Identity Protection Network, which will be a network of businesses who collect users’ personal data, including their SSN. This network could include members like banks, financial services, healthcare organizations or any other company that asks for your SSN. Consumers will be alerted when their SSN is used by a Civic partner.” They refer to their type of blockchain-based ID security on their Identity Protection Network as “evolving authentication.” When users sign up to the platform, they are allowed to authenticate their identification and use different signatory defenses to prevent nefarious actors from accessing personal credentials. The Civic Website says: Civic wants people to use their service so they can secure their personal identification on the blockchain and protect themselves from hackers and other criminal activity. According to Civic’s website, they are also teaming up with Intel in order to provide extra security.
 The startup believes this is an exciting innovation using blockchain technology and Software Guard Extensions together. According to Intel, SGX is a codex of new instructions that can be used by applications to segregate private sets of data. This denotes credentials that can be stored and authenticated without having them loosely floating around in physical form or unprotected on the internet. Lingham’s company further states that they offer (SPS) secure private sign up and (SPL) secure private logon via the civic application.

Over the past two months, withdrawals have been suspended across nearly every major Chinese bitcoin trading platform with no word on when suspensions will be lifted. Also read: Japan Declares Sale of Bitcoin Exempt from Consumption Tax 2017 has seen quite the shakeup in regards to Chinese bitcoin exchanges as each company has been facing the regulatory wrath of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC). Ongoing inspections and discussions have led to stricter AML/KYC regulation, and Chinese traders have not been able to withdraw bitcoins for over two months. Chinese trading platforms have also revealed new types of KYC verification processes like on-site validation and remote video identification. This week the Chinese exchange Okcoin has revealed the platform is upgrading to a multi-signature withdrawal system but has not detailed when the company will lift the suspension. After April 23rd the company’s customers will be using a multi-signature controlled wallet for bitcoin and litecoin holdings. The other two top bitcoin exchanges in China, Huobi and BTCC have recently told the public that all bitcoin exchanges in China are adhering to new regulatory policies and withdrawals should commence after the upgrades are finished. Huobi explains in their most recent announcement stating; A recent report has also detailed that young bitcoin traders in China have been making a lucrative living trading the decentralized cryptocurrency. For instance, Huai Yang, a 27-year old living in Beijing says he is making 1m yuan per month trading bitcoins. Yang has been involved with cryptocurrency for quite some time but has been trading bitcoin for a living over the past six months. “I want a more splendid life,” explains the Chinese bitcoin trader.   Another Chinese trader named Chenxing explains how he quit his government engineering job to trade bitcoin this year. During a good month, Chenxing pockets about five BTC but quickly converts it to yuan. Chenxing details the bitcoin environment in Beijing is growing, and he expects the cryptocurrency phenomenon to continue to prosper in China. The Chinese traders highlighted in the report didn’t seem too concerned with the PBOC’s recent regulatory actions. Meanwhile, Bitcoin proponents have noticed a significant influx of traders moving to over-the-counter (OTC) and peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms like Localbitcoins. The P2P trading platform continues to see record volumes within the country. However, some Chinese traders have been afraid of police investigations and fraudsters on Localbitcoins.

2017-04-12T04:00:50-04:00,How Big is Bitcoin?,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-big-is-bitcoin/,"Recently Bitcoin.com reported on the release of a comprehensive cryptocurrency study by the University of Cambridge. One area discussed in this report is the number of users of cryptocurrencies and wallets. This article explores how the study derives the number of active Bitcoin users and holders. Also read: Lots of Data in Cambridge University’s First ‘Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study’ Twenty-six wallet providers participated in the survey, including Airbitz, Armory, Bitgo, Blockchain, Coinbase, Greenaddress, Ledger, Jaxx, Mycelium, Samourai, and Xapo. The study defines a wallet provider as “any volunteer project or company that provides a standalone wallet that anyone can use.” First, the total number of wallets is estimated using data collected from study participants, in addition to “the number of software downloads of major wallet providers and Bitcoin’s reference implementation.” The estimate represents all cryptocurrency wallets, not just Bitcoin. While citing “a potentially infinite number of wallets could be created from a single software download,” the study uses a conservative assumption that one software download equals one wallet created. Some numbers are unavailable and therefore omitted such as the number of downloads for some open-source wallets, resulting in a “lower bound” estimate. Overall, the report’s authors wrote: Second, the number of active cryptocurrency wallets is calculated from the total number of wallets. The report notes that estimating the number of active wallets poses a challenge, since publicly reported wallet numbers do not reflect whether or not they are active. In addition, the definition of “active” varies for different wallet providers. The study, therefore, uses data obtained from survey participants to estimate the number of active wallets instead. This data “suggests that the number of active wallets ranges from 7.5% to 30.9% of the total number of wallets,” the report reveals, adding that: Third, the study conservatively derives the number of cryptocurrency wallet users from the number of active wallets, using the assumption that a user holds two wallets on average. Some types of wallet users are also unaccounted for in the study, such as those using exchange accounts as their de facto wallet, or those using payment service providers or platforms that can store cryptocurrencies. “The total number of active cryptocurrency users is likely considerably higher than our estimate of unique active wallet users,” the report’s authors wrote, noting that:  Finally, the researchers attempt to find the number of cryptocurrency users and holders. However, they admit that “estimating both the number of cryptocurrency holders and users is a difficult endeavor as individuals can use multiple wallets from several providers at the same time.” In addition, the authors explain how one user may also use different wallets for different cryptocurrencies and be counted multiple times. “Many individuals are using centralised wallet, exchange or payment platforms that pool funds together into a limited number of large wallets or addresses, which further complicates the picture,” they further detail. “It is impossible to know precisely how many people use cryptocurrency.” Without deriving their own numbers, the authors reference external estimates. The first, but a rather outdated one, is by the Boston Federal Reserve in a 2016 report. It states that 0.87% of U.S. consumers had adopted cryptocurrencies in 2015, which “amounts to around 2.8 million people in the US alone,” the Cambridge authors relay. A more recent estimate mentioned is an independent research by Coinbase and ARK Invest Research, which covers only bitcoin instead of all cryptocurrencies. In their January report, they wrote: What do you think of these estimates? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-04-11T18:00:48-04:00,Bitcoin Gamblers Have Wagered $4.5 Billion in BTC Since 2014,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-gamblers-wagered-4-5-billion-btc-2014/,"Bitcoin gambling has continued to rise in popularity over the years. Many people believe Bitcoin is the perfect currency for online wagers and cryptocurrency-based gambling statistics have shown that the market agrees. Also read: Lucky Week at Bitcoin Games Roulette Table as Players Win 154 BTC It is clear that Bitcoin gambling is just one of many excellent platforms that demonstrates the cryptocurrency’s real-world use cases. Using bitcoin has allowed for more privacy-centric gambling, alongside quicker ways to fund casino accounts, pay out jackpots and reward players. Online gambling is a huge industry with a volume of $45.86 billion in 2016 and Bitcoin has captured just a tiny fraction of this market so far. Nonetheless, the use of Bitcoin at online casinos has steadily risen every year with many people placing their bets with cryptocurrency daily. Bitcoin gambling has been around since the currency’s inception and in 2013 Bitcoin betting accounted for over 50 percent of all Bitcoin transactions. A research report released that year detailed “online gambling represents at least 10x the transaction volume of Silk Road and the other Bitcoin drug marketplaces.” According to the Bitcoin Strip, a website that tracks online Bitcoin casino statistics, over 24.5 billion bets have been placed with bitcoins over the past two years. In 2017, the popularity of Bitcoin gambling continues to grow as there are now hundreds of cryptocurrency gaming destinations on the web. According to statistics throughout sixty cryptocurrency-based gambling sites, people are placing 337 bets per second and are wagering three BTC per minute. Moreover, since 2014, roughly 3.7 million BTC has been wagered equating to $4.5 billion USD at the time of writing. Last month a domain called “bitcoin.casino’ sold for a record sale of $28,000 for the .casino extension portal. A Florida-based firm called Casino Holdings bought the bitcoin.casino domain and the website hosts reviews of Bitcoin gambling sites found online. According to statistics, searches for .casino domain extensions have been on the rise this year. Furthermore, Bitcoin based casino-style gaming sites have been selling like hot cakes for quite some time. Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees sold his website, Satoshi Dice, for over $11.5 million (126,315 BTC) back in 2013. Bitcoin and online gambling has increased in nearly every country in the world bar the U.S., Russia and a few other regions. Currently the U.S. has significant regulatory policies against online gambling in general throughout the country. Most of the restrictions stem from the Unlawful Internet Gaming Enforcement Act (UIGEA) that was created back in 2006. According to the act, the UIGEA “prohibits gambling businesses from knowingly accepting payments in connection with the participation of another person in a bet or wager that involves the use of the Internet and that is unlawful under any federal or state law.” As a result the vast majority of Bitcoin casinos and cryptocurrency wagering sites refuse to operate in the U.S. to this day. Using Bitcoin to play classic casino games such as blackjack, roulette, dice and more will likely continue to increase as statistics have shown. Some residents from countries with stricter regulation may not be able to participate, but many other regions are seeing a lot of growth in the gambling market.  Regardless of regulation issues, cryptocurrency gambling continues to rise every year, and 2017 is no different. Three bitcoins gambled per minute over the past two years shows cryptocurrency and online wagers are working quite well together. What do you think about bitcoin and gambling?

Also read: How Japan Prepares to Recognize Bitcoin as Method of Payment on April 1 The Bank of Russia is considering regulating cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin as a tool to combat money laundering, Bloomberg reported. Moiseev said in an interview: The central bank is developing a joint position on digital currencies together with the government. “The plan to legalize and monitor Bitcoin is taking shape as traditional schemes are drying up,” according to the publication, citing non-cryptocurrency methods of “dubious operations such as fake trades and loans used to move money abroad dropping by half to $771 million last year, according to central bank data.” Russia has gone through several periods of alternating appreciation for and conflict against Bitcoin, even considering an outright ban of cryptocurrency in the country punishable by jail time for holding bitcoins. In February 2014, Russian authorities issued warnings against using Bitcoin that cite how it could be used for money laundering or financing terrorism, adding that treating it like a currency is illegal. Last May, Russia’s central bank revealed its plans to create their own digital currency, while once again considering banning others including bitcoin. That December, however, a federal tax service letter implied that cryptocurrencies are not illegal but its status was unclear. Moiseev himself has also sent mixed messages regarding Bitcoin in the past. Last summer, he considered Bitcoin mining illegal while taking the stance that bitcoin could be traded similar to foreign exchange (forex) markets. Then, in January, he stated that he did not view Bitcoin as a threat. In February, Bank of Russia Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said that the authorities would decide if digital currencies can be considered an asset, cash or security by mid-2017. Meanwhile, bitcoin trading volume in Russia is on the rise at Localbitcoins. Last week over 342 million rubles, worth roughly US$6 million, were traded for bitcoins on this exchange alone.

2017-04-11T06:00:17-04:00,When It Comes to Scarcity and Anti-Counterfeiting Bitcoin Actually Outshines Gold,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/scarcity-anti-counterfeiting-bitcoin-outshines-gold/,"Some people believe the properties of precious metals like gold far exceed the fundamental attributes of Bitcoin. Over the years, many have claimed that gold is scarce and is hard to counterfeit. However, there have been cases that have proven gold is not as scarce as we think and the soft metal is often substituted with phony imitations. Also read: Japan Declares Sale of Bitcoin Exempt from Consumption Tax One of the most valued properties of Bitcoin is the cryptocurrency’s capped supply at 21 million units. Scarcity is believed to be a valuable trait to humans as economists believe this attribute fends off market behaviors like inflation. Most people consider precious metals like gold and silver to be a scarce commodity within our world. However, over the years it has become more apparent that gold’s scarcity may be somewhat of a falsehood. For instance, scientists have found there are vast amounts of mineral elements in space, specifically in asteroids. Asteroid mining, which mines raw material from floating space rocks, is a legitimate venture that will likely take place in the near future. The practice will enable people to mine and transport gold, silver, iridium, palladium, and platinum back to earth. However at the moment this process is expensive and could cost billions just to get started, but the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx is just one of many projects working on this goal. One asteroid can hold hundreds of thousands of kilograms of gold, depending on size. Google’s Planetary Resources also plans to mine asteroids.  On earth, there may be even more gold than we think, for instance under the ocean floor and new mining locations are found every few years. Just the other week, on March 29, over 382 tons of gold were found in Shandong China. Reports state that the mine’s value is estimated to be over $22 billion (RMB150billion), which in itself is larger than Bitcoin’s current market capitalization. Reports reveal the mine is one of the largest gold reserves ever found in China and the potential excavation can be finished in only two years. It is a known fact that Bitcoin cannot be duplicated or counterfeited. The network will not accept a forged bitcoin and will reject anyone trying to double-spend any unit in this capped supply. Gold proponents will also tell you the precious metal is also hard to counterfeit. Just recently, in Edmonton Canada, local law enforcement officials issued a warning to the public about a potential fake gold bar scam. Various merchants in Edmonton purchased fake bars last year, that investigators reported to be “professionally packaged and authentic.” “We tested the product for authenticity and quickly determined these gold bars were nothing more than copper bars plated in gold,” explained EPS Criminal Investigation Officer Robert Wellon. Furthermore, last month, investigators in China revealed an ongoing investigation in which they discovered a fake gold operation stemming from the Boyuan Mining company. The knockoff gold bricks allegedly scammed investors and financial institutions out of 11 billion CNY. Moreover, the gold was used to secure mortgages and pledge loans from the People’s Bank of China and Shanxi Province Rural Credit Cooperatives. Using gold as collateral for loans and real estate deals is common in China. Suspects used 62 percent tungsten in the forged bars, but the outer shells were solid gold. It is clear that gold’s scarcity and anti-counterfeiting claims are a bit misleading. On the other hand, Bitcoin will never have more than a 21 million capped supply, and forgery is extremely hard to accomplish within the Bitcoin network. Furthermore, the number of bitcoins in existence is far scarcer than we think due to losses, thefts, and concepts like proof-of-burn. The attributes of sound money, as far as scarcity and counterfeiting are concerned, is superior with Bitcoin in comparison to precious metals like gold. Furthermore, when it comes to sound money, Bitcoin also excels with its aspects of divisibility, portability, and durability.

Also read: Lots of Data in Cambridge University’s First ‘Global Cryptocurrency Benchmarking Study’ Discovered in August last year by white-hat security research group Malwaremustdie, Mirai turns networked devices running on out of date versions of Linux into remotely controlled “bots” or “zombies”, for use in DDoS attacks. “The Mirai botnet was developed for two primary purposes,” explained Dave Mcmillen, Senior Threat Researcher at IBM Managed Security Services. The first is to identify and compromise IoT devices to grow the botnet, and the second is to perform DDoS attacks against predefined targets, he detailed. X-Force is IBM’s threat intelligent and security research unit which provides actionable threat intelligence and insights for business and IT leaders. In January, a Windows botnet spreading a Mirai bot variant was discovered. “But this Windows bot is not new,” wrote Kaspersky Lab’s global research team. “The Windows bot’s spreading method for Mirai is very limited as well – it only delivers the Mirai bots to a Linux host from a Windows host if it successfully brute forces a remote telnet connection.” Nonetheless, Kaspersky Lab’s data shows that 500 unique systems had already been attacked as of this February. Kurt Baumgartner, Kaspersky Lab principal security research, said: Last week, IBM X-Force uncovered “a new variant of the ELF Linux/Mirai malware that has a new twist: a built-in Bitcoin mining component,” Mcmillen wrote. The Mirai with Bitcoin mining attack began on March 20 and spiked on March 25, but the activity “subsided eight days after it began.”  “We did not find any evidence to indicate why this attack was short-lived, however seeing campaigns with a short lifecycle such as this is common,” Mcmillen told Eweek publication. In addition, “the Bitcoin client was not embedded into the Mirai malware itself. Rather, the Bitcoin miner was part of an archive of files that contained a Mirai dropper, a Dofloo backdoor, a Linux shell, and a Bitcoin miner slave,” the publication explained. While much about the attackers are currently unknown, Mcmillen confirmed to the publication that “the majority of the attack activity came from the Asia-Pacific region, and the language interface does suggest that the attack could have originated from a Chinese-language source.” Mcmillen also revealed: “We do not have any insight into whether or not bitcoins were actually mined during these attacks.” Citing how more work needs to be done to determine the new variant’s capability, he wrote: “Addressing the IoT botnet phenomenon is going to require all stakeholders to take steps to secure these devices,” Mcmillen noted. “If the weaponization of IoT devices into DDoS botnets is the latest malicious trend, then turning them into Bitcoin miners may be just around the corner,” he concluded.

People still have faith in digital gold.  Also read: Mexico’s New Bill Could Be a Game Changer for Bitcoin Nonetheless, this seems like an unprecedented rise in price. The community is still immersed in the tumultuous challenge of finding a solution to the block size dilemma. Some would think the resultant FUD would have caused investors to dump their holdings, inspiring a downward trend in price. The reverse is true, though: there has been healthy bitcoin trading on the market at the onset of April. A Crypto-Time article pointed out that the growth of Bitcoin this month coincided with marked “profits” in the Bitcoin space, which garnered attention of more speculators and investors. This would make sense from a nontechnical perspective. Some investors may not understand all intricacies of Bitcoin. They might take risks without having full mechanical acumen of the cryptocurrency. With that said, market actors with knowledge of Bitcoin are still trading, keeping, or hoarding the currency. If they would have thrown in the towel, the price would have started a downward spiral. This means that people still have faith the block size problem can be resolved without incident. In addition, the price hike also comes on the heels of the downward trend spurred by SEC refusal to list a bitcoin exchange-traded fund, meaning that market actors aren’t concerned about political action either. There is also other good news in the Bitcoin space. Even though the scaling debacle has caused some people to shake in their boots, there is more evidence that faith remains in Bitcoin. On March 2, Razor-Forex.com penned an article that suggested Bitcoin ATM installations are still on the rise, and that coinatmradar.com reported that 53 new ATM machines were installed in a variety of different countries in March. However, Razor-Forex added: Between a plethora of Bitcoin ATM’s being installed and the increasing price of Bitcoin, the digital currency is poised to continue its growth. Even though the community is in the midst of a veritable technical street fight—attempting to gouge each other’s eyes out—the market shows signs of a ferocious bull market. This means faith in the community is alive and well. It means people have enough respect for the Bitcoin geeks, gumshoes, hackers, experts, developers, and Jedi’s to come together and peaceably iron out political differences.

2017-04-10T17:00:08-04:00,Drug Enforcement Officer From India Accused of Stealing Bitcoins,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/drug-enforcement-officer-india-stealing-bitcoins/,"This week an Indian-Narcotics Control Bureau officer has been charged with stealing bitcoins from a darknet investigation.  Also read: Bitfinex Sues Wells Fargo Over Wire Transfer Suspension Over the past few years, law enforcement in India has been investigating darknet marketplace usage within the country. There have been multiple reports of the India-based Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB) busting high-level vendors operating on the deep web. The NCB has been involved with one particular darknet investigation since 2015. Now much like the scandal that took place in the Silk Road investigation with Carl Force and Sean Bridges, India’s narcotics agency is facing similar controversy. NCB officials are under scrutiny as an investigator from the agency is accused of misappropriating seized bitcoins. According to regional reports, officer Satyendra Kumar Singh collaborated with a group of accused darknet vendors and stole seized bitcoins from the agency’s confiscation. The NCB had arrested the organized group from Surat back in 2015 for trafficking prescribed anti-depressants and stimulants. Following the arrest, the alleged darknet vendors were released on bail and caught receiving funds from officer Singh. India’s crime branch stated: The forged NCB letters were used to demand 420 bitcoins be sent to officer Singh. Prosecutors say that Singh then dispersed the funds to all the individuals on bail and was allegedly allowed to keep half of the seized bitcoins for his participation. According to investigators, Singh was bribed by Deepak Mangukiya, one of the accused drug traffickers. Officer Singh has since been suspended from the NCB taskforce and has been officially charged by India’s crime branch. Singh and Mangukiya have also been detained, and prosecutors say further investigations involving Singh’s part in the crime will continue. “A team led by inspector S R Tandel was given investigation of the case. Singh and Mangukiya have been arrested and remain secured up to April 13. The investigation will focus on the transactions and Singh’s role,” explained a senior crime branch official. The news of a high-level Indian NCB officer accused of misappropriating funds follows India’s finance minister’s’ recent warnings against the virtual currency.

2017-04-10T12:00:07-04:00,Things to Consider When Starting a Bitcoin Mining Operation,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/things-consider-starting-bitcoin-mining-operation/,"Bitcoin mining has become a competitive industry within the cryptocurrency economy. With all the large data facilities and pools these days people often wonder what it takes to get involved with mining. Also Read: Bitcoin Mining: A Closer Look Under the Hood Many people are interested in mining bitcoins from home, but these days it’s become increasingly harder for home-based miners to make a profit. In order for an individual to join the mining environment, they need to figure out if it is worth it by calculating a bunch of different factors. Then they must either build a machine capable of mining or purchase a pre-built mining rig to join this aggressively competitive sector. The first thing people need to do is check a few statistics. This includes the mining hardware’s hashrate execution, the Bitcoin network’s current difficulty, and the electrical costs associated with a mining device. These steps are needed to assess the performance of a custom built or purchased a mining computer. Building custom mining rigs are slowly becoming a dying art as pre-assembled mining computers with Application-Specific Integrated Circuitry (ASIC) have become a dominant force within the industry. Hashrate A pre-built mining device from a well-known manufacturer will give you the details of the machines hashrate execution or the speed at which the device can perform mining calculations. Device performance is typically measured in terahashes for every calculation solved per second. This statistic can be measured against the current bitcoin difficulty [the calculation of how difficult it is to find a hash] which can give a person a rough idea if their machine performs well. Mining difficulty changes every 2016 blocks and the current network difficulty is 460,769,358,091 at the time of writing.  Electricity Mining also includes the cost of electrical consumption. Unless someone is stealing or getting free electricity, the cost to power a mining rig always comes into play. In order to figure out a machines return on investment (ROI) miners must divide the hash execution performance by the number of electrical watts consumed. Large mining facilities have found ways to offset electrical costs by utilizing more different types of resources such as hydropower and geothermal power. Electric power has different costs depending on where you live, for instance, the U.S. the average people pay is roughly 12 cents per kilowatt-hour. In other areas around the world, electricity is cheaper particularly in regions like China, and India. Device Cost Another calculation to figure into the equation is the cost to acquire a mining device. Pre-manufactured mining rigs can be anywhere from US$500 to $2,000 depending on performance and if the device is new or used. To get ahead of your original investment you have to mine enough bitcoins to cover the price of a machine and only after meeting this cost a person then can profit. Other things to consider are buying racks for multiple machines, connectors to tether all of the miners together in unison, and keeping capital handy for replacement parts.     Time and Maintenance Bitcoin mining also takes time to set up the machines and maintain them. Also just like any computer that operates consistently, factory parts can malfunction, and bitcoin miners often need fan replacements because devices run so hot. Additionally, it helps to be computer savvy and know how to use software, command lines, and be able to configure wiring and replacement parts. Larger data facilities hire employees to take care of thousands of machines running 24-hours a day.        Currently, there are only a few dedicated mining rig manufacturers that produce mining rigs. The two most popular mining rigs available in 2017 from the Bitmain Antminer brand include the R4 home miner and the S9 series. Both machines consume roughly 845-1375 watts and calculate hash solving at 8.6-12.9 terahashes per second (TH/s).  Furthermore, this past November another mining device manufacturer Canaan announced the launch of the Avalon 721 ROQ Solid Miner. The latest release from Avalon uses custom 16 nm ASIC chips and what the firm calls a “Smart Layout.” The Avalon 721 operates at six TH/s and uses 900-1200 watts while operating. Avalon also boasts an open source repository for its mining software.    People can also build their own custom mining rigs or assemble a data station using devices and parts from multiple companies. Parts to make a homemade rig and mining machines made by a manufacturing company are in high demand and can be expensive. Anyone can estimate a mining ROI with variables given from the machine’s performance and today’s bitcoin difficulty statistics. There are also calculators on the web that can assess the performance of a miner and estimate an ROI. However, every day after the ROI timeframe will be different due to increases in electrical cost, and changes to the network’s mining difficulty. Getting into the bitcoin mining game isn’t easy, and it can be difficult meeting the original investment. For some machines, it could take a year or longer to get an ROI with today’s difficulty. Moreover, machines have to be maintained and being technically savvy can help a great deal as there are a lot more variables to deal with when beginning to mine bitcoins. A lot of people say that individual mining isn’t worth it these days so many people join pools to better their chances at reward. Furthermore, some people mine just to help support the network and participate because it can be a fun hobby. Whatever the case may be preparing to mine bitcoins is a bit more complicated than it used to be. What do you think about individual and home mining? Do you think it is still profitable?

2017-04-08T12:00:57-04:00,Bitcoiners Resort to Jerry-Rigged Solutions to Send Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoiners-jerry-rigged-solutions-send-bitcoin/,"Over the past few months, many people have been talking heavily about the Bitcoin network’s backlog of unconfirmed transactions and higher fees. Unfortunately, the community at large hasn’t figured out the best solutions to tackle these issues. However recently many bitcoiners are resorting to different ‘jerry-rigged’ ways to overcome the current obstacles of steep miner fees and lagging transactions. Also read: Japan Declares Sale of Bitcoin Exempt from Consumption Tax Lately, there has been quite a bit of focus on the scaling debate, and much of the discussion resonates with Bitcoin’s transaction rate and miner fees. Fees, for instance, are always varying and lately, people have been paying upwards of $1-1.50 per transaction. For now, a great majority of people have been resorting to looking at websites like 21 inc’s average fee converter to calculate the fees for the transactions they send. However, there are also other methods people have been using to not only pay lower fees, but also get their transactions confirmed more quickly. Just as a lot of people refer to fee websites these days bitcoiners are also looking at the mempool count and visualizing the number of transactions waiting to be processed. Many have found over the past few months that particularly on Saturdays and Sundays, the amount of unconfirmed transactions in the queue are far lower than on the weekdays. People have figured out and are now discussing the best time frames to send bitcoins in order to get faster confirmations. People have also found out that during the times when there isn’t much backlog the high fee your wallet recommends for a transaction may not be necessary. Lower fees paid to miners when the transaction queue is relatively low will likely be confirmed just as fast without paying a high rate. This could mean paying 10-15 cents per transaction as opposed to a dollar if the timing is right, but it’s not a guaranteed science. Another way people have improvised is by accepting zero confirmations when dealing with bitcoin transactions. The practice is considered risky to some who believe accepting zero confirms may lead to more frequent acts of fraud. However over the past year or so since the backlog started getting bad, various merchants announced they had been accepting zero confirmations. Some have advocated the practice is completely safe by saying cheating doesn’t happen very often. One particular forum post called “Why bitcoin zero confirmation transactions are safe” illustrates one company’s example.     “My present business is a busy bar and restaurant in a developing country. We operate a tab system for every customer. A customer could easily just walk off and not pay the tab. We serve over 2,000 customers a day, but this happens less than 0.00001% of the time.” Just last week, another business called SMS Privacy got a well-received response when developer James Stanley announced his company was accepting zero confirmation payments. Stanley details that his customers were “frustrated with long confirmation times” and even with one confirmation, some transactions could take a while. “Instead of sending money and being able to use the service immediately, customers sometimes had to wait hours,” explains Stanley. This is immensely frustrating for a legitimate customer: you’ve sent the money, you’re not trying to steal anything, why do you have to wait?” Stanley started his experiment over a month ago and has seen zero instances of double-spends and all of his customers are anonymous. Slow confirmation times have also produced new services called transaction accelerators. A couple of mining pools have come up with a way to prioritize transactions, which essentially claims to increase the chance of a transaction confirmation. Users simply submit the TXID to the service and wait to see if the pool finds the transaction in the next block they find. The method is currently being offered by two mining pools at the moment BTC.com and Viabtc. BTC.com’s service users have to pay for and can use a credit card if they desire. Viabtc’s service is free but requires the transaction to have a minimum fee of 0.0001BTC/KB. Accelerators are still rudimentary and users still may have to wait a few hours before getting a confirmation.  The makeshift methods people are using to bypass slow transaction times and high fees will be a reality until the scaling issue is resolved. The jerry-rigged techniques mentioned above are not perfect by any means. There still could be a considerable wait time for bitcoins sent with a fee that’s too low and accepting a zero confirmation transaction could lead to fraud. For now, people are trying different makeshift methods to bypass the Bitcoin network’s congestion and high fees.

2017-04-08T06:00:48-04:00,Media Frenzy in Japan as Bic Camera Starts Accepting Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-bic-camera-starts-accepting-bitcoin/,"Japan’s consumer electronic retail giant Bic Camera officially began accepting Bitcoin payments on Friday at two of its stores in Tokyo. 28 media crews reportedly gathered to cover the premier event. Bitflyer which processes Bitcoin payments for the stores has also launched a campaign to give away bitcoin to shoppers using its wallet. Also read: Bitcoin to Be Accepted at 260,000 Stores in Japan by This Summer Bitcoin.com recently reported about the partnership between Bitflyer and Bic Camera for two of Bic Camera’s stores in Tokyo to accept Bitcoin payments. Starting on Friday, customers can pay using bitcoin at the Bic Camera store in Yurakucho district, and at Bicqlo Bic Camera store in Shinjuku East. The latter is a hybrid outlet with a giant casual wear designer, manufacturer, and retailer, Uniqlo. Bic Camera executives say more stores could also start accepting bitcoin. “You can use Bitcoin at most 100,000 yen for one payment. Other payment methods can be used with Bitcoin together,” according to a Bic Camera’s promotional leaflet for Bitcoin payments. Customers can also collect reward points just as they would using cash. The event has been covered by major Japanese media outlets including Nikkei and Asahi Shimbun newspapers, as well as a large number of media publications worldwide. In addition, Japan’s national public broadcasting organization, NHK, has also aired a segment of the event. Bic Camera executives expect foreign travelers to be among the first to use bitcoin for payments but the number of local Japanese users are also expected “to rise eventually,” NHK reported. Ken Shishido, one of the organizers of the Bitcoin Tokyo meetup group, describes Bic Camera stores as a “Best Buy type of electronic shop.” At the premier on Friday, Bitflyer CEO Yuzo Kano spoke to the crowd and, according to a tweet by Shishido, he was “surrounded by 28 media crews at Bic Camera.” Starting on Friday, Bitflyer is also running a campaign to give away bitcoin to customers for shopping at the two Bic Camera stores using a Bitflyer wallet. From April 7 to 19, Bitflyer will give the first 200 customers who settle with Bitflyer wallet 500 yen worth of bitcoin, the company explains. Additionally, during the same period, Bitflyer is also simultaneously promoting its “Bitwire Shop” e-commerce service which allows customers to accept bitcoin on their own websites. Anyone with an e-commerce website or blog can accept Bitcoin payment just by inserting the Bitwire Shop URL onto it, according to a translation of Bitflyer’s description. For this campaign, the company will give the bitcoin equivalent of 500 yen to 200 people who register for Bitwire Shop ver2.1, and winners will be chosen by drawing. In both cases, the winners will receive their bitcoin within 5 business days after the campaign ends.  How many people do you think will be using bitcoin at Bic Camera?

2017-04-07T08:00:30-04:00,Bitcoin Drives Revolution and ‘Startup Government’ for Syrian Kurds,Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-revolution-startup-government-syrian-kurds/,"Amir Taaki, the developer of DarkMarket/OpenBazaar and Dark Wallet, seemed to disappear from the Internet in early 2015. Why? Speculation on the Bitcointalk forum ranged from suicide to fighting with or against ISIS. Also read: Would Bitcoin ‘Function’ in a Societal Collapse? “Rojava’s [Syrian Kurdistan] under embargo, so there’s no way to move money in or out. So we have to actually create our own Bitcoin economies. Now we have a technological tool for people to freely organise outside state system. Because it is a currency not controlled by central banks.” — Amir Taaki A recent interview (March 29, 2017) with the BBC revealed that the British-Iranian Taaki had journeyed to Syria to fight against ISIS. Or, rather, he fought for the Kurdish People’s Protection Units in Rojava in Northern Syria for a few months. Then, Taaki turned his hand to the blockchain. The BBC offered a tantalizing hint at how it is being used to create a society that is independent despite being surrounded by hostile states. (It is not clear how far along the societal e-plans are.) Upon returning to England in 2016, Taaki was detained by the police and, for the past 12 months, he has been free but on bail. And quiet. In 2014, Forbes listed Amir Taaki in its “top 30 under 30 entrepreneurs”. He has also been called the “enfant terrible” of Bitcoin because of his aggressive left-anarchism and privacy absolutism. In an October 7, 2014, interview with Bitcoin Magazine, Taaki explained: His confrontational attitude is exemplified by one product. Together with free-market anarchist Cody Wilson, Taaki developed the Dark Wallet which promised the ultimate in financial and personal privacy. Wilson described the project: “This is a way of using Bitcoin that mocks every attempt to sprinkle it with regulation. It’s a way to say to the government ‘You’ve set yourself up to regulate Bitcoin. Regulate this.’” Then Taaki disappeared. In June 2016, Jamie Redman commented: “Recently it has been suggested that Taaki is running with an Anarcho-socialist group called ‘Rojava The Plan’. The organization’s mission is to create a self-sufficient socialist coop with a 1-year goal to finish ’26 projects and advance Rojava’s decentralized economy’.” The projects include internet and phone systems, organic fertilizer production and 3D printers. The organization’s crowdfunding page declares: “We like Bitcoin!…. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the future of finance and decentralized economy. We are strong supporters of them, and accept them for this project. We hope to big future Bitcoin projects [sic] in Rojava. One of our goals is to heavily promote Bitcoin in Rojava.” The situation in Rojava was foreshadowed by Taaki’s concept of a Startup Government. This is a self-governing community that uses crypto-technology as its foundation. A July 14, 2014, article in Motherboard entitled “Dark Wallet’s Developer Envisions ‘Startup Governments’ Run on Bitcoin” stated: “He [Taaki] gave the example of the Cooperativa Integral Catalana (CIC), which he described as a ‘start-up government’ that wants to provide basic services to its citizens and manage resources in a more efficient, democratic way than the state.” The CIC website declares: “Bitcoin, cryptography, 3d printers, fabLab, free software, GNU-Linux, GPL, hacking, liquid democracy… More and more people are using technology to create models that subvert the financial, productive and social order in the world in which we live…” Taaki’s approach to building communities seems to be based on digital currencies, with smart contracts that replace most of the ‘valid’ functions of government, such as a civil court system. The Rojava experiment is very likely to fail. This is not merely because of powerful enemies such as ISIS and the Turkish government but also because its ideology is deeply flawed and tends to blur into authoritarianism. Rojava embraces “Democratic Confederalism”, a form of democratic socialism originated by Abdullah Öcalan, the leader of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK). It includes the goals of local autonomy, gender equality and sustainability. But the economic principles are themselves unsustainable as socialist nations have discovered through history. The politics may be unsustainable as well. Rojava contains approximately 4 million people and the problem of the dissenter is inevitable. The problem: short of violence, how do you make a dissenting individual “get with the program?” Foreign journalists with feet on the ground have pointedly commented on “a long string of violations committed against dissidents and journalists.” An Al Jazeera contributor wrote, “I witnessed the…worst crackdown on Syrian dissidents so far on June 28, 2013, in Amuda, after the party’s armed forces had killed six protesters the night before.” Other aspects are equally disturbing. For example, a strong streak of authoritarianism is evidenced by conscription. At what point does democratic socialism become statism by another name. Yet another objectionable aspect is captured by the 2016 headline, “Hacking Team hacker steals €10K in Bitcoin, sends it to Kurdish anticapitalists in Rojava.” Idealism financed by theft is difficult to parse. If Rojava does survive the current conflict, it probably will not survive its own ideology and will drift toward statism. If Rojava fails, critics may well view it as the failure of digital currency to construct a viable society, when it will actually have been the failure of socialism to do so. Bitcoin deserves better. Putting Rojava aside, Bitcoin needs Taaki. It needs Unsystem – a group of coders and designers who constitute an anarchist counter-movement in which he is key. They are the antithesis of the ‘Banks Love Bitcoin’ crowd who march toward state partnerships, licensing and regulation. Taaki cautioned: Taaki has been quiet of late. The recent articles in the BBC and Wired are encouraging, but the man is unlikely to speak out provocatively until the police investigation is closed.

2017-04-07T05:00:31-04:00,Australia’s Law to End Double Taxation of Bitcoin Stalled,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/australia-law-double-taxation-bitcoin/,"Last year, Australian Treasurer Scott Morrison promised to swiftly act on changing the goods and services tax (GST) law, in order to end the double taxation of bitcoin and other digital currencies. However, over fourteen months have passed without any legislative progress. Now, the issue is no longer a priority and bitcoin continues to bear GST twice in Australia. Also read: Australia’s Treasurer: Progress Made to End Bitcoin Double Tax The Australian Tax Office (ATO) currently does not consider bitcoin and other digital currencies money for GST purposes. Instead, bitcoin is considered “a form of `intangible property`” under the GST act and regulations. Consumers using bitcoin to pay for other goods and services are effectively “bearing GST twice”, the government describes. Bitcoin users are taxed when acquiring the digital currency, and again when using it to purchase goods and services. The government started working with the fintech industry in March 2016 to reform the GST law, with the aim to end the double GST treatment of bitcoin. One solution discussed was to define the digital currency as money under the GST act, which the government agreed to. Australia’s national fintech industry association, Fintech Australia, provides input into the development of the government’s innovation agenda. Through the association, the fintech community collaborated and drafted a document of recommended reforms. Early last year, the group identified the GST taxation change as a core reform priority. Treasurer Morrison said he would act on it quickly and promised a draft legislation. A discussion paper outlining the proposed change was published in May. Following this paper, the government received fourteen comment submissions, all in favor of amending the GST act to define bitcoin as money. Over fourteen months have gone by with no legislative progress. Fintech Australia CEO Danielle Szetho told Innovationaus.com publication this week that the fintech community is still eagerly awaiting the draft legislation which Morrison promised. However, so far, there has been no further movement made. “By all accounts the government is still committed to act on the issue, but it is far from a priority”, the publication wrote. Szetho also noted that changing the definition of Bitcoin is “one of the original priorities we put in the reform paper and one they said yes to. But here we are, 14 months on and still nothing.” Asserting how this act is “a very technical piece of work which no-one could argue with”, she claims “it could be put through Parliament very quickly”. Nonetheless, she describes: The longer the government takes to amend the GST law, the further Australia falls behind other countries. The European Union had decided back in October 2015 that digital currencies are not to be doubled taxed. The UK also has had a similar policy in place since March 2014. Japan has recently started considering bitcoin a method of payment as well as abolishing consumption tax on acquiring bitcoin.

2017-04-06T14:00:00-04:00,Pixelated Bitcoin Logo Gets Painted on the R/Place Canvas Experiment,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/pixelated-bitcoin-logo-painted-rplace-canvas-experiment/,"This week many Bitcoin enthusiasts saw the popular digital currency symbol on a giant-sized canvas of pixels on the subreddit r/place. Also read: Kim Dotcom Previews Bitcache, Introduces Megaupload 2’s Bitcontent The April Fools’ Day social experiment created by Reddit had over 200,000 subscribers who were allowed to place one pixel on an empty canvas that was 1000 X 1000 pixels in size. The competition on r/place started on March 31 and ended 72 hours later, with many people adding a pixel to make smaller pictures. The catch was that users can change any pixel on the board, but have to wait five minutes between changing pixels again. Reddit users formed teams and used script bots to place funky pixelated drawings of their favorite ’80s cartoon characters or subreddit logos. Bitcoin proponents also participated in the fun by creating their own teams and calling on other Bitcoiners to help keep the Bitcoin logo represented on the canvas. Other pictures that were displayed were Mona Lisa, the Linux penguin, sports team logos, national flags, He-man, and much more. In the beginning, the picture looked messy as everyone participating raced to get their logo on the canvas. As a bunch of Bitcoin fans joined the r/place competition, there were a few different symbols or the word “Bitcoin” displayed on the canvas. The Segregated Witness logo and the word “Unlimited” were also at one time displayed on the map of pixels. Throughout the weekend, across a few Bitcoin-related subreddits, many people saw various forms of the Bitcoin symbol created in pixels. Furthermore, many participating Bitcoin fans stated that they fought with people making the French flag and buttcoiners also messed with the image. The Bitcoin logo came out rather well, but the word “Bitcoin” actually said “bitcom” possibly due to some buttcoiners. There were many other subreddits with misspelled names as well such as r/tesla forum’s picture. With every subreddit participant fighting over their corner of the pixel-painting, r/place was quite the battle. Despite the pixel wars, the experiment was very popular among Redditors as one participant explains: The Bitcoin symbol itself did make the final cut among hundreds of other pixelated images as the competition came to an end on April 3. The tiny white and orange square is located on the bottom left side of the 1000 X 1000 pixel image. Some Bitcoiners on forums noted how well the cryptocurrency Monero did with their logo above the Bitcoin symbol and word. Bitcoin proponents who helped with the symbol were proud of their accomplishment, as many of them worked in teams and used paint bots to help with the process. Overall the social experiment was fun for all Redditors participating and thousands of users helped paint the canvas. This bodes well for bitcoin, as it’s possible a few of those thousand participants of r/place may have seen the logo, sparking interest in the subject of cryptocurrency. Moreover, the r/place canvas made it to the front page of Reddit, where tens of thousands saw the picture and may have seen the quirky pixelated bitcoin logo that says “bitcom.”  The final full-size version of the canvas at r/place can be viewed here, and a complete 72-hour time lapse video can be seen below.  What did you think of the final version of the pixelated canvas located at r/place? Did you think Bitcoin enthusiasts did a good job? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-04-05T19:00:57-04:00,FED Board President Does not Understand Bitcoin or the Nature of Trust,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/fed-president-not-understand-bitcoin-concept-trust/,"A recent editorial published by Bloomberg on April 4 had quotes from the Philadelphia Federal Reserve’s Patrick Harker concerning digital currencies. In the article, he demonstrates his ignorance about bitcoin’s volatility, the future of banks, and the concept of trust.  Also read: Bitfinex Makes Good on Debt, 100% of BFX Tokens Redeemed The article’s author quotes Harker, saying that digital currencies will not replace banks. Harker said, “Digital currency won’t topple traditional, government-sanctioned money from its central role in the economy in the foreseeable future.” Harker believes digital currencies will not delegitimize banking and the banking system as it stands. The article emphasized a dollar is a dollar, and people know the dollar will retain its value. Harker believes digital currencies cannot possess the same level of trust as a result of their volatility. “A fiat currency like that in the United States, which is issued by a central bank in a secure and stable economy, works because we trust it,” explained Harker. “A dollar is a dollar. We all agree that it is and there’s not much that can undermine that faith. We experience inflation, sure, but not often in dramatic or abrupt ways.” Harker’s argument that private, digital monies can never have trust because of their instability is misleading. What Harker does not want people to know is governments are not the only factors that provide a currency with stability. It is true central planners can stabilize money by writing coercive laws, but a currency can also stabilize as a result of higher demand on a market. The volatility experienced by bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies do not occur because people don’t “trust” them. The volatility occurs because of lack of adoption and usage. It means these currencies are still in what economists refer to as “price discovery phase.” In other words, the fact there is not much liquidity in the market causes the price to fluctuate violently. However, this aforesaid view represents a traditional economic perspective. There is another, deeper idea to consider: maybe money stability is a myth. According to Daniel Krawisz, cryptocurrencies can be trusted without needing stability. In a fascinating article on nakamotoinstitute.org, Krawisz makes the case that Bitcoin could perform as a legitimate money while being “volatile.” Krawisz says that nothing in the universe is inherently “stable.” He said: Krawisz makes a valid point. He provides the stimulating fact that politicians like Harker merely invite the gullible masses to accept that stability is necessary for a currency (or prices). It makes sense if one considers the perspective of a petty tyrant or control freak. Politicians are constantly trying to “stabilize” and control everything. However, the stability they create through law or “monetary policy” is artificial. In reality, markets constantly shift. The universe is in an ongoing state of flux and transformation. Indeed, we saw the artificial nature of government controls when the monetary bubble collapsed in 2007, which likely happened as a result of monetary controls and policies instituted by the Federal Reserve. In other words, government’s attempt to stabilize the market only backfired. Their idea that stability prevents problems was shown to be wrong. In the end, stability may be a myth because it implies a currency does not need to be stabilized. Stability may not even matter when it comes to a cryptocurrency like bitcoin. Volatility may just an inherent feature of money in a digitized, free market environment. If this is the case, Harker’s argument that digital money will not replace fiat currency because people do not trust it is doomed to failure. Cryptocurrencies—whether bitcoin or an altcoin—will inevitably grow to replace fiat currencies if people use them. Additionally, what we have learned is that “stability” is not necessarily indicative of trust. If people are forced to use a currency, then “trust” is artificial. Real trust is generated through growing use of a currency. It is also generated through the knowledge that central planners will not manipulate their money to the point of devaluing it. In this sense, Harker’s last words, “No matter what happens in the world of fintech, you still need a trusted broker of money,” ring false on all levels. He has no idea what “trust” means; and ironically, does not realize that many no longer trust the banking empire he supports. The reality is that trust is in the eye of the beholder, and not signaled only whenever a bureaucrat waves a magic wand.

Many of its stores are either located in front of a train station or are directly connected to one, making them very easily accessible with lots of foot traffic. Bitflyer is the largest bitcoin exchange by volume. According to Nikkei Asian Review, the two companies have partnered and Bic Camera will start a trial to accept bitcoin payments at two of its locations in Tokyo on Friday, using the Bitflyer’s payment system. The first location is Bic Camera’s flagship shop in Tokyo’s Yurakucho district, and the other is Bicqlo Bic Camera which is the hybrid outlet with Uniqlo located in Shinjuku. Usage trends at the two test stores will help the company decide whether other locations will accept bitcoin payments. The publication details: Meanwhile, another major Japanese bitcoin exchange, Coincheck, has partnered with Recruit Lifestyle, the retail support arm of human resources conglomerate Recruit Holdings. Coincheck confirmed the partnership to Bitcoin.com, adding that currently the company “holds 99% of bitcoin payment market share”. By this summer, bitcoin will become a payment option at shops that use Recruit Lifestyle’s proprietary point-of-sale (POS) app called Airregi. Currently, 260,000 food establishments and other retail locations nationwide use this tablet-based POS system. While Nikkei reports that about 4,500 stores in Japan currently accept bitcoin as payments, in an interview with Bitcoin.com in January, Coincheck revealed that more than 5,000 merchants and websites accept bitcoin through the company’s system. Electronic money is popular in Japan. In addition to cash payments, some of the most popular electronic payment methods are Suica and Rakuten’s Edy, which are rechargeable contactless smart cards. While Suica is accepted at about 380,000 outlets and used as a fare card on train lines in Japan, Edy can be used at 470,000 locations nationwide.

The “Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative” had some of the most popular and leading wallet representatives within the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Also read: Fifty Developers Hack With Bitcoin for Two Days in San Francisco Bitcoin wallets developers share a mutual interest when building the cryptocurrency wallets we all use today. Lots of companies use similar industry standards within the bitcoin wallet environment like deterministic wallet infrastructure, security features and more. This weekend a large group of bitcoin wallet developers met at the popular bitcoin-accepting bar in Berlin, Room 77. The Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative (S3ND) had wallet representatives from fifteen different platforms attend among other industry developers.  S3ND included representatives from popular bitcoin wallet companies such as Ledger, Trezor, Green Address, Bitgo, Armory, Electrum, Mycelium and many more. Furthermore, the meeting also included bitcoin proponents such as the Lighting Network developer Olaoluwa Osuntokun (Roasbeef) and core developers Luke-jr, Jonas Schnelli, and Matt Corallo attended as well. The S3ND initiative’s road map also plans to host more wallet standards round table meetings in the future to create better wallet interoperability. “Developing a common language and the best-practices for wallet design, without preventing competition and the freedom of wallet designers to innovate, is critical to users,” explains the  S3ND founding principles. “Bitcoin must be interoperable. Users must be able to choose the wallet software and hardware they want, with the freedom to migrate when they see fit.” The meeting at Room 77 discussed subjects such as wallet migration, Segwit, Bitcoin Proposal discussions (BIP), multi-sig standards and more. “As the organization matures, working groups will continue to develop standards independently, which will be discussed and ratified at annual meetings,” details S3ND organizers. Furthermore, attendees focused a lot of attention towards privacy standards such as private transaction relays, and common transaction formats. While a significant amount of wallet companies are members of the organization other digital currency programmers are welcome to attend. Other bitcoin wallet representatives who could not attend expressed their interest in the wallet standards roundtable. “We would have loved to attend this,” said the developers of Samourai Wallet. “Unfortunately we didn’t see any advanced notice of this event taking place. Looking forward to the outcome of this event. “I would love to attend (Breeze Tumblebit Wallet), but unfortunately it’s the other end of the world,” explained Adam Ficsor, a contributor to the Tumblebit research paper. One of the organizers of the event, Lightning developer Roasbeef, explained to wallet developers who could not attend that a summary of the event would be created in the near future. “We will likely prepare a summarization document to be published after the event which goes over the topics discussed, action items, and follow-up work. Keep on eye on this Github org,” Roasbeef detailed. Organizers seemed pleased with the first annual S3ND and the creation of a forum for wallet standards. Members believe the meeting will lead to better wallet design and “more efficient and applicable standards processes can be developed.” What do you think about the Bitcoin Wallet Standards Initiative (S3ND) roundtable meetings?

2017-04-03T06:00:28-04:00,Mexico’s New Bill Could Be a Game Changer for Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/mexico-bill-bitcoin-game-changer/,"Mexico has recently introduced a bill which defines Bitcoin as a digital asset and sets forth rules for bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin.com spoke with Sebastian Acosta Checa, founder of Mexican bitcoin exchange ISBIT, to learn more about this new bill and its effects on the Bitcoin ecosystem. Also read: How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost
 Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell us about this new bill and when it was introduced? Sebastian Acosta Checa (SC): The first draft of this financial technology law was presented by the Secretary of Credit and Public Finance of Mexico, Jose Antonio Meade, in the 80th Mexican Banking Association Convention, held in Acapulco on March 23. In accordance with this law, the central bank will define the regulation that applies to digital assets such as Bitcoin. This legislation is being promoted by the Executive Branch but it still needs to be approved by Congress. Nevertheless, I have noticed wide consensus across political parties about how this can benefit the economy, trigger more foreign investment and help our industry grow. This new regulation is part of the National Policy for Financial Inclusion presented by the President of Mexico on June 21, 2016. One of the axes of the policy focuses on the utilization of technological innovations to provide financial services. The government is recognizing how the technological advances have transformed the manner in which people in several industries operate, including the financial sector. It is an official priority of the state to foster the application of technological innovations to reduce the cost of financial services and widen its use among the population. BC: What does the bill say about Bitcoin? SC: The central bank will define what a ‘digital asset’ is by following basically two criteria. The first criteria is the widespread adoption by the public (high market cap) and the second is the protocols, rules, and mechanisms that allow generation, identification, division and control the replication of such units of account. Persons (including miners) with digital assets, who do not perform operations on behalf of others, are not required to obtain authorization from regulators and can use digital assets in their daily commerce. BC: Does the bill specify what market cap is required for a cryptocurrency to be considered a digital asset? Also, is there any indication of the specifics of the consensus mechanism required? SC: The draft is a 76-page document that covers a lot. It addresses most legal concerns and objections to work with Bitcoin and blockchain tech in Mexico, but it does not go into that level of detail or give concrete, technical requirements. Guidelines will be published in the form of “Circulares” (Technical Letters) by the central bank. These letters are where, for example, the central bank will define what are legitimate “digital assets”. I can guarantee you Bitcoin and Ethereum will be there. The government’s goals are to transit to a digital economy, reduce or eliminate the use of physical cash, make the taxation process more efficient and transparent, create a mechanism to automate regulation/auditing and supervision tasks, expand the coverage of high quality and affordable financial services and more. BC: What does the law say about bitcoin exchanges? SC: One section of the Financial Technology Law deals specifically with ‘Digital Assets Management Institutions’ which include bitcoin exchanges such as ISBIT. This section of the law explains that digital assets management institutions must be solvent and cannot operate under fractional reserves. Companies such as ISBIT are required to hold all the deposits of their clients, unlike banks that are capable of lending part of the deposits they obtain. It is forbidden for bitcoin exchanges to lend or invest customers’ assets. This is a great consumer protection measure. They must also inform the public about all of the risks their clients assume when handling digital assets. In the case of services such as ours which interface with traditional banking and payment networks, we also have to obtain the legal status of an “Electronic Payment Funds Institution”. BC: What are the requirements for exchanges to hold funds? Is it the same as what Hawaii requires which made Coinbase exit the state? SC: No, it would be completely unreasonable for the regulators to expect exchanges to hold the equivalent amount of value in fiat currency to match the digital asset deposits. That would kill our business model. The intention of the regulators is not to kill the industry but rather to establish rules that will give more consumer protection and foster a safe path to mass adoption. Exchanges must have in their vaults the amounts of digital assets that match their liabilities. For example, if users deposited 687 bitcoins, 35,820 ether, 10,000,005 pesos and 400,000 dollars, then we, as exchange operators, need to hold at least that amount in our reserves (687 bitcoins, 35,820 ether, 10,000,005 pesos and 400,000 dollars) and be able to prove it in case of an audit. Also, all customers’ assets must be clearly segregated from the exchange operators’ own capital and assets. BC: Other than being a bitcoin exchange, what other services does ISBIT offer? SC: Our platform allows the electronic exchange of fiat currency for digital assets in an open market directly between participants, ensuring zero counterparty risk. We offer 3 combined services that international trade corporations need. We provide real-time local payments, traceable and efficient cross-border payments, and low-cost FX services. Corporations in Mexico are paying significant amounts in FX and bank fees when they need to send payments to or receive payments from other regions in the world. We allow corporations to perform a cross-border transaction in a matter of minutes at significantly lower cost. We have connectivity and interoperability with more than 50 banks and financial institutions in Mexico. This gives us the capability of processing real-time payments (for example, deposits or withdrawals) between our platform and bank accounts, debit cards, or cell phones linked to a bank account. This gives us access to 39% percent of the Mexican population (essentially everyone above the age of 15 with a bank account). BC: When is this bill expected to pass? SC: The bill will be presented in the course of the next 2-4 weeks in the Congress of Union. I expect it to take several months for this law to pass. Nevertheless, it is very important for Bitcoin and blockchain tech companies to be prepared because, according to the draft, it will become effective from the first day it is published in the Official Journal of the Federation. Our company has already implemented all the corporate governance, solvency, AML, KYC and ATF controls and procedures considered by the law in order to be prepared to obtain our license the moment the law becomes effective. BC: How will this new regulation affect Bitcoin adoption in Mexico? SC: This regulation will give our industry a boost. Regulated bitcoin exchanges will be considered part of the financial system and will be able to integrate with many aspects of the economy. Given the size of the Mexican cross-border payments market (almost $775,000,000,000 USD in foreign trade payments, and more than $25,000,000,000 in remittances), what’s happening right now is much bigger than the possibility of an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) in the USA. The regulation over our activities might open the door to foreign trade multinational corporations, financial institutions such as money transmitters, hedge funds, insurance institutions and others to use our platform to exchange currency and perform cross-border payments more efficiently. Now consider the Pension Plans Administrators in Mexico (AFORES). This institution has assets under management in excess of 4,004,702,000,000 MXN (about $215,306,559,139 USD). Some pension plan administrators have started to expand their horizon of investments, given the bad performance they all had in the last few months. Some have discovered bitcoin’s great performance over the years, but could not justify taking positions in the market… until now. How do you think Mexico’s new bill will affect bitcoin?

Also read: After Changetip’s Failure – Minitip Retries the Bitcoin Tipping Thing on Reddit A group of hackers consisting of young developers and senior level engineers gathered at the Hackreactor to develop ideas utilizing the bitcoin protocol. Attendees worked with the client Bcoin an alternative bitcoin implementation written in (javascript) node.js. The Bcoin protocol was created by software developer Christopher Jeffrey, the Chief Technical Officer at Purse. Just recently the alternative bitcoin software made headlines because a Bcoin block was mined on bitcoin’s mainnet. This was the first block ever mined with an alternative implementation that was not written in C++. Because the Bcoin code is not written in Satoshi’s original C++ framework, programmers may find the node.js infrastructure an easier method to develop bitcoin applications. “Bcoin was created to reduce complexity, be more “hackable,” and allow for developers to quickly jump into bitcoin development with less barrier to mental entry,” explains Purse. “This made Bcoin the perfect technology to introduce to budding/senior developers over the course of a 2-day hackathon.” The event was sponsored and organized by members of Purse, Private Internet Access (PIA), Ledger, Chain and more. Attendees of the two-day hackathon also heard from Bcoin developer, Christopher Jeffrey (JJ), and the co-founder of Lightning, Olaoluwa Osuntokun (Roasbeef). Purse says “building on bitcoin has a steep learning curve,” but company explains the fifty attendees learned a lot and made valuable connections over the two days. For instance, developers had issues understanding the testnet/simnet and how to use test tokens with their pilot applications. Programmers also had difficulty with conceptualizing bitcoin input/output scripts, as Purse explains; First place prize winners took home one bitcoin, a years subscription to Private Internet Access VPN, a signed copy of The Internet of Money by Andreas Antonopoulos, and a Ledger Nano hardware wallet. Michael Folkson, Alex Bosworth, and Nathan Basanese won first prize for building a monetizing full node project which showed that full node operators could be incentivized in the future. The second-place contestant was a team called Bocksy Bay who made an application that stores torrent magnet links on the blockchain. Essentially the idea could create an immutable censorship resistant Pirate Bay explains the developers. A team dubbed Bstream created a platform that enables streaming music in real time by paying with a Bcoin wallet. Purse explains the idea was popular among attendees and the bitcoin marketplace startup was “impressed by their frontend interface.” Purse adds, “If you’re interested in learning more about some the projects, the winners and a few of the participants were kind enough to leave their awesome projects up on public repos. Fork them, play around with them. And, maybe try out the hackathon boilerplate yourself and see what you can build in a weekend?” What do you think about Bcoin and the recent Hackathon in San Francisco?

2017-04-01T04:00:11-04:00,Japan Declares Sale of Bitcoin Exempt from Consumption Tax,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-sale-bitcoin-exempt-consumption-tax/,"March has been a busy month for Bitcoin in Japan. The country officially recognizes Bitcoin as a method of payment today. While Japan prepares to recognize the digital currency, its long-awaited tax reform bills have also been passed this week. One area the bills address is the consumption tax treatment of digital currencies including bitcoin. Also read: How Japan Prepares to Recognize Bitcoin as Method of Payment on April 1 The consumption tax is the tax levied on spending on goods and services by the Consumption Tax Law, a municipal law in Japan. “This system can be considered as similar to the VAT (value-added tax), GST (goods and services tax) or sales tax”, describes Kyoto City Official Travel Guide website. Deloitte Japan explains that, before the tax bills were passed, digital currencies such as bitcoin “do not fall under the category of exempt sales, and as a result, the sale of virtual currencies in Japan have been treated as taxable for JCT [Japanese Consumption Tax] purposes”. In Japan, the consumption tax is currently a flat 8 percent on all items, but it is scheduled to increase to 10% in October 2019. On March 27, the Japanese National Diet passed the 2017 tax reforms bills which include amendments to the Fund Settlement Law, enacted last May. The proposed amendments were agreed on by Japan’s ruling coalition last December. The Fund Settlement Law “newly defined “virtual currency” as a means of settlement”, according to Deloitte Japan, which explains: The new rule defines digital currencies as “asset-like values” that “can be used in making payments and can be transferred digitally”, reports Japan Times. Therefore, bitcoin and other digital currencies are no longer liable for consumption tax of 8%. However, being asset-like, digital currency trading is still liable for capital gains tax. “Profits from trading bitcoin, when coming from continuous trading for the purpose of generating profit, can be considered as income from business activities or miscellaneous income”, explains Japan’s largest exchange by volume, Bitflyer. “However, in the case of the sale of bitcoin held for investment purposes it can be considered a capital gain”. Special thanks to: Anderson Mori & Tomotsune’s special counsel, Ken Kawai, for help in interpreting Japanese law. What do you think of Japan dropping consumption tax on bitcoin?

Also read:  Bitcoin in Numbers — a Visual Look at Bitcoin Growth and Demand So Far in 2017 After the past two weeks of ups and downs, the exchange rate of bitcoin has taken a breather the past few days, moving relatively stable and sideways. There’s been quite a bit of consolidation around the $1,020 mark as it looks like bulls may be prepping for an upcharge. Currently, major exchange order books show buyers have some control, and unless there is some negative news, an upward breakout is entirely possible this weekend. At the time of writing the price per BTC had reached an average of $1,070, around 12 pm US EST.  Last week technical indicators had shown the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) was trending higher than the 200 SMA, and this is still the case. This further supports the possibility of an upswing in the near future. The stochastic oscillator also presently shows an upward momentum which affirms the buyer’s market will likely continue. There is still heavy resistance in the $1,100 range, but the price is edging towards the $1,080-1,090 mark at the time of writing. Volatility has subsided over the past 72 hours, and there hasn’t been much playing room for intra-range traders and day-trading speculators, but that looks like that may change in the short-term. A lot has been going on in the world of digital assets as cryptocurrency markets, in general, are now capturing a total market capitalization of over $25 billion. Bitcoin commands 66 percent of the market share dominance at press time with a $16.9 billion market cap and close to $400 million in daily volume.  Ethereum, the second highest valued digital asset, has continued to hold above the $50 per ether price range with a market cap of $4.5 billion. Alongside this, the third highest valued token is now Ripple as Dash has been pushed out of the third position. Ripple has been experiencing an upswing over the course of the past two weeks. Dash, on the other hand, is suffering from a deep correction as one Dash now trades at $70, compared to its recent high above $110. Bears have been clawing at the value of Dash for the past three days as the price could not hold above the $80 range, leading to the downside break. The fifth highest valued cryptocurrency Litecoin (LTC) had a notable run on the morning of March 30. The price had run up 65 percent in a matter of hours reaching a high above $7 per LTC. Speculators believe the spike may be attributed to Litecoin’s upcoming Segregated Witness integration. Last week Litecoin was coasting along at $4 per LTC and the price today has dipped a touch, resting at just over $6. Other notable altcoins in the top ten such as Monero, Ethereum Classic, and Augur (REP) have all seen upward price bumps the past few days. Augur specifically is up over 26 percent at press time with an average price of $11.90 per REP. As bitcoin markets have remained fairly stable, day-traders and speculators are likely finding positions in altcoin market spikes. Bitcoin charts presently show we may be seeing the beginning of a bull charge this weekend, but currently, BTC traders seem uncertain. The Whaleclub Telegram channel which consists of over three thousand traders performed a small poll of which 70 people participated. The poll question which stated “What is your holistic outlook on the price of BTC by December 31, 2017,” detailed 67 percent of participants said “bullish” while 11 percent voted “bearish.” Bear Scenario: If the fiat value of bitcoin does not hold above the $1,000 range then bears could get a better grasp at bringing down the market price. Support looks decent in the $980 range if the trendline breaks, but deeper corrections could follow if the price doesn’t hold. At the moment a bear scenario seems unlikely, but you never can tell in the land of bitcoin. Bull Scenario: Currently bitcoin is slightly bullish and is breaking some higher price resistance. In the short-term, the price per BTC could break above the $1,080 mark and climb further from there if buyers continue to hop on the rise. An $1,100 price point could inject more optimism into the minds of traders which would attribute to more buy pressure. Currently, the upward trajectory is slow as order books still show big sell walls.             What do you think about Bitcoin’s markets at the moment? Do you think bitcoin can break above $1,100 again?  Or is the price going below the $1,000 range once again? What are your thoughts on altcoin markets?

They do this to spin a yarn that it is “illegal.” Also Read: Bitcoin Helps People Circumvent Economic Sanctions in Iran This occurs because politicians use fear mongering to deter folks from certain behaviors, and these tactics weigh heavy on the hearts and minds of the peasant classes. People take any kind of political “warning” as an absolute dictum or law. In reality, sociopaths called “world leaders” are merely passing judgement on people who choose to live freely of their own volition; they are condemning people who choose to buy stuff with their own money. This exact thing happened on March 28 in India. The India Economic Times reported the minister of finance Arjun Ram Meghwal replied to the Indian Parliament, Rajya Sabha, that using Bitcoin “could” lead to consequences for anyone who dares to disobey. He said: The key word above is “could.” This does not mean that Bitcoin is “illegal” in India. Politicians are having trouble passing specific laws to quell the use of Bitcoin. The politicians are afraid of cryptocurrency. Their laws and regulations always fall light years behind the development and evolution of technology. This causes the elites to squirm and squeal like apple-gagged pigs. This fear mongering of Bitcoin comes alongside drug raids in India. Recently, there was a “drug ring” busted for possessing and selling LSD. For anyone unfamiliar, LSD or Lysergic acid diethylamide, is a psychedelic drug that produces visionary states of mind that allow people to heal, introspect, and experience love for life. It is not an evil drug that kills people. The only thing evil is the cops and politicians who cage the innocent for possessing the compound. The Times of India reported on March 30, “The anti-narcotics cell of the city police arrested five people, including two students of two reputed colleges in the western suburbs, for drug trafficking and recovered psychedelic drug LSD worth Rs 70 lakh (about 7 million dollars) on Wednesday.” The kicker is that the five people “drug ring” allegedly used bitcoin to make their sells. The media leveraged fake news to make Bitcoin sound evil as a result of the drug bust. They suggested bitcoin has been regularly used as a dastardly medium of exchange in drug transactions. The media tied it in with the recent fear mongering about Bitcoin by the prime minister of India. The Times of India said, “The payments for the same were made through Bitcoins, a form of virtual currency. The government on Tuesday said Bitcoin is not authorised by RBI and any transction in it could result in breach of anti-money laundering provisions.” All of this political fear is indicative that the political class is having a fearful reaction against cryptocurrency, especially Bitcoin. They are afraid their anti-humanitarian activities will be thwarted by people who want to live outside the scope of their rule. This has caused them to criticize and castigate bitcoin, while also sensationalizing the arrest of drug dealers who used bitcoin in their transactions. In reality, it is false that bitcoin is illegal in India. Someone could accidentally stumble into the minefield of anti-money laundering laws and drug possession statutes, but just using Bitcoin or trading is not considered “illegal.” It’s just that it “could” be illegal, in the Prime Minister’s own words. This Indian battle of whether Bitcoin should be legal or illegal, accepted and used, is really just a political dig to prevent the spread and adoption of cryptocurrencies. The Indian government is playing the age old game of thrones; they are manipulating the population to see Bitcoin as evil. They want people to run away from exploring this money rather than embrace it. In this way, Bitcoin is a new kind of enemy. H.L. Mencken said it best, In this case, Bitcoin is the hobgoblin, but the fear is indeed imaginary. How can the Indian people overcome government fear mongering?  Images via Shutterstock and Wallpaperbackgrounds.com page. Do you agree with us that Bitcoin is the best invention since sliced bread?

The game called “Bitcoin VR” is a simulation of real-time Bitcoin transactions in a dark setting called the “Forest of Satoshi”, where players can even prune the network with a bow and arrow. Also read: Rare Pepe Gets Blockchained, Made Into Tradable Counterparty Tokens This week, the blockchain company Indiesquare is introducing its Bitcoin VR game via the Steam gaming network. Indiesquare is well known for its Counterparty token wallet, and its collaborative efforts with cryptocurrency incentivized games like Spells of Genesis, Sarutobi, and Takara. However, Bitcoin VR is a different kind of game that allows players the ability to virtually walk around the Bitcoin blockchain. Bitcoin VR has vector-like graphics where users can walk around, seeing visuals of transactions being processed in real-time on the blockchain. The single player Indiesquare game requires a virtual reality headset to play the simulator. Bitcoin VR developers recommend the HTC Vive headset.  The transactions shown in the game reveal the associated block height number and also the current price of bitcoin. Transactions are represented by block-like objects within the game and gems with larger transaction sizes create bigger gems. “Ok this is pretty geeky and may not be for all, but we think it’s cool, the first VR Bitcoin block explorer,” explains the Bitcoin VR description on Steam. “Ever wanted to see real time Bitcoin transaction in VR? Ever wanted to prune the blockchain with a bow and arrow? Enter the Forest of Satoshi —  In Bitcoin VR you can see real-time Bitcoin transactions fall from the sky in the form of gems you can grab a gem to see the transaction details or shoot them with a Bow and Arrow.” Alongside walking around the Forest of Satoshi watching live Bitcoin transactions, users can also see Counterparty token transactions. This includes tokens like Pepe Cash from the Rare Pepe blockchain trading game introduced a few months ago. Bitcoin VR also incorporates a mini-game that involves pruning the chain with archery.  Bitcoin VR runs on Windows 10 operating systems, and the creators recommend around 8gb of memory for quality play time. The game’s transaction simulation environment is considered by developers to be the first virtual reality-based blockchain explorer. Indiesquare games and the associated Counterparty tokens have become quite popular within the cryptocurrency community. Games like Spells of Genesis have done notably well last year, but a blockchain virtual simulator may be a different story. What do you think about the Bitcoin VR simulator coming to Steam?

2017-03-30T12:00:05-04:00,Freedom Cells can Leverage Bitcoin to Embrace Agorism,Sterlin Lujan,https://news.bitcoin.com/freedom-cells-can-leverage-bitcoin-to-embrace-agorism/,"Bitcoin’s decentralized nature is one of its most important features; it is the feature of freedom. This means bitcoin is not arbitrarily controlled by a central group of jackbooted thugs, political leeches, or other enemies of liberty. Also read: Where Do You Stand on the Yin & Yang of Different Bitcoin Ideologies? It is true Bitcoin relies on a set of developers to make decisions in terms of protocol changes (albeit dependent on approval by miners and node operators), but in no way do they possess the same authority as the sociopaths who manipulate the central banks in the United States do. Consensus among the developers and community determine the growth, evolution, and direction of the protocol. In this manner, Bitcoin pairs perfectly with a new type of decentralized, freedom-based community. These communities are what anarchist and freethinker Derrick Broze refers to as Freedom Cells. In Broze’s upcoming book Manifesto of the Free Humans, to be released on April 7, written with co-author John Vibes, they describe what they mean by “freedom cell.” These are small groups of renegades that consist of roughly eight members that unite in a decentralized fashion. Their goal is to work cooperatively to live outside the confines of the State. Broze has even started his own freedom cell in Houston, Texas, and refers to their living quarters as the Freethinker House. In their book, Broze and Vibes describe Freedom Cells as, These Freedom Cells implement agorism to power their activity. Agorism is a term coined by late philosopher Samuel Konkin III. It is the philosophy that people should make voluntary exchanges on the black market and subsist through these markets for the purposes of creating social change. Konkin referred to this type of activity as counter-economics. Broze and Vibes have taken this counter-economic philosophy and uniquely created a practical way to implement it via decentralized freedom cells, and thus Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies provide the obvious type of currencies these groups can use. The decentralized nature of Bitcoin allows freedom cells to prosper in an underground marketplace. It is true that many freedom cells may use a barter system as the primary portal of economic activity, but cryptocurrency provides alternative, digital, pseudonymous, and transferable store of value. Matter of fact, Bitcoin has the capacity to help incentivize people to create decentralized, peer-2-peer freedom cells, because it makes living economically within those groups more practical and exciting. An interesting side-effect of decentralization is it places emphasis on the smaller community or subgroup. When people realize they do not need central planners to run their lives, they immediately start thinking on a small scale. When there is no more government to defer to, people do not imagine that faraway authorities should control them or tell them how to live. Bitcoin is a part of this decentralizing process, and other cryptocurrencies may also fill a similar role. Bitcoin allows freedom cells to flourish, because it helps these groups make trades without necessarily using a barter system. It provides them with a technological means for accomplishing the same thing, except with more practicality. In essence, crypto-money was created as a technology to make economic transactions simpler and freer. This currency was intended to be the dominant currency of the counter-economy, and it will let more maverick liberty groups illuminate more paths to freedom and prosperity.

2017-03-30T03:00:55-04:00,How Japan Prepares to Recognize Bitcoin as Method of Payment on April 1,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-bitcoin-method-payment-april-1/,"In February, Bitcoin.com reported that the first Japanese bill containing digital currencies, recognizing Bitcoin as a method of payment, was expected to enter into force sometime in April. Last week, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) officially announced that the exact date for this bill to become law is April 1. Also read: Countdown: Bitcoin Will Be a Legal Method of Payment in Japan in Two Months The bill recognizes Bitcoin as a method of payment but not currency. It has “asset-like values”, explains the largest bitcoin exchange by volume, Bitflyer. They are “usable as payment to indefinite parties for the cost of purchase or rent of items or receipt of services and which can be transferred by means of electronic data processing systems”, the exchange describes, adding that: Along with making Bitcoin an officially recognized method of payment, the bill also imposes a number of requirements on bitcoin exchanges. They will be required to register with the Prime Minister and must meet a number of requirements. For example, they must have a minimum capital of 10 million yen as well as a sufficient IT system for theft and loss prevention. They must also establish several systems and processes, such as employee training, internal rules, governance, and guidance for outsourcing. The bill that will go into effect on April 1 also revises ‘the Act on Preventing of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds’. Bitcoin.com recently reported on how this affects bitcoin exchanges as well as their customers. To comply with the rules set forth in the bill, exchanges are introducing stricter know your customer (KYC) procedures. Nikkei Asian Review reported on Wednesday that the bill “poses an accounting dilemma” for Japan’s early Bitcoin adopters. The current Japanese accounting standards do not address digital currencies so there is no guidance on how to report them properly for tax purposes. Therefore, many people and companies simply leave their digital currency holdings off their books. Those who report them often mark their bitcoin holdings as “inventory” on their balance sheets. Issuers usually report them as a “liability”. However, the lack of standards means, “there is a risk that companies that hold virtual currency could turn out to have distorted valuations or that huge losses surface suddenly”, said Chikako Suzuki, a partner at Pricewaterhousecoopers Aarata.

2017-03-29T19:00:58-04:00,Would Bitcoin ‘Function’ in a Societal Collapse?,Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-function-societal-collapse/,"The question is a large obstacle to the mass adoption of digital currencies and it should be addressed head-on. The audiences being targeted as adopters are also a problem. The question and a problem overlap. Also read: A Decentralized Money Needs A Distributed Web for Maximum Freedom Calls for mass adoption usually aim at the mainstream and often translate into some form of government approval. This approach alienates two significant categories of people who should be fellow travelers: “preppers” and “survivalists.” (For the differences between them, click here. Preppers and survivalists are rigidly individualistic and anti-government. The crypto-community needs them to counterbalance the trend toward licenses, regulation, and state control. There are two problems with outreach, however: some voices in the crypto-community are openly hostile or scornful to preppers and survivalists; many preppers and survivalists view bitcoin with skepticism. The later ask a reasonable question which is often shrugged off: will bitcoin survive a collapse of infrastructure which could include the electric grid? I have no doubt that digital currencies will not only survive but also grow as they have in the chaos that is Venezuela. But, again, the question is reasonable and deserves a respectful response. First, the indifference or hostility of some within the crypto-community. Preppers and survivalists were once viewed as bizarre dissidents but this is an antiquated attitude. Many of their lifestyle strategies, such as stockpiling canned goods and precious metals, are now mainstream and don’t occasion a sideways glance. Nevertheless, sophisticated bitcoiners may feel alienated from people who actively espouse a less technical lifestyle. This is not a barrier with outreach to these groups, however, as much as it is a barrier to connecting with the vast majority of average people. Not reaching out is one thing. Being openly hostile is quite another. Many within the digital community may not be blatantly antagonistic to preppers and survivalists. But, to the extent preppers and survivalists are addressed, it is often in a tone of contempt. For example, Jeff Berwick wrote about the subject at The Dollar Vigilante, Berwick’s psychoanalysis of SHTF people is baffling. Nevertheless, he raises two points that spin into the next barrier raised against preppers and survivalists from adopting digital currencies. • the scenarios of a possible collapse are “very real;”
• the scenarios may never occur. A common reason why preppers and survivalists reject digital currencies is because it requires the internet and electricity, both of which could easily become unreliable or unavailable. A sack of gold beneath the woodpile can be easily accessed and exchanged for the necessities of life. Digital currency…not so much. The scenarios of a collapse are “very real.” The economy is speeding toward a brick wall. Civil society has never been so contentious. And, then, there are global tensions. A key reason preppers and survivalists dismiss digital currencies is that they view them as overly dependent upon fragile infrastructure. To take preppers and survivalists seriously, consider just one unfolding situation: North Korea. The leader Kim Jong-un is an egotistical madman who may soon have the nuclear capacity to reach American soil. He may currently be able to attack American military bases in the region as well as Japan. A simplistic sketch of background. In March, Kim test-fired four missiles into seas off Japan. Recent U.S.-Japanese naval ‘exercises’ in the area were followed up by a stern warning from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson of a possible pre-emptive military strike, presumably to take out missile sites. North Korea counter-threatened with a nuclear strike if the Americans so much as fired one rifle and, then, it tested “a new…high-thrust rocket engine.” Another test occurred last Friday. Meanwhile, Tillerson’s talks with Chinese leaders – the only nation able to rein Kim in – appear to have gone poorly. And the installation of a powerful American anti-missile system in South Korea could not have helped. Upcoming talks between Trump and China may be more productive but only if someone budges on profound disputes such as who owns the South China Sea Islands. The preceding detail is offered as proof that worrying about your safety and your family’s is not hysterical. Not worrying may be the ridiculous position. But will a nuclear war happen? I don’t believe so. Nuclear war is highly unlikely if only because it would devastate every nation in the region, including the initiator. It is far, far more likely that the threats will continue and deepen the cold war that’s been spreading for decades: namely, computer attacks aimed especially at financial institutions and infrastructure. A severe economic collapse seems inevitable, however The question remains. Even without nuclear war, would bitcoin be able to function during a collapse or a cold war? Yes. Electricity and the internet may be less reliable or more expensive but they would be available. An increasing dependence on the blockchain would make it a top economic priority. It would also be a top military priority. In October 2016, the Pentagon revealed it was actively exploring blockchain technology “to create tamper-proof military computer systems, including those used to control America’s nuclear weapons.” Other nations are undoubtedly doing the same. The bad news: an economic collapse or a cold war would negatively affect the internet and the electrical grid. The good news:
• Aspects of the internet were specifically designed to survive war by being decentralized.
• The blockchain will be essential to both societal and global functioning which means the internet will be given top priority.
• Local economies will be also be built on the blockchain. “Most of the technologies already exist. Distributed Identity (Blockstack, Bit ID, etc) combined with on chain issuance of assets (MSC, Counterparty, Colored Coins) combined with off chain transference and transactions of such assets (Hyperledger, Open Transactions, etc).” ‘Civil’ society and foreign policy will not be pretty in the next few decades. This is all the more reason to reach out to preppers and survivalists, who are generally “gold-bugs.” They should consider both precious metals and digital currency. Phil Champagne, author of the “Book of Satoshi,” offered an excellent reason. Flexibility has a huge survival value which requires options. He wrote, “While gold and silver are in their natural form in the physical world, they require the trust in a 3rd party when transferred in the electronic world. With Bitcoin, it is just the opposite, it is in its natural form in the electronic world but requires the trust in a third party if it was exchanged in the physical world (think of a paper note representing bitcoins held in custody, or a physical coin with a private key embedded in it – where you have to trust the manufacturer). So to me, they are absolutely complementary and both should be considered. It is funny that I have sometimes a hard time to convince people in the Bitcoin community to make them consider buying gold and silver.” As long as Champagne means “funny” as a synonym for “odd”…then agreed. Odd ducks should flock together. What do you think about functioning in a Societal Collapse?

2017-03-29T06:00:50-04:00,After Changetip’s Failure â Minitip Retries the Bitcoin Tipping Thing on Reddit,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-tipping-reddit-minitip/,"An early stage, Reddit-only application has recently launched within the social media giant, allowing users to tip each other small amounts of bitcoin. This free and simple system uses no other website or account and was created to replace the now-retired Changetip service. Also read:Â Zeronet Wants to Replace the Dark Web by Marrying Bitcoin to Bittorrent Over TorÂ  On Friday evening, a Reddit user named âMinitipâ (u/Minitip) announced a new âfree bitcoin tipping service whose only interface is Redditâ. The system was developed by Reddit user Cobos (/u/Cobosbfb)Â whoÂ said: Using Minitip, Reddit users can tip each otherÂ in bitcoin by replying to their posts or comments. Everything is done using Redditâs interface and there is no third party website to visit or account to create, Cobos explained. The lack of an off-site account keeps Minitip quick and private to use. The service is ready for testing now but Cobos recommendsÂ using itÂ with caution, citing that the service is in its infancy. âPlease use with caution, at entirely your own risk, and make sure you only deposit small amounts if you choose to use itâ, he wrote. He encouraged users to contact him if they found any bugs or have suggestions for improvement. Commenting on his system, he noted: Basic Commands
While there is no account to set up, at the time of writing, there are sixÂ commandsÂ with which users can manage their Minitip usage. All of them work by sending a Reddit private message to ‘u/Minitip’ with one of the commands in the message body. The subject of the message can be anything but it cannot be left blank. A few seconds after the message is sent, the senderÂ will receive a message back from Minitip with information based on the command used. Bitcoin.com tested the system out and it worked fine for us. Below are the six commands. Tipping
When using the âBalanceâ command, Minitip will return a message stating the user’s account balance in bits and dollar equivalent. It will also give the user a unique Bitcoin address controlled by Minitip to be used for top-ups. Once some bits are deposited into the Bitcoin address, theÂ Reddit user can tip another user by replying to a post or comment and typing “/u/Minitip [number of bits to tip]”, explains the Minitip instructions. For example, typing “/u/Minitip 1000 bits” in reply to a user’s comment will send that user a bitcoin tip of 1000 bits. Minitip currently charges “a flat miner’s fee of 100 bits (~$0.10)” for each tip sent, which is deducted from the tipper’s balance. “Though in the current Bitcoin climate this is a bit low, we feel that this strikes a good balance for small tips here and there that are by no means time-sensitive”, Cobos described. Receiving Tips
Tips received are directly deposited into a personal Bitcoin address which the user specified by using the [address] command. If no address is specified, the tips received will reside in the system until it is used to tip others or a withdrawal address has been assigned. Once the recipient specifies a personal Bitcoin address, âall future tips will go directly to the address you specifiedâ, Cobos explained. On top of the danger of losing a fewÂ bits from this being a new and untested system, another potential problem is that the identity of the developer, Cobos, is unknown. Reddit user Francispouliot wrote, âwhat are guarantees that you simply won’t run-off with the funds? It’s not like you’re an exchange and you created your Reddit account 6 hours agoâ. âYou’re right and making it as trustless as possible is the best way, just like with Bitcoin itselfâ, Cobos responded, adding that âI’ve been trying to think of ways to make it 100% peer-to-peer so that no funds are stored on our end at all. Might implement something like multisig in future, as long as it’s still convenientâ. Would you use Minitip? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-03-28T23:36:40-04:00,Solidx’s Attempt to Disqualify SEC’s Bitcoin ETF Decision Fails,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/solidxs-attempt-to-disqualify-secs-bitcoin-etf-decision-fails/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has announced its decision to disapprove the proposed rule change filed by NYSE Arca to list and trade shares of Solidx Bitcoin Trust. This move came after Solidx Management LLC, the sponsor of Solidx Bitcoin Trust, submitted a comment letter to the Commission, attempting to differentiate the NYSE Arca’s situation from that of Bats BZX Exchange. Also read: Examining SEC’s Decision to Reject Bitcoin ETF On March 10, the SEC made the decision to reject the listing of Coin on Bats BZX Exchange. The Commission primarily cited the main reasons as the lack of “surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading” of bitcoin and its finding that “the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated”. In an attempt to preemptively dissuade the SEC from using the same reasons to reject Solidx Bitcoin Trust, on March 15, its sponsor sent a comment letter to the Commission. Solidx Management LLC got straight to the point and claimed that the SEC’s decision to reject Bats BZX Exchange’s proposed rule change for Coin “should not apply to the proposed rule change by the NYSE Arca”. The reason which Solidx Management gave is that “the NYSE Arca proposed rule is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and will promote investor protection and the public interest and is therefore consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act”. The company acknowledged that the Commission abundantly cited how “surveillance sharing agreements provide an important deterrent to manipulation” throughout the Bats BZX Order. While arguing that “the investor harm from potential manipulation is hypothetical in nature and unlikely”, Solidx Management asserted that “the harm to investors from a lack of access to an insured vehicle is overt and likely to continue in the absence of approval of the NYSE Arca proposed rule change”. Moreover, the company wrote that an approval “would be in direct contravention of Section 6(b)(5)’s goal and purpose to protect investors and the public interest”, adding that: In addition, it pointed out a precedence when the SEC approved a rule change for the ‘Euro Currency Trust’ in November 2005 where the underlying market was not surveilled. However, the Commission said that the circumstances surrounding the Euro Currency Trust were very different from those of Solidx Bitcoin Trust. Throughout the Bats’ rejection order, the SEC asserted that bitcoin markets can be manipulated. While citing the Lewis Paper which it commissioned, Solidx Management claimed that “the bitcoin market as currently structured is resilient to manipulation”. In addition, it said that NYSE Arca’s proposed rule change “is designed to strengthen the bitcoin market’s resistance to manipulation even further”. The company also noted that: As icing on the cake, Solidx Management told the SEC that “the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) concern the shares of the Trust and not bitcoin”. It then explained that “when shares of the Trust begin to trade on the NYSE Arca, the rules of the Exchange, as such rules will be applied to shares of the Trust, will indeed prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and protect investors and the public interest”. The company then proceeded to claim that “none of the comments, however, focus on investor protection and the public interest, and none, nor do they relate to the SolidX Bitcoin Trust”. As of March 24, the SEC has received 11 comment letters for this proposed rule change. The company told the Commission that: Nonetheless, the SEC did not wait until the deadline, on March 30, to reveal its decision to reject NYSE Arca’s proposed rule change for Solidx. Its announcement on the morning of March 28 cites the same reasons given for rejecting Coin. The SEC wrote that: “The Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because it does not find the proposal to be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest”.

As the middle eastern country’s economic situation shifts, the region is steadily becoming fertile ground for bitcoin adoption. Also read: You Might Be Exchanging Bitcoin With Trading Bots and Not Even Know It Over the past few years, people have stated they believe Iran is the perfect candidate for embracing bitcoin’s censorship resistant utility. The logic behind this is largely due to the U.S. sanctions against Iran, which strictly enforces economic embargos and trading bans against the country. Many other countries also follow the sanctions as the U.S. and the United Nations Security Council has put a lot of pressure on allies to support the trade guidelines. Because of the strict economic sanctions the subject of bitcoin and Iran made headlines in 2012 from a report published by Bloomberg. The article explained that “dollar-less Iranians had discovered the virtual currency.” Bitcoin’s were becoming quite valuable in Iran because they could be easily spent abroad by citizens the report detailed. Iranian-American bitcoin consultant Farzad Hashemi said residents were amazed at how easily it could help them spend money overseas.         “They are instantly fascinated by it,” Hashemi explained. “It’s a flash for them when they realize how it can solve their problems.” Bitcoin’s legality in Iran is unclear as the country’s authorities have not officially established a political stance on the decentralized currency subject. Citizens currently rely on Localbitcoins for their bitcoins and also utilize a marketplace called Coinava. The peer-to-peer marketplace has been offering Iranians a platform to buy and sell bitcoins since 2013. Coinava is similar to Craigslist as users can meet to trade bitcoins in their local area. The Iranian bitcoin platform uses an escrow to hold traded funds and charges both parties 1% for the transaction.   Also, Bitcoin Iran’s public Facebook group has over 31,000 members, and there are very active Iranian bitcoin meetups as well in the country. Moreover, a shoe company in Iran called Persian Leather Shoes is a bitcoin only business. The Persian shoe company explains why it only uses bitcoin for shoe sales on its website stating;   Last week, according to a local Iranian news outlet, a Swedish firm called Brave New World Investments plans to use cryptocurrencies as a way to bypass trading sanctions in Iran. The startup aims to fund its operations with bitcoin as an investment vehicle for Iranian equities on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE).  The Linköping, Sweden-based Brave New World Investments (BNW) says it started its business because Swedish banks “fear” doing business with Iranian financial institutions. The firm’s founder Mikael Johansson details the startup will operate entirely with cryptocurrency with their partners and European shareholders. “Now we simply do not have a Swedish bank account. However, we soon will have an Iranian bank account for the equity investments. We pay our bills, shareholder dividends, Iran deposits – everything – in cryptocurrencies,” explains Johansson. “There are no sanctions in Sweden or in the European Union obstructing Swedish-Iranian investments, so we are not breaking any laws in our jurisdiction.” Bitcoin.com spoke with Johansson and asked him if he thinks problems may arise concerning the U.S. sanctions. “I think every operation where you do not know your bitcoin counterparty well, you might run into problems with sanctions,” Johansson told Bitcoin.com. “We will perform an audit on our process to ensure that no sanctions are accidentally broken.” The benefits of bitcoin’s censorship resistance is working well for citizens of Iran and those wanting to do business in the middle eastern country. With the central bank removing the U.S. dollar away from the region residents may find the attributes of bitcoin more tempting. What do you think about bitcoin adoption in Iran?

2017-03-28T13:11:59-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin’s Price Back in the 4-Digit Territory,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoins-price-4-digit-territory/,"Last week the price of bitcoin was trending downwards as bears controlled the market, pulling the price down to a low of US$920 per BTC on March 25. Currently, bitcoin’s value is once again ascending upwards over the past 24-hours reaching a high of $1068. Also read:  Bitcoin in Numbers — a Visual Look at Bitcoin Growth and Demand So Far in 2017 Bitcoin markets have been interesting to watch this week as technical indicators had shown much of the week was a seller’s market. The volatile price of bitcoin during the seven days dropped to a significant low breaking the psychological four digit price point. However, the downturn didn’t last long as another upward trend took bitcoin back above the $1,000 range on March 27. At the moment bulls seem to have found new entry points as buyers appear to be breaking resistance towards the $1,100 mark.  Technical indicators show the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is trending higher than the 200 SMA, possibly indicating a continued price rise in the short term. Order books on popular exchanges like Bitstamp and Bitfinex show there is substantial resistance in the $1,100 range and it may take some time to break past that price point. Stochastic and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) also indicate that buyers may be back in the game for now, but in the long-term trends could change rather quickly. Bears can easily steal the spotlight once again and claw the price down back into the $900s as markets are still shaky and traders seem uncertain. For now, buyers have left the sidelines and have managed to push the price action upwards for the past 12-hours. News from China’s central bank made headlines this week as authorities are reviewing new anti-money laundering (AML) guidelines for Chinese bitcoin trading platforms. Exchanges from the region are considering a 4-page proposal with strict AML procedures like “remote video verification” and “on-site identity verification” as well. A vast majority of Chinese bitcoin exchanges have still not lifted BTC withdrawal suspensions as parties from both sides work out the regulatory details. Furthermore this week the Japanese authorities have revised some amendments to the ‘Payment Services Act’ which will require exchanges to enforce firmer Know Your Customer (KYC) regulation procedures. Exchanges such as Coincheck and Zaif have already informed customers via their websites that they will comply with the new KYC rules. This means Japanese bitcoin trading platforms will enforce identity verification frameworks in order to prevent the transfer of criminal proceeds. This week many bitcoiners were either focused on the ongoing scaling debate or have been following the recent regulatory actions nation states are taking towards bitcoin. On a positive note, the “Big Four” multinational financial services firm Deloitte announced its in-house restaurant in Canada will now accept bitcoin for services. Iliana Oris Valiente, co-founder at Rubix by Deloitte told Bitcoin.com that “hundreds of Deloitte practitioners purchase their meals from Bistro 1858 every day,” and “many Deloitte professionals have shown excitement for the opportunity to start using bitcoin to buy their lunch and breakfast” from the restaurant. Combined cryptocurrency market capitalizations have pushed higher this week to over $24 billion. Additionally, bitcoin’s market dominance commands close to 70 percent of the entire market share as the percentage reverses last week’s downturn. The second highest market cap token, Ethereum, is still hovering above $50 per ether as its market has been stable for the past 48-hours. The price of Dash has seen a significant correction as the price hit a low of $83 per token this week. Ripple has stabilized just below a penny while other markets within the top ten are seeing small dips. Meanwhile, Litecoin has seen a price increase over the past two weeks and has risen above the $4 range. The price per bitcoin is slowly trying to obtain the $1,100 range, but there will be some struggles along the way. Technical indicators are showing an upside, but the market still seems uncertain after the past two bear traps dragging the price below the 4-digit mark. Overall bitcoin’s price is up over 2.5 percent since the last dip, as market buys have picked up the pace. Bear scenario: If bitcoin breaks under $1,000 once again short term support looks healthy in the $950-60 range. The past two downward slides this month reveal the market is trying to find a stable position after the March 10 ETF rejection. Traders will find that markets may continue to be slightly volatile over the course of the week if more key trend lines are broken. Bull scenario: As of now the market is on the upside but nothing like the bull market that took place three weeks ago. The price per BTC could ascend past the $1,100 mark in the short term, but there is massive resistance above this range. If buyers continue to hold the market, then bitcoin’s price could slowly regain the bull market it was riding weeks prior. What do you think about Bitcoin’s price trends at the moment?

2017-03-28T10:00:20-04:00,Japanese Bitcoin Exchanges Implement Stricter KYC Requirements,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/japanese-exchanges-kyc-requirements/,"As part of Japan’s amended ‘Payment Services Act’ which will enter into force on April 1, the ‘Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds’ has also been revised. This act requires Japanese bitcoin exchanges to implement a stricter Know Your Customer (KYC) process. Also read: How Japan’s New Regulations Affect Bitcoin Exchanges The amended Payment Services Act has long been discussed in Japan, but the date which it would enter into force was not previously set. However, last Friday, the Japanese Financial Services Agency (FSA) finally announced that the date for which this act will become law is April 1. This amended act also revises the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds which requires bitcoin exchanges to implement stricter KYC policies than how they have been doing. They must start checking the identities of customers who open accounts, keep transaction records, and notify authorities when a suspicious transaction is recognized. Major bitcoin exchanges in the country are now responding to this law. Both Coincheck and Zaif exchanges posted on their websites a new set of rules regarding KYC on Friday. Coincheck states that: According to Coinhills, Coincheck is the third-largest bitcoin exchange in Japan with a 24-hour trading volume of about 22,300 BTC at press time, whereas Zaif is the fourth largest with around 14,400 BTC trading volume in the same time period. The exchange with the most trading volume globally is Bitflyer, with over 98,000 BTC traded within 24 hours. Its trading volume is over four times that of the second-largest exchange, the Singapore-based Quoine. The Japanese yen has gained the rank of the world’s most traded currency for bitcoin, occupying 44.5 percent of the global bitcoin trading volume. This is largely a result from China’s fall from supremacy in the area and Japanese exchanges actively pushing their now-common zero-fee trading practice. On its website, Zaif details its new KYC procedure and encourages its customers to open an account before the new law go into effect on April 1, citing that account opening will be more difficult after that time. The exchange explains that after April 1, three sets of user identification will be required to open an account at the exchange. It explains that (translated from Japanese): For postal mail verification, the exchange will send a postcard to each customer’s registered address by “simple registered mail” as required by the law, Zaif explains. Customers will then need to enter their identification code as described in the postcard. Zaif reiterates that it cannot open an account for a customer unless all three requirements are satisfied, adding that customers who have not confirmed one of the three requirements “may not be able to use Zaif in part”. Coincheck has a similar process, as outlined in the steps below which are posted on its website. Meanwhile, Bitflyer claims to have already been carrying out strict identity verification checks “to a level exceeding that of ordinary financial institutions”, according to its website. For daily transactions of more than ¥50,000, the company verifies customers’ bank account information, as well as requiring customers “to submit an ID selfie (photo-affixed official identity verification documentation and selfie picture) as well as a passport/driving license copy”. However, the exchange still has to modify its KYC process to comply with the new rules. In an interview with Bitcoin.com last month, Bitflyer founder and CEO Yuzo Kano said: “we have already been audited and prepared the necessary internal organisation changes. We will need to change the KYC process to fit the new rule”. What do you think of Japanese exchanges’ new KYC procedures? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-03-28T05:00:47-04:00,Bitcoin in Numbers â a Visual Look at Bitcoin Growth and Demand So Far in 2017,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-numbers-visual-bitcoin-growth-demand-2017/,"The bitcoin economy is growing fast, and the environment is continuously evolving right before our eyes. 2017 is showing that more people are interested in bitcoin as demand for the decentralized cryptocurrency increases globally. Â  Also read:Â QE and Capital Controls Create Worldwide Demand for Bitcoin A lot has changed over the course of the past eight years within the bitcoin ecosystem, as trends are showing increased interest in the digital currency over time. This year there’s been a few bumps in the road, but bitcoin has held above the 4-digit price range for its longest period ever. 2017 is also showing that the entire bitcoin economy is shifting in more ways than one. Today we will take a visual look at bitcoin achievements and interesting cryptocurrency trends throughout this first quarter of 2017.  Localbitcoins has seen exponentialÂ growth in 2017 with all-time highs in trading volume this year. Weekly volumes have reached close to US$32 million per week on the peer-to-peer trading platform. Bitcoiner’s speculate some of the Localbitcoins volume spikes are due to recent events in China with the country’s central bank imposing harsh regulations on bitcoin exchanges. Furthermore many attribute the increase in peer-to-peer trading to the country’s enforcing strict capital controls and the many failing economies worldwide.  Since the recent events relating to regulation at Chinese bitcoin trading platformsÂ bitcoin trading volumes have dispersed more evenly on Localbitcoins. Before 2017 there was far less CNY trading on Localbitcoins than there is now. In fact, the top three currencies traded on Localbitcoins such as CNY, USD, and RUB are relatively equal, as Chinese residents have begun to use the peer-to-peer exchange more often. The latest regulatory crackdown in China shows that CNY bitcoin trading volumes have plummeted in 2017. Of course many have speculated that volumes in the past were exaggerated as Chinese exchanges offered trades without fees. Things have changed significantly in 2017 as China’s central bank has enforced new AML/KYC guidelines, ended margin lending tradingÂ and forced trading platforms to add fees to every trade on the exchange. Additionally, quite a few popular Chinese bitcoin exchanges have suspended cryptocurrency withdrawals, for over a month now, and many believe the suspensions won’t be liftedÂ until regulatory standards are firmly established. According to Google statistics, bitcoin searches are rising in 2017 in many countries around the world. Furthermore, chart one details that bitcoin users have doubled every month since 2013. Currently, chart two shows a vast amount of searches are mostly stemming from regions such as Africa and the Baltic region.  Bitcoin automated teller machines (ATM) located around the world have increased in numbers over the years and has reached an all-time high in 2017. According to Coinatmradar.com, there are approximately 1,081 bitcoin ATMs across 56 countries worldwide. Furthermore, there are now 23 bitcoin ATM manufacturers and 202 service providers located around the globe. The U.S. and Europe hold the lion’s share of bitcoin ATMs with larger concentrations. Many parts of the bitcoin ecosystemÂ have been growing upwards, such as increases in bitcoin wallets, transactions, trading volumes, price, and the Bitcoin network’s hash rate. The only thing that has decreased significantly within the bitcoin economy is the decentralized cryptocurrency’s price volatility. What do you think about the bitcoin economy’s growth and demand over the years and into 2017? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-03-27T14:00:57-04:00,Can Renewable Solar Power Decentralize Bitcoin Mining Operations?,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/renewable-solar-power-mining-operations/,"Over the past few years, some bitcoin enthusiasts have found ways to use renewable energy sources such as solar power to mitigate electrical costs associated with mining the decentralized cryptocurrency. Also Read: Five Geeked Out Fantasies You Can Fulfill Today With Bitcoin It’s a well-known fact that bitcoin mining consumes energy. Many people don’t realize the global cost to run the Bitcoin network, with electricity costs at millions of dollars every year. Some believe this has led to a concentration of miners in countries where electricity is significantly cheaper, like in China. It is said that mining has also resulted in larger facilities leading the race to mine bitcoins, while smaller home-based miners are typically pushed out of the competition. However, some individuals and pools have found ways to compete by offsetting the cost of electricity by utilizing renewable energy sources.  There have been a bunch of miners over the years who have harnessed energy from the sun to fuel their mining operations. Solar energy is a technique that uses radiant light to create electrical power, and has been used by humans powering devices since around 1880. Many people have mined bitcoin using the sun’s energy, as discussions of miners using solar power to mine can be found online dating back to 2012, and every year after. On July 1, 2012, a forum conversation on Bitcointalk.org revealed how some miners were mining bitcoins with solar power. “I have a 1.7kw off the grid solar power setup where I am, it’s a remote mining town in Lightning Ridge Australia,” explains a bitcoin miner in 2012. “You couldn’t run a GPU farm economically, but FPGAs work fine. I get 1.5GH/sec at 100w from the FPGAs and 350MH/sec at 100w from the GPU. I also have wireless internet, so I’m not connected to any form of power or land line internet. In 2013 a bitcoin enthusiast started an interesting conversation when he published a guide to building a solar powered mining-plant. Throughout the post, a few other individual bitcoiners revealed they were also utilizing solar power to mine. However, many of them affirmed some of the initial costs of buying or building solar panels for bitcoin mining can be costly and a person must wait to achieve a return on their investment. During the summer of 2015, a bitcoin miner from Europe revealed his solar powered bitcoin mining farm on Youtube. The miner said it cost him roughly £1000, but the panels were paid for with bitcoins he mined the year before. “As the majority of the equipment was paid for with mined bitcoin and by selling off obsolete mining equipment, the initial outlay wasn’t too painful,” details the solar mining farm owner. “The Antminer cost me about £100 used, not $500. The S3 is effectively obsolete but off-setting its power consumption by using the free solar electricity artificially increases its efficiency. Meaning, the system does make a profit, yes. As it generates more bitcoin than it uses in power. Just not a very big margin, only a few pounds a month. But I was never in this project to make money by mining.” Another small solar mining operation was built this year by the bitcoin club Nastymining. The organization is well-known within the crypto-community with its mining pool and physical coin mint. Nastymining partnered with the solar energy company Sunpower to power some of their Bitmain Antminers located in the facility. Also, the cryptocurrency exchange Yobit also donated a wind turbine to the mining project. “Yobit has generously agreed to sponsor Nastymining by donating enough BTC to purchase a wind turbine and bring our total green energy system to over 10kw. Since we will be generating electricity through wind and solar power,” explains the Operator of Nastymining. Solar energy could give individual miners and smaller mining organizations the ability to get back into the competitive mining industry. Solar power is just one type of the renewable energy resources bitcoin miners are utilizing today. Miners have learned to harness geothermal power in Iceland, and some miners are using hydropower for large mining warehouses in China. Not only do advocates believe renewable energy is cheaper but they also believe utilizing methods like solar and wind is better for the earth in the long run as well.  What do you think about miners using renewable energy sources like solar? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-03-27T08:58:30-04:00,Iphone Users Can Now Buy Bitcoins Directly Inside Breadwallet,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/iphone-users-buy-bitcoins-breadwallet/,"The bitcoin wallet Breadwallet has just launched the ability for users to buy bitcoins from inside their iOS app. This feature will be rolled out over the next two weeks, starting today. Bitcoin.com talked to founder and lead developer Aaron Voisine to find out more about this new on-ramp to Bitcoin. Also read: Popular Bitcoin App Breadwallet to Launch Built-In Exchange According to Breadwallet’s announcement: Initially, not all Breadwallet users can access this feature. “This will be a controlled rollout” available for only a small number of users, according to the company. “We’ll be enabling for 10% of users (randomly chosen) on launch day, and then ramping it up to all users over the next two weeks”, Voisine told Bitcoin.com. “At launch the service is available in the US, excluding NY”, he explained, reiterating that users can only exchange their US dollars for bitcoin currently. However, he noted that “we will continue adding more locations and local currencies going forward”. Following this iOS launch, he said: Last December, the company invited US and Canadian iOS users to beta test buying bitcoin with cash. The company described at the time that “options include both bitcoin ATMs and physical store locations where you can purchase bitcoin from a cashier”. It noted that all “the nearby options for purchasing bitcoin with cash” will be displayed on a map once the user choose the “Buy Bitcoin” option and then “Cash” within the app. “The payment processing will be handled by our exchange partners in each locality”, Voisine explained, adding that “our launch partner in the US market for bank transfers is Kraken”. He also noted that, after paying in fiat, “the funds are sent upon completion of the ACH transfer, which is typically 3 to 5 days”. He detailed: Kraken has been offering the ability for wallets to buy bitcoin in-app since it acquired non-custodial wallet funding service Glidera last December, renaming it Kraken Direct. The service offers “one-click buying and selling of bitcoin” from a wallet via ACH bank transfers and “never takes custody of their funds during the process”, Kraken’s website explains. The company claims to currently support “around 10 of the top wallets including Airbitz, Copay, Mycelium and Multibit, with many more in the development pipeline”. Following this iOS launch, “we’ll be quickly adding new locations and local currencies for bitcoin purchasing”, Voisine conveyed. “We’re also working hard to bring other new financial service offerings, as well as improved user experience around sending and receiving bitcoin (like BIP75) without compromising on the security, openness, or decentralization of the platform”.

2017-03-27T05:00:11-04:00,You Might Be Exchanging Bitcoin With Trading Bots and Not Even Know It,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/might-exchanging-bitcoin-trading-bots-not-even-know/,"Cryptocurrency trading isn’t easy, but there are many people who have honed the art of trading bitcoins and altcoins on a daily basis. Interestingly enough, most people don’t realize that many cryptocurrency traders use trading bots to execute trades faster and more efficiently, and sometimes even in their sleep. Also read: An Introduction to Bitcoin Trading and Technical Charts Lots of bitcoin traders use trading bots to perform quicker trades than humans can naturally process by themselves. Trading bots became popularized in the cryptocurrency environment years ago, with the infamous Mt. Gox “Willy & Markus” bots back in 2013. These alleged bots were accused of pushing the price of bitcoin up faster than a natural bull run. However, bots are not necessarily bad tools and they have been used in computational trading since the seventies. They are called bots because the programs execute trades like humans do, but they do it autonomously and can operate continuously without having to rest. Trading bots or algorithmic trading is a technique that uses pre-programmed software that analyzes market actions, such as time, price, orders, and volume. Bots or program trading is used within many global stock exchanges and is a legal practice for the most part. Bitcoin trading bots are said to establish more efficient trading and can be utilized on many well-known cryptocurrency exchanges today. There are bots that are free of charge and can be downloaded online. Some people have also designed their own bitcoin trading bot software. Then, there are trading bot services you have to pay for, offered by various trading engine and programming companies. Haasbot The Haasbot algorithmic trading software, created by Haasonline, trades bitcoin and over 500 altcoins on many popular exchanges. This includes fully automated trades on platforms such as GDAX, Poloniex, Bitfinex, Kraken, Huobi, BTCC, Gemini and much more. Haasonline details the bot is customizable and enables a variety of technical indicator tools. “Our bitcoin bot utilizes industry leading indicators such as StochRSI, MACD-Histogram, PPO, Ultimate Oscillator, Ulcer Index, Regression Slope Cross, and more,” explains Haasonline.  BTC Robot BTC Robot considers itself the world’s first electronic cryptocurrency robot. The trading robot offers multiple plans for different types of software and membership. The cheapest robot plan is US$149 for the silver software, which gives traders a downloadable version for various Windows operating systems. Mac users have to pay a touch more. The company notes that its algorithmic trading does not predict markets perfectly, and there will always be losing and winning trades. It further added that: Cryptotrader Cryptotrader is a cloud-based automated bitcoin trading bot that claims to allow users to build algorithmic trading programs in minutes. The company also offers a “Strategy Marketplace” where users can purchase and sell trading strategies. Cryptotrader says that it is supported by most of the popular exchanges such as Coinbase, BTCe, Bitstamp, and more. The business states that its automated trading bots in are unique compared to the current bots on the market today.  Bot trading may not be for everyone as the software can be difficult for inexperienced traders to understand. Furthermore, traders have to trust in the efficiency and reliability of companies or the free software that offers algorithmic cryptocurrency trading. There are many different businesses online offering bot services, and some of them may not be legitimate. Alongside this, free trading bot programs can be found on sites like Sourceforge, but people should research diligently before trusting any free software. However, reputable and functioning trading bots may increase trade profits, if used correctly. What do you think about trading bots? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-03-26T04:30:12-04:00,Where Do You Stand on the Yin & Yang of Different Bitcoin Ideologies?,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-recent-etf-decision-highlighted-the-yin-yang-of-different-bitcoin-ideologies/,"Just recently the cryptocurrency community experienced a very hyped up psychological situation concerning the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). The bottom line was whether or not the status quo would accept the decentralized currency into their lair. Also read: Deloitte Accepts Bitcoin at its Restaurant Due to ‘A Lot of Requests’ Over the past few months, bitcoin’s price has been on a tear. During this time people have speculated part of the reason the price spiked was due to the March Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) decision. The psychology of this matter ran deep as people wondered if bitcoin would be accepted by mainstream investors. While people waited for the decision, many people got excited and hoped the SEC would approve the ETF. Throughout forums and social media one could see countless posts and articles covering the subject. Many hoped the chance of approval would send bitcoin to the moon. On March 10, the day of the ETF announcement, the subreddit r/bitcoin had over 2500 subscribed readers online simultaneously, who likely were waiting for the decision. Before the SEC decision day, there were also a few bitcoiners who either didn’t think it was the right time for a bitcoin ETF or didn’t want it at all. Serial entrepreneur Vinny Lingham wrote an opinion piece on why he didn’t think 2017 was the year for a bitcoin ETF. Before the decision, there were many other talking points saying a Bitcoin ETF may be a bad idea.  Following the SEC rejection, a post on Reddit had a vast majority of people saying “we don’t need SEC approval.” One interesting comment stated that the tone of comments probably would’ve been entirely different if the SEC had approved the fund. You have to wonder how many people were cheering for an ETF weeks prior and then said “screw SEC” immediately after. It’s interesting to see this type of psychology concerning joining status quo or eradicating the system. A while back I uploaded a picture I created of 60 banks invested in blockchain technology to see if I could get a reaction. I did this as an experiment to see whether or not it would gain traction with the crowd. Immediately the picture went viral and received 50 thousand views in twenty-four hours. The graphic was interestingly popular even though it was posted to a bitcoin-focused forum that typically dismisses altcoins and blockchain projects. However, every single one of those banks pictured have absolutely nothing to do with bitcoin, but the image was still a crowd pleaser. Currently, there is a yin and yang of differing ideological foundations when it comes to people’s views of what bitcoin is meant to do. You can see these differences across the web throughout many bitcoin forums and chat groups. The fact is there are many individuals who wish and pray bitcoin will be accepted by the status quo. They believe the banksters and bureaucracy will ‘legitimize’ bitcoin. Many of them really hoped the bitcoin ETF would have been approved on March 10 and accepted by the financial incumbents. Then, on the other hand, there are those who vehemently oppose banks and governments coming near the decentralized currency. These types of people believe bitcoin was meant to replace the greedy middlemen and bring economic sovereignty back to the people. This means that quite a few members of the `Bitcoin community´ (myself included at times) suffer from cognitive dissonance or the act of simultaneously holding two contradictory beliefs at the same time. It’s hard to toss the shackles of society’s traditional norms when the nation states and central banks bolster these beliefs with laws and indoctrination.  The status quo uses multiple types of propaganda, such as protectionism, to make people feel like they can’t do things on their own. In fact, their ridiculous assumptions explain that individuals who privately hold wealth are a dangerous threat to society and must be evading taxes. For instance, last year former U.S. President Barack Obama stated;   “What mechanisms do we have available to do even simple things like tax enforcement?” asked Obama. “If in fact, you can’t crack that all, if the government can’t get in, then everybody is walking around with a Swiss Bank account in their pocket.” With these two very distinct and contrasting ideologies within the bitcoin space — The question is where do you stand? What do you think about the psychological aspects of Bitcoin being accepted by the status quo? Do you feel Bitcoin doesn’t need this acceptance or permission? Let us know in the comments below.

In fact, there are many exciting products for geeky hobbyists already available today that can be purchased with bitcoin. Also Read: Zeronet Wants to Replace the Dark Web by Marrying Bitcoin to Bittorrent Over Tor Lasers It is now possible for bitcoiners to become their favorite Star Wars character by purchasing a laser with their digital currency stash. Bitlasers.com is a business that specializes in laser sales and accepts a variety of cryptocurrencies. For instance, for roughly 0.0986 BTC bitcoin enthusiasts can purchase a handheld laser with an optical power of around 1300 mW. The laser is dubbed “Bitbrew” after one of the company’s favorite coffee shops that accepts bitcoin. Bitbrew has a laser wavelength of 445 nm and comes in a bright fluorescent-like blue color. Bitlasers also has more expensive and more powerful lasers available for bitcoin, but the company warns these products are not toys. If a user is not careful, these lasers are capable of causing permanent blindness, as well as skin damage, and can severely burn people and objects. Diving Machines and Mini-Submarines If someone is looking to go nautical with their bitcoins they may want to visit the website Bitpremier, which calls itself the “luxury marketplace for bitcoiners.” Of course, people can buy fancy automobiles and yachts on the website, but they can also purchase submarines to voyage into the deep depths of the ocean blue. For instance, one ad on Bitpremier is selling an “Ultimate Diving Machine” that resembles a submarine shaped like a shark. For 115 BTC a bitcoiner can purchase this two-seater craft with a bubble top canopy. It has an underwater camera system, many viewports, snorkel extensions, and also comes with a custom shark paint job and a trailer. If you have deeper pockets and want to purchase a professional grade mini-submarine for 2,271 bitcoins, Bitpremier can help you there as well. The mini-submarines are capable of diving down to a depth of “100 meters to 300 meters with three people.” The Bitpremier ad states these mini submersibles are fast, with six thrusters for strong currents and small enough to fit on an existing super-yacht. Anyone who is looking to fulfill their Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea fantasies can do so now with bitcoin. A Trip to Space Are you looking to leave the earth’s atmosphere with your bitcoins? Look no further, as Virgin Galactic will take you there and is currently accepting bitcoin for space flight purchases. Virgin Galactic is owned by the well-known Bitcoin supporter Sir Richard Branson. The Virgin space team has been building a spacecraft that can handle human spaceflight operations and small satellite launches. As a forward thinking company, Virgin Galactic believes utilizing bitcoin as payment for spaceflight is only natural.     “Bitcoin, the virtual currency, has really captured the imagination recently as one of the world’s most innovative businesses looking to the future,” explains Virgin Galactic. “So we think it is about time Virgin Galactic customers can choose to pay with bitcoins.” Drones and Robotics Now that you have a lightsaber, submarine, and a plane ticket to space you may need some friendly robot companions. Currently, Bitcoin enthusiasts can purchase flying drones with their digital currency and test their skills at aerial filming, and delivery services. The UK-based Daedalus Group has been selling drones for over two years and sells the flying robots for bitcoins. Furthermore, the company has stated in the past that both technologies will help each other grow. Additionally, the Virginia-based Expert Drones accepts the decentralized currency for drone purchases. The company specializes in drone kits, accessories, repairs, and training for both novices and veteran drone experts. Or maybe you are in the market for a robotic arm after your father chopped yours off because you didn’t join him in ruling the empire? Well, in that case, you can purchase an arm that utilizes artificial intelligence, with bitcoin. While perusing on the bitcoin merchant website Spendabit there are quite a few robotic arms for sale, and accessories. Those shopping for a robotic arm could choose the Phantom X Pincher that operates with Turtlebot software and offers five degrees of movement freedom. Medieval Weapons Maybe space and underwater science fiction isn’t your thing, and you’re a geek who appreciates medieval weaponry and Lord of the Rings re-enactment gear. Well, you could possibly fill your Brave Heart desire by spending your bitcoins at the Celtic Webmerchant which carries early medieval swords, Viking weapons, and more. Furthermore, after branding a fine blade bitcoiners can also obtain medieval jewelry, drinking horns, and oil and stones to sharpen your battle-axe. There are loads of other nerdy gadgets that can be purchased with bitcoin and this is just the tip of the iceberg. Bitcoiners can also purchase comic books, Pokemon cards, weird tee-shirts, funky art pieces and many more geeky items with the decentralized currency. With Bitcoin being considered a currency for geeks, being able to purchase items that exemplify this nerdiness is a plus.

2017-03-24T13:35:17-04:00,Markets Update: Bitcoin’s Price and Market Share Dominance Declines,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/markets-update-bitcoin-price-market-share-dominance-declines/,"A lot has changed in regards to the price of bitcoin over the course of the past week. Since our last markets report, bitcoin markets have seen quite a few price fluctuations as the cryptocurrency’s future value remains uncertain. Also read: Trezor Redesigns Wallet Interface and Adds Advanced Recovery Feature If one were to ignore the scaling debate this week and focus the attention entirely on cryptocurrency markets, one would notice last week’s bitcoin price movements were just as hectic. Currently, the price per bitcoin is US$990, after losing roughly $70 dollars in value over the past 24 hours. Just one week ago, on March 16, bitcoin’s price was coasting along at $1,215-1,235 per BTC – but it took a significant dive the following day. The bearish downturn continued until March 18, hitting a low of $950 per BTC, which turned out to be the week’s price floor so far. After the dip, the price started to ascend upwards once again, climbing above the 4-digit range. On March 21 bitcoin’s rising price reached $1,115 but subsequently took another downturn over the course of the next few days. At present technical indicators are showing sellers are in control of the market. The price is moving down to support lines as the psychological 4-digit range seems to be broken leading to the current bear market. The support line is strong in the $870-890 range, and its likely buyers are waiting for this position. The 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) is lower than the 200 SMA showing the seller’s market may continue until a new price floor is found. During most of the week a vast majority of bitcoiners have been discussing the scaling debate and the possibility of a hard fork. Many conversations on both sides of the block size debate have seen increased tension and animosity. This week a good portion of well-known bitcoin exchanges have detailed their contingency plans concerning a possible hard fork in the near future. Lots of bitcoin proponents believe a fork could happen soon and have begun discussing all the possible variables of a blockchain split event.  In other news, the recent rejection of the bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) is being disputed by the Bats BZX Exchange. The organization is petitioning the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to review its disapproval decision. Bats is looking for specific findings and factual evidence concerning the reasoning behind the ETF rejection. SEC initially detailed they had denied the ETF because of regulatory concerns. Last week Bitcoin.com reported on the rise of many alternative digital token capitalizations and the significant increase in cryptocurrency daily trading volumes. Overall cryptocurrency markets reached a high of $1 billion in trade volumes per day this week and currently rests at over $700 million, at the time of writing.  Quite a few individual cryptocurrency markets experienced exponential price rises this week with altcoins like Ethereum and Dash having field days. Ethereum is currently trading at $47 per ether and is capturing $200 million in daily trade volume. Some have speculated that Ethereum’s spike may be due to the darknet marketplace (DNM) Alphabay adding ether to the DNMs payment options. While many commenters have been highlighting the rise of the number three cryptocurrency Dash, the altcoin Ripple has suddenly leaped forward. This, the fourth highest valued token, has seen a significant 25 percent price increase and may soon be valued at one cent per unit. Other altcoins on the top ten list such as Ethereum Classic, Monero, and Augur have seen a few price spikes this week as well. Some believe Augur’s price is being pushed by the sudden Ethereum market uptrend due to its collaborative relationship.  Overall the entire market capitalization of all the existing cryptocurrencies combined has increased to over $23 billion. However bitcoin’s market dominance, the total amount of market share BTC holds compared to all the other alternative digital assets, stands at its lowest point ever. In fact, altcoins now hold more than 30 percent of the total market share, with bitcoin only grasping 68 percent of the entire market capitalization value. Traders playing scalps and breaks will do well with bitcoin’s price volatility as the market has plenty of room for intra-range strategies. Leading exchanges which offer futures options show quite a few more ‘short’ contracts than ‘long’ contracts as the bear market continues. At the moment bitcoin’s price is down 6 percent, but volume is holding strong with over $300 million in 24-hour trade volume. Currently, technical indicators show the market is uncertain and bitcoin traders should expect continued volatility.         Bear scenario: The downtrend could lead bitcoin’s price to a low of $870-900 per BTC with a possible uptrend at that support line. At the time of writing it is a seller’s market and the currency’s fall below the psychological $1,000 range is not a good sign.     Bull scenario: Bitcoin’s price could hold at the current $990 range and see a price upswing after some relatively stable sideways action. In the short term, if buyers regain some control, market prices could once again break the 4-digit range.       Disclaimer: Bitcoin price articles are intended for informational purposes only and should not to be considered as trading advice.

Bitcoin.com talked to Iliana Oris Valiente, ‎Strategy and Execution Lead and co-founder at Rubix by Deloitte, to find out the reason behind this decision and how much interest in Bitcoin the firm is seeing. Also read: How to Start Your Own Bitcoin ATM Business  Bistro 1858 is a private restaurant exclusively for Deloitte employees and their guests. There is a security guard at the entrance of the restaurant that will turn everyone else away, wrote the Toronto Star. Unlike most private restaurants that are tucked away from public view, this restaurant is in, what the paper calls, “a most public place” in Toronto. It is located in the Bay Adelaide Center, in the city’s financial district. Its all-glass walls make the dining area visible to anyone passing by. The tower is located at the northwest corner of Yonge and Adelaide Street. “Bistro 1858 has a seating capacity of 75 with take-out options”, Valiente described to Bitcoin.com. “Breakfast and lunch ranges from approximately $3 to $12 for snacks and meals”, she said, adding that: The restaurant’s co-operators, Deloitte and Benchmark Hospitality, have selected Bitpay to accept and settle bitcoin payments. Deloitte does not offer its own wallet, Valiente said. “There are many great Bitcoin wallets available out there so we didn’t find it necessary to recreate the wheel and build a new wallet”. The restaurant does not offer any incentives such as discounts for customers paying with bitcoin. “Our practitioners are encouraged to share the news with their clients and host them at Bistro 1858”, she further conveyed, noting that: Last September, Deloitte became the first of the Big 4 consultancy firms to install a Bitcoin ATM. Located in its Toronto office, Deloitte’s BTM is operated by the firm’s blockchain team at Rubix. Its fees are 4 percent to buy bitcoin and no fee for selling bitcoin, according to data from Coinatmradar. A mobile phone number and an ID are required to use the BTM and there is a daily limit of $100 per person. “As the most successful large implementation of blockchain technology, Bitcoin is consistently a topic of discussion at Deloitte and with our clients”, Valiente revealed, adding that: What do you think of Deloitte’s Bistro accepting bitcoin?

2017-03-23T14:00:17-04:00,Seattle-Based Cannabis Merchants are Accepting Bitcoin for Pot Sales,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/seattle-cannabis-merchants-accepting-bitcoin-pot-sales/,"Two months ago Bitcoin.com reported on the State of Washington giving marijuana dispensaries approval to accept bitcoin for cannabis sales. Now, thanks to a fintech startup called Posabit, a few cannabis merchants in Seattle are utilizing the decentralized currency in their business operations. Also read: AML-Compliant Bitcoin Payments Coming to 56,000+ Merchants Globally Many cryptocurrency enthusiasts would love to see the Bitcoin industry join together with the growing marijuana movement, which is happening in a few U.S. states. The State of Washington has allowed medical and recreational marijuana sales since 2014. Just recently, Washington lawmakers and the state’s Liquor and Cannabis Board gave marijuana merchants and payment processors the approval to utilize digital currencies for dispensary sales. Since then the startup Posabit, a credit-card-to-bitcoin payment processor, has begun working with four Seattle dispensaries which sell marijuana. The pot shops working with the Posabit system include the Queen Anne Cannabis Company, Herb’s House, Greener Today, and three Uncle Ike’s locations. Posabit claims to give cannabis merchants and other brick and mortar stores an easier way to accept credit cards and bitcoin at any point of sale location. Furthermore, the company says using their digital processor reduces cash transactions, which can be a danger for cannabis dispensary employees.  The Posabit experience allows users to purchase bitcoins with a credit card and use them to purchase goods from a cannabis location with a Posabit kiosk. In essence, the startup says that they remove the issues of using credit cards for pot sales by utilizing a legal cryptocurrency, because cannabis credit card sales are prohibited by law. “We are selling bitcoin to [individual] customers, and allow our [pot store] customers to accept bitcoin as payment,” co-founder Ryan Hamlin tells Seattle Weekly. “Obviously federal laws prohibit using credit cards to purchase cannabis,” Hamlin adds. “That’s exactly what we’re not doing.” Another benefit to the Posabit system is that the business is fully compliant with KYC, AML, and OFAC regulatory guidelines, explains the startup. Additionally, Posabit details its real-time transaction history provides a transparent reporting system for auditing. The startup believes that there are a few types of merchants that could use the Posabit infrastructure at point of sale locations. The three types of businesses that may benefit from Posabit’s bitcoin payment system include: There have been many Bitcoin proponents trying to push for these two industries to join hands, and it seems like the idea may continue to prosper. One of the biggest concerns for merchants in states where marijuana is legal is the large amounts of cash being stored onsite and transported offsite to banks. This type of practice opens the dispensary to dangers such as being robbed and other forms of cash losses. Posabit’s co-founder says that he saw “an industry that was in dire need of a credit solution.” Hamlin adds, “I said, ‘software has got to be able to solve this problem.’” What do you think about Posabit and Seattle cannabis dispensaries accepting bitcoin for reefer sales?

2017-03-23T04:22:19-04:00,Bats Exchange Fights Back Against SEC’s Decision to Reject Bitcoin ETF,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bats-exchange-secs-decision-reject-bitcoin-etf/,"Bats BZX Exchange has submitted a “notice of intention to petition for review of order disapproving” its proposed rule change to list and trade Coin ETF by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Also read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF National law firm Schiff Hardin LLP faxed its letter as well as a letter written by Bats BZX Exchange to the SEC on March 17, but they were not published on the SEC’s website until early this week. Bats Exchange’s letter officially serves as a “notice of intention to petition for review of order disapproving a proposed rule change” pertaining to the listing and trading of Coin ETF which the Commission rejected on March 10. The SEC’s disapproval decision was made by “the Division of Trading and Markets pursuant to delegated authority”. The exchange cites Rule 430(b)(1) of the SEC’s Rules of Practice in its letter, which details the procedure for an ‘appeal of actions made pursuant to delegated authority’. This rule states that “a party to an action made pursuant to delegated authority, or a person aggrieved by such action, may seek Commission review of the action by filing a written notice of intention to petition for review”. The letter also states that: “Bats intends to file separately a petition for review in accordance with Rule 430(b)(2) of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s Rules of Practice”. Rule 430(b)(2) outlines the procedure of how to actually petition for review. It reads: In addition, the petition must include “exceptions to any findings of fact or conclusions of law made, together with supporting reasons for such exceptions based on appropriate citations to such record as may exist. These reasons may be stated in summary form”, according to the rule. Once the petition is filed, the SEC will determine whether to grant a review. If it is found that the Commission’s staff had reached an erroneous conclusion of law by misapplying the Exchange Act standards application to the proposed rule change, then a review would be granted. Subsequently, the Commission may “affirm, reverse, modify, set aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, any action” made by the delegated authority. In rejecting Coin ETF, the SEC ruled that Bats Exchange must “have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading” bitcoin or its derivatives, and that bitcoin markets must be regulated. However, it found that “the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated”, therefore there could not be the type of surveillance-sharing agreements needed to be consistent with the Exchange Act. Bats had already tried to convince the SEC that there is a comprehensive surveillance-sharing agreement in place to monitor the trading of Coin ETF on its exchange, but it failed to convince the SEC the first time. In the exchange’s petition which should be filed by the end of the week, Bats Exchange will have to convince the SEC that a review is warranted. While Bats Exchange is fighting to reverse the SEC’s decision to reject Coin ETF, NYSE Arca is waiting to hear the Commission’s decision on its proposed rule change to list and trade Solidx Bitcoin Trust which is due on March 30. The Community has already been expecting the SEC to reject that proposed rule change as well. Do you think Bats Exchange will be able to convince the SEC to reverse its decision? Let us know in the comments section below.

Thousands of global merchants rely on ACI to execute $14 trillion each day in payments and securities. With a market capitalization of over $2.5 billion, Forbes ranks ACI #45 on its list of America’s Best Small Companies. The company announced on Wednesday that: These PSPs already offer credit and debit card checkout functionality to merchants around the world. This collaboration between ACI and Payment21 “allows PSPs and merchants to quickly and easily add bitcoin payments to their checkout pages, without additional integrations”, the announcement reads. “The solution includes inbound payments and payouts in bitcoin offering real-time settlement capabilities on a global scale, which accelerates merchant cash flow”. ACI’s vice president, Andy McDonald, explained that this solution will enable their PSP clients to “offer AML-compliant bitcoin payments all without exposing their merchants to price volatility.” Payment21 focuses on “the compliance needs of enterprise-level businesses and the legal prerequisites of their banking partners”, the company describes. Its target clientele are publicly-listed companies, licensed gaming operators, concessionary wireless network providers, authorized investment funds and their banking partners. Moving Media Gmbh, which owns the Payment21 brand, is a registered financial intermediary with the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). The company is based in Switzerland with an International Sales Organization (ISO) in the US. The company’s system caters to global Know-Your-Customer (KYC) regulations in European and international jurisdictions. “This, together with no chargeback risk, makes enabling bitcoin payments an effective solution for merchants that are seeking to address traditional points of friction—including delays and costs associated with cross-border payments”, said Bernhard Kaufmann, general manager of Payment21.

2017-03-22T15:00:17-04:00,Miner Michael Myers on Bitcoin Block Scaling,Michael Myers,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-block-scaling/,"As I read the Bitcoin news each day and see the price of bitcoin cycling up and down, I’ve been thinking about the different sides of the blockchain scaling debate, and wondering what the best solution is for miners. While I realize that many of us signal (via our pool) our support of one proposal or another, a stable consensus seems elusive. As support for one proposal shifts to another, the forces that represent one idea or another shift to a different adoption method, and that can be frustrating for those of us who have had to change pools and reconfigure, in some cases, many miners. I consider myself a hobbyist. I have 20 or so miners, most of which only support SHA256, in a colo. But when I add things up, I easily have more than $30k invested in my mining hardware. If you say it out loud, it feels like a huge investment, and if bitcoin were to suddenly go insolvent due to a hard fork, or fundamentally, bickering, it would indeed be a huge loss to me and my family. This is why I think it so important for all of us to think very seriously about the future of bitcoin. People talk about all sorts of things—payment systems, etc.—but the thing that really matters, from my point of view, is the public ledger. In my day job, I am in charge of enterprise architecture for a major corporation. This corporation, like so many others, invests capital in innovation and research, and blockchain technology is a focus of some of these investments. But no matter what types of blockchain tech you’re looking at, the “big” blockchain is bitcoin. For now. In order for bitcoin to maintain its dominance, it needs to scale to multiple applications—not just rest on its first “killer app,” which is the coin itself. When we look at off-chain scaling solutions, the big concern I have is how many alternative chains will exist. When those chains begin to pick up on the opportunity inherent in non-coin transactions, we, as miners, have lost the battle. The major source of fees in the long term will evaporate into the pockets of the people who run those alternate chains. Last week, we all had the opportunity to hear what exchanges were going to do if there was a fork. Then exchanges said that the document they had signed maybe didn’t look the same as it did when it was signed. Why was the document’s hash not published to the blockchain? Why weren’t the signatures cryptographic? Why can’t we have an irrefutable record of who signed exactly what? We can’t because there is no room. That document’s hash would have cost an unrealistic amount of money to embed due to current size restrictions and the ridiculous backlog of data waiting for a block. Perhaps the exchanges could have used an alternate blockchain. I am sure Ethereum would love to have that business. The truth though, is that business should be ours. With a variable block size, companies and individuals would have the ability to embed transactions of all types into the blockchain. Such transactions will just become more pervasive over time and along with the coin economy would drive huge fees due to volume, not scarcity, to our mining community. Anyone who has attached themselves to the scarcity wagon is in for a rude surprise. Someone is always willing to do something cheaper. Sometimes they can even do it cheaper and better. Let’s not give up our dominate position as the main blockchain that everyone wants their transactions written to. Take time, and make a choice—a choice that will promote our long-term position as the coin, and the blockchain for the future. If, as miners, we don’t act now, I assure you, someone will make a choice for us, and it won’t be the best long-term choice for our wallets. This is an Op-ed article.

Also Read:Â The New 110% Unlimited Bitcoin.com Mining Pool is Now Open to Everyone Nodecounter is a graphical data site that records the Bitcoin networkâs node count across a variety of different Bitcoin clients. This includes protocols such as Bitcoin Unlimited (BU), XT, Core, Classic, and unknown nodes throughout the network. Additionally, Nodecounter manages a rented mining donation operation that utilizes funds to mine bitcoins. Over the past year, the organization has been mining with Slush Pool originally supporting Bitcoin Classic blocks but have since switched to the BU protocol. More recently Nodecounter says that Slush Poolâs operator has used slander against BU supporters and the insults have gone on long enough.  Nodecounter explains that the organization believes in free market choice, rather than the edicts of pool operators, and will now mine with Bitcoin.comâs mining pool.Â âBitcoin has become far too political,â explains Nodecounter. The data website and mining multi-pool details that Slushâs statements are misleading and BU supporters are not against second layer solutions. Nodecounter believes second layer scaling can be achieved with âsimpler malleability fixesâ as many BU supporters believe Segwit is too complex.  âRather than attempting to change Slush’s mind, we are simply moving our hashrate elsewhere,â Nodecounter says. Nodecounter reports thatÂ the mining donation fund has been very successful as the organization has mined over 736 BTC or roughly US$750,000 in rewards. âThe efficiency of this mining fund is very high, and it has proven that it can re-invest for over six months off a single donation,â explains Nodecounter. The organization details that all they want is for Bitcoin to `be great againÂ´, with low fees, fast confirmations, and more Â use cases. Nodecounter also believes scaling and second layer solutions can be achieved if developers didn’t support âcensored discussion areas.â Nodecounter adds, âThis is the same Bitcoin we have all known and loved for years.â What do you think about Nodecounter switching mining pools?

2017-03-22T10:00:05-04:00,3 Free Bitcoin Direct Payment Processors for Webmasters,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/free-bitcoin-direct-payment-processors-webmasters/,"There are countless Bitcoin payment processing services, applications, and plugins to enable websites to accept bitcoin payments for goods and services. However, most of them require webmasters to sign up as customers and pay fees on each transaction, similar to legacy banking services or Paypal. This article examines a few Bitcoin applications that can give webmasters total control over processing payments online. Also Read: Zeronet Wants to Replace the Dark Web by Marrying Bitcoin to Bittorrent Over Tor To accept bitcoin payments on a website, webmasters can either sign up for a third-party service or they can install an application to do the job themselves. Website payment processors tell e-commerce programs like a merchant shop or a sales widget when a payment has been successfully received so that the goods or services can be released to the customer. Processors for accepting bitcoin payments have different features than fiat processors. For example, they need to generate new Bitcoin addresses for each customer to preserve the webmaster’s privacy, or generate a QR code payment address – which could even pass along pricing information. They also keep up with currency conversion, therefore allowing items’ prices to be listed in fiat currency, but still be paid in bitcoin. In addition, they preserve Bitcoin’s feature to evade censorship and their code is open source, like Bitcoin, so webmasters can rest assured that the code contains no hidden backdoors that could steal payments. Compared to debit cards, there is no identification info to be hacked or compromised in other ways. Below are three direct Bitcoin payment processors available today for free that can do the job described above. Better known for their popular smartphone wallet, Mycelium offers the Gear merchant processing solution that is free and only needs an email address to create an account. It offers a customizable widget for many types of websites and several content management plugins like WordPress, Joomla! and Drupal. However, it requires wallets that support BIP32 public keys like Electrum or their own wallet in order to generate unique addresses for each customer. Gear offers an admin dashboard on its website which shows an order book of all transaction history, and a configuration suite for widgets and custom gateways. It also offers extra security features like two-factor authorization and joint escrow accounts. Moreover, the platform can automatically send mass payouts to multiple recipients with preserved privacy. The app also integrates with bitcoin-to-euro conversion service, Cashilla, to allow fiat payouts in euro for users living in Europe. Popular blockchain explorer Blockonomics offers their own merchant processing application, which is accessible through their dashboard. Also requiring BIP32-ready wallets for processing, Blockonomics has integrated with fewer widgets and platforms than Mycelium. In addition to offering an order history, the application has some unique features such as charting, an address watcher and a transaction fee wizard. While free at first, Blockonomics does charge a subscription fee after the first 50 public key addresses it generates. The service has five tiers of membership that include additional features such as custom invoicing and technical support. Bitcoin Payments is a free and simple WordPress plugin that is powerful enough to generate custom addresses and QR codes but it has not been updated in over 2 years and may have compatibility issues when used with more recent versions of WordPress. The plugin can place payment boxes anywhere on a website. While it does not offer an order history page or advanced dashboard feature like the other two processors, it is not connected to any other websites which makes it ideal for webmasters who are concerned with privacy.

2017-03-22T07:00:31-04:00,Only 807 People Have Declared Bitcoin for Tax Purposes According to IRS,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/807-people-declared-bitcoin-tax-purposes-according-irs/,"Only 807 people have declared Bitcoin for tax purposes, according to court documents filed by the IRS in San Francisco. If true, it is likely only a tiny percentage of virtual currency users have reported profits and losses in their annual income forms.  Also read: Some Blockchain Tokens are Securities, Researchers Find  Filed in San Francisco federal court on Thursday, the new documents further shed light on the reason why IRS has asked Coinbase to hand over a broad range of customer data, including every customer account and detailed transaction records over a considerable period. Coinbase pledged to fight the request. In a new affidavit from IRS agent David Utzke, he discovered that fewer than a thousand people filed a Form 8480 to account for a “property description likely related to bitcoin.” The affidavit reads: “The IRS searched the MTRDB for Form 8949 data for tax years 2013 through 2015. I received the results of those searches. Those results reflect that in 2013, 807 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; in 2014, 893 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin; and in 2015, 802 individuals reported a transaction on Form 8949 using a property description likely related to bitcoin.” Coinbase said on Friday it has yet to hand over information. “Coinbase remains concerned with the indiscriminate and over broad scope of the government’s summons and we have produced no records under the summons,” wrote Coinbase lawyer, Juan Suarez.  According to a Fortune source, the IRS and Coinbase have been in talks over what information exactly the digital currency exchange would provide.  The IRS received approval from a California federal court last November – just in time for tax season – to serve a so-called John Doe summons on Coinbase to determine whether or not Bitcoin users are declaring their virtual currency.  Bitcoiners “may fail, or may have failed, to comply with one or more provisions of the internal revenue laws,” the IRS opined in 2015. The IRS has therefore requested user records between 2013-2015 from Coinbase, including transaction history, IP addresses and transcripts with customer support. Many Bitcoiners, to be sure, complain the IRS never provided guidance, even though requested by academics and accountants several years ago. Brian Armstrong, Coinbase founder and CEO, publicly rebuked the subpoena. “Asking for detailed transaction information on so many people, simply for using digital currency, is a violation of their privacy, and is not the best way for us to accomplish our mutual objective,” he wrote on Medium. He added: “The IRS incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes.”  Tax industry organizations have called for more clarity when it comes to Bitcoin taxes. “Creating a taxation framework that is stable and standardized, adaptable to digital trends, and maintains basic privacy standards is key to the broader development of the US bitcoin industry,” wrote the Americans for Tax Reform. It could be, of course, that the IRS’ subpoena to Coinbase is their way of telling Bitcoiners in general that this is the year to start declaring.

2017-03-22T04:00:19-04:00,Social Website Based on Bitcoin Prepares to Soft-Launch With Free Off-Chain Transactions,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/a-social-media-website-based-on-bitcoin-prepares-to-soft-launch/,"A new social media website, called Yours, has quietly launched on Bitcoin’s testnet. For Bitcoiners, that might mean within the next few months off-chain, peer-to-peer bitcoin micropayments on a social network. Yours claims to offer an “array of payment models”, which allow content creators to make money. Also Read: Is Bitcoin the Currency of Artificial Intelligence?  “Our centerpiece is the purchase model, which is very simple,” explains Mr. Charles, who once worked as Reddit’s cryptocurrency engineer. “Everybody who posts content to Yours – including articles, video, images, audio – can pick a place in their content to put a pay wall.” Users set the price of their own content. “So, if you write a compelling article with a cliffhanger, you can hide the conclusion behind, say, a ten cent pay wall.”  Yours, as well, will offer a micro-payments wallet. This has proven a controversial technical arena in the Bitcoin universe. In recent years, as increasing amounts of throughput have been introduced to Bitcoin, the cost of transactions have gone up. Tiny transactions are no longer cost-effective on Bitcoin. Yours seeks to repair this.  “We have developed a smart contract network on Bitcoin similar to the Lightning Network,” Mr. Charles tells Bitcoin.com. “Except our protocol is not dependent on Segwit and can run on bitcoin today.”  This will be very useful for some Bitcoin users who find the current fee environment to be too high. “Yours allows users to possess their private keys and have full custodial control over their funds at all times, while being able to participate in off-chain zero fee transactions with other users,” Mr. Charles tells Bitcoin.com.  Developing a micro-payments platform was not easy for Yours. “Our smart contract system is several times more complicated than a normal Bitcoin wallet,” according to Mr. Charles. With the Yours testnet launched, anybody can pay for content, but not everyone can post.  “If you want to post, you will have to do a one-on-one demo with us so that we can get your real-time feedback about the experience,” Mr. Charles explains.  There are numerous models allowing individuals to get paid on Yours, including paywalls on content. Further, a classic endorsement model will allow content creators to earn as users pay to upvote their content. Another model sees readers pay to see ads. Commenters can earn when their comments are upvoted. Individuals can also invest in a creator’s content, in order to earn returns on that content’s income over time. Overall, Mr. Charles is trying to take Yours slowly.  “We need a slow influx of users to help us identify the most important bugs before launching to a large audience,” he says.

Now on March 21, Guo has announced he will be making the jump towards voting for BU with his mining pool’s hashpower. Also Read: This Happens to Your Coins During a Bitcoin Hard Fork Over the past two months, there has been a lot of support directed at the BU protocol as many miners have begun to vote for the bitcoin client. Last week the large mining pool Antpool pointed a majority of its hashpower towards BU. Antpool currently runs 19 percent of the global hashrate. Following Antpool’s decision to support BU, another mining operation called the Bitclub Network mined its first BU block on March 20. Bitclub Network’s pool commands 3.7 percent of the global hashrate and pool owners detailed they were frustrated with network congestion Last month Chandler Guo said he was creating a new mining pool and stated, “The pool will signal Bitcoin Unlimited.” Guo has always had strong opinions and is vocal within the cryptocurrency industry as he is well known for his stance during the Ethereum fork. On March 21 Guo revealed to his Twitter followers, he will now be directing his support towards the BU protocol. At press time 40.3 percent of blocks mined on March 21 supported BU. Pools signaling BU support include Viabtc, Antpool, Bitclub Network, Bitcoin.com, BTCtop, Canoe, GBminers, and Slush. With the additional push from Chandler Guo’s mining pool, more of the network’s hashrate will be added to BU support. If Guo follows through with his original plan and adds 100PH to his pool, the operation hopes it can accumulate a good percentage of the global hashrate in the near future. The Chinese investor is a big believer in the cryptocurrency revolution stating last year he believes the global GDP will be based on bitcoin. Guo also has a vested interest in Ethereum Classic (ETC) and has offered capital to ETC startups working with the protocol. With Guo’s pool soon to be pointing its hashrate at BU, it shows Guo is once again stating his opinion publicly but also backing up his words with hash power.

2017-03-20T19:00:46-04:00,This Happens to Your Coins During a Bitcoin Hard Fork and Possible Blockchain Split,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/this-happens-to-your-coins-during-a-bitcoin-hard-fork-and-possible-blockchain-split/,"Over the past two weeks, the bitcoin community has been discussing the possibility of a hard fork in the near future. Furthermore many industry exchanges and bitcoin-based businesses are already making preparations for such an event. A couple of questions bitcoin holders are asking are; Whether or not their bitcoins will be safe and what they should do during a blockchain split. Also Read: Popular Bitcoin Exchanges Reveal Controversial Hard Fork Contingency Plan The first and foremost piece of information all bitcoin holders should know is that in the event of a hard fork that splits the blockchain, bitcoins you possess will be perfectly safe.  Over the past year or so hard forks have gotten a bad reputation for political reasons, but in actuality, most types of forks are merely protocol upgrades. A blockchain split occurs during a hard fork which in turn branches the chain into two parts. If this happens, there is nothing a bitcoin holder has to do but wait and watch the fork unfold. The folks at the subreddit r/btc have compiled a very well written frequently asked questions post concerning protocol upgrades and how users are affected. The thread gives details about the hard fork process and what to expect.  When the blockchain branches into two there will be two digital assets immediately after the hard fork. Bitcoin holders who possess their private keys will have access to assets on both chains after the split event occurs. So, if you “keep your money” in a local wallet on your computer or on your phone you can just stay put and watch the fork happen. If you hold money on a bitcoin exchange, then it will be up to the exchange’s discretion on how they choose to disperse both token assets to customers. Most of the well-known industry exchanges have already pledged to support both assets if a blockchain split event takes place. Users should remember that holding cryptocurrency on an exchange is not recommended even during non-eventful times. As explained above, after a blockchain split customers storing bitcoin on an exchange will have to succumb to the rules of that specific trading platform. For instance, it’s highly possible that exchanges will pause withdrawals for 24-48 hours during and after the fork. Most reputable exchanges should and will likely disperse both assets to their customers sometime after the event, but users should expect a waiting period while the businesses assesses the situation.  The bitcoin exchange Coinbase explains the company’s current contingency plan to its customers concerning a hard fork and possible blockchain split which includes pausing deposits and withdrawals; “Ensuring the safety of customer funds is our top priority,” explains the San Francisco-based exchange. “In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, it is likely that Coinbase will temporarily suspend the deposit and withdrawal of bitcoin from the platform pending our assessment of the technical risks posed by any fork, such as the possibility of replay attacks, network instability, or other factors. Customers should take note that they will not be able to withdraw bitcoin from or deposit bitcoin to Coinbase for a period of up to 24 hours or more following the fork. In the event of a hard fork of the Bitcoin protocol, Coinbase may suspend the ability to buy or sell on our platform during this time.” The other twenty or so well-known bitcoin exchanges that revealed their hard fork contingency plans last week will also list both digital assets (creating another account for their customers, for the “new” forked coin). Yet it is safe to assume these exchanges will also pause deposits and withdrawals during a split event. Customers will have to follow the rules of the exchange they store their funds with, and each business will have different guidelines.  Users holding the private keys to their funds will have access to both chains after a split occurs. Depending on where the user stores their bitcoins they will have the means to access both digital assets by either waiting for wallet support or moving their funds to a different wallet platform that support both chains. For instance, the hardware wallet manufacturer Ledger explains what happens to people who possess their private keys using a cold storage device;   This logic applies to every user utilizing an application that allows exclusive bitcoin key possession. There is no risk of losing bitcoins during a hard fork, and over a period of time after a blockchain split, users will be able to access both chains. Forks are a part of most open source software protocols that mature, and many people believe bitcoin will experience a number of them in the future. Users should always consider possessing their own private keys at all times, so they have the ability to use their funds when they want instead of having to follow the guidelines of an exchange. There is plenty of material online for people to research what will happen during this type of event and many Bitcoin businesses have detailed their hard fork plans. Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen has also written an informative blog post in regards to what may happen to a majority and minority chain. Andresen speculates what may happen within the market as far as price value, but also assures bitcoin holders their assets will be safe in the event of a blockchain split.

2017-03-20T06:00:46-04:00,Bitcoin Developers Propose Changing Proof-of-Work Algorithm,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-developers-changing-proof-work-algorithm/,"As the Bitcoin’s scaling debate intensifies, many people are choosing sides and thinking of solutions that best suit their subjective opinions of how the network should operate. Now discussions on Bitcoin’s blockchain possibly forking has caused some people to consider trying to change the digital currency’s Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism. Also read: Bitpay Confident in Bitcoin, But Raises Its Minimum Transaction Size The past week in bitcoin-land it’s been quite a ride, to say the least. Scaling topics have now eclipsed all discussions concerning the March 10 ETF decision. Most of the “community” is now focused on the block size debate and the possibility of a hard fork in the near future. There are those who vehemently oppose a hard fork and have decided to come up with solutions to avoid the situation by proposing some ideas that are very controversial. This week community members and Bitcoin Core developers such as Luke-jr have been discussing trying to change Bitcoin’s Proof-of-Work (PoW) algorithm. Of course, the discussion of changing PoW has stirred contentious arguments once again. Many people within the community believe the PoW consensus mechanism is one foundation within Bitcoin’s code that should never change. However, the group discussing the algorithm change are afraid of “de facto control” by a great majority of the network hashrate. The group has pushed the conversation further by creating a website, and a Twitter handle to promote the idea. “A call for research, testing, and finally implementation of a decentralization-friendly algorithm for Bitcoin’s proof-of-work,” explains the BTC PoW Initiative website. “Bitcoin has been unable to implement a scaling solution due to greedy miners who want to keep fees high and who even mine empty blocks, not caring that it increases network congestion. — Changing the proof-of-work will fire the current crop of miners and open the door for quickly and easily scaling the network.” Almost immediately the community began yet another heated debate concerning this idea. A Bitfury employee, George Kikvadze, spoke against the PoW change rather sternly even saying some bitcoin community members could threaten those responsible with legal action. “Discussions (or even speculation) of a PoW change is super irresponsible! And even in the remote 0.01 percent chance it may happen — Those responsible, we will spare no resources, get best lawyers and prosecutors to go after you wherever you will be in the world,” Kikvadze said on Twitter. “Bitcoin has become a multi-billion industry, with great financial investment and societal responsibility. We will protect this at all cost!” Another bitcoin developer, Peter Todd, also promoted the BTC PoW Initiative to his Twitter followers on March 19. “With some miners threatening 51% attacks against Bitcoin, researching a PoW change is a good backup plan,” Todd states. However following this statement Todd details that changing the PoW consensus mechanism is risky. “Having said that, actually changing the PoW is a high-risk move; IMO best to only do that if an attack actually happens,” the developer added.   Lots of Bitcoin proponents across the web completely opposed the idea of a PoW change, while others thought the idea should be explored, and some explained the concept should truly be a last minute resort. One Redditor exclaimed that a “Proof of Work change is a HUGE controversial change!” However, bitcoin developer Luke-jr disagreed saying, “Much less controversial than block size increases — In any case, there is no client software being promoted here, merely consensus-building.” It’s clear from the many conversations across cryptocurrency forums and social media that a PoW algorithm change is a pretty touchy subject. Whether or not discussions like these go further and see actual development remains to be seen. What do you think about community members and developers discussing a PoW consensus mechanism change? Do you think the current PoW algorithm is a foundation that never should be changed? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Shutterstock, Twitter, and the BTC PoW Initiative website.

2017-03-20T04:00:23-04:00,Libertarian City Liberstad in Norway is Moving Forward Using Bitcoin as Primary Currency,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-libertarian-city-liberstad-in-norway-is-moving-forward-using-bitcoin-as-primary-currency/,"A project in rural Norway, Liberstad, aims to create a private, tax-free city for libertarians who respect the non-aggression principle and private property rights. Holding a presale now, the project’s organizers accept bitcoin for land and plan to make it the city’s primary currency. Bitcoin.com talked to John Holmesland, the general manager of the company that operates Liberstad, to learn more about how the project is progressing. Also read: Liberland: Bitcoin ‘Is Truly the Base of Our Economy’  Holmesland and his team started looking at properties for Liberstad in August 2015 and found Tjelland Farm with the appropriate “size, location, internet and electrical connection, water supply, good construction ground, and no permanent residents on the surrounding properties”, he told Bitcoin.com. An agreement was made to rent this property until May 19 to give them time to sell at least 15 hectares of plots, then buy the property for 5 million Norwegian kroner. For the presale, which started on August 15 last year, Holmesland said: Each plot of 1000m2 costs 35,000 NOK (about 4,000 USD), and the reserve price is 7,000 NOK (approx. 800 USD). If the land sale target is reached, development will start on June 1. After rezoning and waiting for the government to approve the development plan, Holmesland estimates that full development could begin within 24 to 36 months. During that time, the team plans to build roads, campsites and concert areas for landowners to use free of charge. Initially, the team aims to “create a completely private city where all land is privately owned, and all the public services are provided by private actors through voluntary means”, Holmesland shared, adding that: In Liberstad, basic city services such as kindergartens, schools, hospitals, retirement homes, private security service, garbage collection, arbitrary courts, and insurance companies will be provided “on the internal market or through voluntary organisations free from any tax, force or coercion”, he described. There have been over 500 inquiries and at least 120 people have placed an order, Holmesland revealed. From this group, 63 people have paid the deposit so far. He further detailed: Liberstad residents can become members of the Liberstad ‘internal-market’ business registry (LIMBR) which is “a closed market exclusive for the residents”, Holmesland described. Residents can use “whatever medium of exchange they want, except for national currencies”, he elaborated, noting that: Businesses wanting to accept Norwegian kroner have to “follow the Norwegian law and regulations and pay tax and VAT”, Holmesland conveyed, adding that they may also have to register with the Norwegian business registry. One business can have two registrations; one with the Norwegian government to accept Norwegian kroner and the other with LIMBR to accept anything else. The Liberstad team has established a Norwegian-registered nonprofit corporation called Liberstad Drift AS which is Liberstad’s operator, to provide and facilitate the city’s public services. Liberstad Drift AS can accept both NOK and bitcoin. VAT and other taxes that the state requires will be added for all kroner transactions. “We use Bitpay for all our Bitcoin transactions. We will also advise all other businesses in Liberstad to do the same”, Holmesland said. In addition, Liberstad Drift AS plans to give discounts to customers paying with bitcoin for all of its services once Liberstad is up and running. This is to encourage people to start using bitcoin, he explained, adding that: Liberstad’s future plans include educating and spreading information about economics and the benefits of the free markets and free-market money. “We also plan to use blockchain technology as a registration system for contracts, property deeds, IDs and more”, he revealed. Moreover, the team contemplates establishing their own local currency for the internal market that is backed or tied to bitcoin, so that transactions are faster and cheaper. The Marnardal Municipal government is responsible for rezoning, property tax and municipal services where Liberstad is located. “We started our dialog with local government before we signed the purchasing agreement and they were positive about our plans as the project will increase the population growth and activity in the municipality”, Holmesland claims. However, they have not opened a dialog with the national government about Liberstad. According to Holmesland, “Marnardal Municipality does not currently have property tax” and “there are no taxes or fees for owning plots in Liberstad”. While there is no guarantee of success, the team plans to work with the local government to ensure that there will be no property taxes added in the future. Two more libertarian land projects also propose using bitcoin as their primary currency. The most famous is Liberland, a whole startup country being developed on a small plot of land between Croatia and the Czech Republic. Lesser known, but further along, is the Fort Galt project in Valdivia, Chile. The new development, which has already purchased their land, is much closer to Liberstad in concept. It offers workplaces, vacation homes, and permanent residences to liberty lovers. While Liberland is still having issues with local governments not yet recognizing their sovereignty, Liberstad and Fort Galt both are working within existing governments to create oases of freedom.

On March 17 the mining pool Antpool had pointed 75 percent of its hashrate towards BU and by the end of the evening close to 90 percent was signaling BU support. Now the mining pool Bitclub is changing the game by mining a BU block when the organization previously mined using the Core client. The Bitclub Network’s pool currently holds 2.9 percent of the Bitcoin network’s global hashrate. This hashrate plus the added signal from Antpool will likely push the total BU support upwards. Currently, explicit mining pool support by proposal according to Coin Dance data shows BU is currently at 37 percent. Our sources have been in contact with the Bitclub Network operators, and they informed us of why they decided to switch proposal support. Bitclub says they have had significant issues with unconfirmed transactions. The Bitclub network has a lot of transactions going to and from its membership base, and new members began to have problems getting transactions confirmed. Two leading members of Bitclub spoke with our sources and explained their frustrations with the current network congestion. The slow network has been a significant inconvenience for Bitclub, and they told to our sources they are making the switch from Core to BU to help with the goal of upgrading the Bitcoin protocol to facilitate more transactions. Moreover, the leaders explained how they have been watching Ethereum trade volumes rising, and they are very concerned about bitcoin going down because of the state of the network. There seems to be a lot of bitcoin proponents concerned with the current state of protocol development with its rising fees and congestion issues taking place more frequently. Bitcoin businesses like Bitpay and Coinbase are changing their business models because network fees are too high for the companies to cover. Since the issues have become topics bitcoiners can’t avoid any more, node operators, and miners are taking action. Bitclub and Antpool’s latest support show these two pools have moved past conversations and have decided to use their hashrate as a voice of reason.

2017-03-19T09:56:31-04:00,Popular Bitcoin Exchanges Reveal Controversial Hard Fork Contingency Plan,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/popular-bitcoin-exchanges-reveal-controversial-hard-fork-contingency-plan/,"Over the past few days, the Bitcoin network scaling debate has been a viral topic as the community has begun deliberating the viability of a hard fork and a possible blockchain split. Also Read: Antpool Points 75% Hashpower at BU, While Exchanges Confirm Listing a Split On March 17 roughly twenty well-known exchanges released a statement concerning the possibility of a hard fork and a network split. The statement noted that the exchanges believe a hard fork is imminent and how their business plan looks in that situation. The exchanges that signed the letter of intent statement detailed their plans of listing both token assets if a blockchain split takes place. This would include asset listings for Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) protocols. Exchanges who signed the letter include Bitstamp, BTCC, Bitsquare, Shapeshift, Kraken, and more.   “We have decided to designate the Bitcoin Unlimited fork as BTU (or XBU),” explains the participating exchanges. “The Bitcoin Core implementation will continue to trade as BTC (or XBT), and all exchanges will process deposits and withdrawals in BTC even if the BTU chain has more hashing power.” However, the statement of how exchanges would designate the names of the tokens listed has become a contentious issue for those supporting BU. Furthermore, the community and two signatory exchanges had noticed that the letter of intent was altered after it was published. Both Shapeshift and Kraken who signed the letter stated there were changes made to the original document they had signed. The issue at hand was calling the Core protocol BTC, even if that client was not the longest chain with the most proof-of-work running. Kraken explained they did not want to be in a position to decide which chain gets to keep the BTC moniker. Shapeshift founder Erik Voorhees explained his opinion of the name issue on Twitter stating:   “For the record, myself (personally) and Shapeshift would use the BTC/Bitcoin name for whichever chain unambiguously “won,” over time,” Voorhees detailed.  On March 18 Coinbase founder Brian Armstrong revealed his opinion of the recent contingency plan letter and explained why his company did not participate. “Coinbase didn’t sign this letter because I think the intention behind it is wrong,” Armstrong states. “On the surface, it is a communication about how exchanges would handle the hard fork, and a request to BU for replay attack protection. But my concern was that it was actually a thinly veiled attempt to keep the BTC moniker pegged to Core software. I think a number of people who put their name on it didn’t realize this.” Armstrong agrees that listing forked assets makes sense, but he doesn’t believe the BTC name should automatically go to one development team. “If there is overwhelming support from miners and users around any new version of the software (regardless of who wrote it), then I think that will be called Bitcoin (or BTC),” says Armstrong. The Coinbase founder says the company wishes to remain neutral in the debate. Additionally, one of the exchanges who participated in the letter, Bitfinex released its own listing plan called Chain Split Tokens (CST). Bitfinex customers will be allowed to speculate on the future events of a fork using the CST tokens which include BCC (Bitcoin Core) and BCU (Bitcoin Unlimited). “Users will be able to create CSTs by “splitting” a bitcoin through the Token Manager (located in the order type drop-down menu of the sidebar order ticket),” Bitfinex explains on their website. “Once split, the BTC will be removed from your account for each BCC, and BCU added. Through the same Token Manager, you will be able to reverse this process at any time, trading in equal numbers of BCC and BCU to extract BTC.” The discussion doesn’t seem to be over as far as the bitcoin name and branding is concerned. After the contingency letter, bitcoin proponent Olivier Janssens started a petition to get exchanges to remain neutral and not choose sides. “Designating Bitcoin Core as the default Bitcoin BTC/XBT is premature at best and at this point a highly political decision,” Janssens petition explains. There are quite a few bitcoin supporters who agree with Voorhees, Janssens, and Armstrong’s opinions concerning the longest chain getting the right to the BTC name, as many of them have referred to this quote offered by Satoshi in the bitcoin white paper;   At press time Bitcoin Unlimited has roughly 35 percent of mining support so it still may be a while before any speculated split event takes place. It’s safe to say as of right now no one can predict who will rightfully claim the BTC name and branding, especially with a letter of intent that is disputed by other well-known exchanges.  The discussion will likely continue, and Bitcoin.com will be following these events closely to keep our readers informed every step of the way. What do you think about the contingency plan drafted by some of the exchanges? Do you think that the BTC name should just be designated with Core or do you think the name belongs to the longest running chain? Let us know what you think in the comments below.

2017-03-18T13:58:39-04:00,Major DDoS Attacks Hit Bitcoin.com,David Shares,https://news.bitcoin.com/ddos-attacks-bitcoin-com-uncensored-information/,"Large scale DDoS attacks on Bitcoin.com and its subdomains started a few days ago and have heightened over the past 48 hours, in an apparent attempt at targeting the “big block” side of the ongoing disagreement within the Bitcoin community on how to scale Bitcoin. Also Read: Antpool Points 75% Hashpower at BU, While Exchanges Confirm Listing a Split When Bitcoin.com re-launched the updated site in 2015, it was smack in the middle of the Bitcoin block size debate, which has also been called by many the Bitcoin “civil war”. It’s no secret that during this time, Bitcoin.com has positioned itself as a proponent for on-chain scaling solutions, as envisioned by Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto. Since then, Bitcoin.com has worked with industry experts and leaders in the space to deliver news, uncensored information, and tools to the Bitcoin community. Most recently, Bitcoin.com has opened the Bitcoin.com Mining Pool, which mines using the Bitcoin client Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) and pays 110% block reward and has zero fees. Due to this, Bitcoin.com has been the target of individuals and groups that don’t share the same vision. And this week, the site along with the new mining pool and uncensored forum have all been targeted by attackers in attempts to bring down the site and stop the flow of uncensored information.  Censorship in and of itself has been a huge point of contention within the Bitcoin community, which has had a real and lasting impact to the block size debate in many ways. Due to the heavy DDoS on Bitcoin.com domain and subdomains, the forum and mining pool all have had intermittent up-time. Bitcoin.com has also been working with Cloudflare to help mitigate the issues but some users may still be experiencing problems. It’s also worth noting that the attacks have come at the same time as when the news was released that some Bitcoin exchanges unveiled a hard fork contingency plan. The signed statement has come under a lot of scrutiny because at least two of the exchange signers, Kraken and Shapeshift, said the document they signed was not the same as what they were originally shown. Also missing from the signed statement are several of the biggest exchanges on the market, Coinbase, Gemini, Localbitcoins, among several others. The significance of the timing of these two events can’t be overlooked, as the signed statement clearly has been lauded by the same groups who don’t hold the same values and vision as on-chain scaling proponents in attempt to further smear on-chain scaling. In addition, there have been other subversive attempts at attacking the Bitcoin network in recent times, which has left many scratching their heads just who is behind these sorts of attacks.  We’ve also learned that many BU nodes have had to resort to identifying their nodes as Core because they are being DDoS’d also, as described by Roger Ver in a tweet sent today. What are your thoughts on the recent attacks on the Bitcoin network and on-chain scaling proponents? Let us know in the comments below!

2017-03-18T09:00:39-04:00,Alaska Introduces A Bill to Regulate and License Bitcoin Businesses,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/alaska-bill-license-bitcoin-businesses/,"The State of Alaska has introduced a bill this week defining digital currency, as well as broadening its definition of money transmission to include it. A wide array of business functions would require money transmission licenses, including buying and selling through a third party, transmitting, controlling, and issuing digital currencies. Also read: Bitfinex Will Not Obtain License to Do Business in Washington State Introduced by representatives Zach Fansler and Sam Kito III, Alaska State House Bill No. 180 outlines a large number of amendments to the state’s existing money transmission laws which were enforced on July 1, 2008. Currently, the Alaskan statutes declare that a person wanting to engage in the business of money transmission in any way, including advertising and soliciting for this service, must hold a money transmission license or become an authorized delegate of a person who holds a money transmission license. Digital currency is not currently defined or included in the state’s existing money transmission statutes. This new bill adds a definition for digital currency including bitcoin but refers to them as ‘virtual currency’. According to the bill, virtual currency “shall be broadly construed to cover digital units of exchange” that: 1. Have a centralized repository, which it defines as “a single third-party administrating authority that controls the system, issues the currency, establishes the rules for the currency’s use, maintains a central payment ledger, and has authority to redeem the currency or withdraw the currency from circulation”; 2. Are decentralized, distributive, open-source, math-based, peer-to-peer virtual currency with no central administrating authority and no central monitoring or oversight. The term distributive is further defined to mean validated through distribution among a network of participants who run an algorithm to validate the transaction; 3. May be created or obtained by a ”computing or manufacturing effort”. The bill also updates the existing definition of money transmission with a section pertaining to digital currencies. The term “money transmission” now includes conducting the following types of activity in the state, or involving a resident of the state: Alaska has tried to include ‘virtual currency’ in the definition of ‘money transmission’ before. In House Bill No. 271, introduced last year, the definition of virtual currencies was proposed. However, this bill died in committee. Another bill from Alaskan lawmakers seeking to include virtual currencies was Senate Bill No. 152, introduced last year by the Senate Rules Committee by Request of the Governor. However, this bill did not even get as far as House Bill No. 271 and suffered the same fate in committee. Instead of getting a full money transmission license, Alaska currently offers ‘Limited License Agreement Orders‘ for digital currency businesses. This limited license agreement is for those requesting “approval of a license to provide transmission of virtual currency or does business that incorporates virtual currency in addition to the “traditional” money transmission of fiat currency”, the state’s website explains. Currently, only Coinbase and Circle Internet Financial have this limited license agreement orders and both are listed as having ‘active’ status. If this latest bill is approved, many digital currency businesses will have to obtain an annual money transmission license from Alaska’s Division of Banking and Securities. Recently, Coinbase pulled out of Hawaii because of the state’s strict money transmission license requirements. A couple of days later, Bitfinex pulled out of Washington State because the state requires the company to have a money transmission license as well.

2017-03-18T06:00:52-04:00,Bitcoin Could Face Ethereum-Style Split,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-could-face-ethereum-style-split/,"Loss of public trust and utility, branding issues, a market capitalization crash, and a collapse of trust in the entire crypto-currency space. A contentious Bitcoin hard fork, which represents a change to the Bitcoin protocol requiring all nodes to update, could indeed result in two Bitcoins. Exactly this – a split network – happened in the wake of Ethereum’s choice to hard fork after the $56 million hack of the DAO, a decentralized investor-directed venture capital fund on Ethereum. Also Read: Charlie Lee: “People Don’t Understand Segwit” Not only might perceptions of Bitcoin suffer in the case of a Bitcoin fork, but so too could Bitcoin’s use-case as electronic cash. The issue of scaling Bitcoin has certainly been contentious, and if a fork is initiated with considerable opposition, there could be proponents claiming both versions of Bitcoin are the real one. In a recent Medium post entitled A Fork in the Road, Bitcoin entrepreneur CEO Vinny Lingham highlights how, at least in the short-to-medium term, a network split would impact Bitcoin negatively.  “If a split is portrayed badly in the media and creates confusion, we will possibly go into another 2 years of sideways and down,” wrote Mr. Lingham on March 15. “Do we have that much time again with other competitors on the heels? And let’s be frank, a Hard Fork is not Bitcoin dying. It’s Bitcoin duplicating. Now we have two Bitcoins, both won’t die, maybe one will. Which one is the real Bitcoin? Do not underestimate how many enemies Bitcoin has — a fork will just give them all the ammunition they need to confuse the market”. Bitcoin exchanges have recently unveiled their contingency plans if Bitcoin splits in the wake of a hard fork, which involves them listing the duplicate Bitcoin on their exchanges as an alternative crypto-currency. Before the Ethereum DAO hard fork, many believed that a minority chain in the case of a split would cease to persist. When the hard fork took place, an alternative blockchain to the original Ethereum deployment persisted (by some miners’ choice to stay with that chain), which itself claimed to be the original Ethereum. It called itself “Ethereum Classic” (ETC). Trading of ETC rivaled that of Ethereum (ETH) immediately after the split.  “There are some people who dismiss this problem in the Bitcoin community,” acknowledges the Ethereum Classic project coordinator who only goes by Arvicco. “But they are wrong to do so.”  An important aspect for any digital currency is its scarcity, which acts as an economic incentive for people to use a certain blockchain. If digital currencies risk splits, then their value is undermined. “Creating two networks destroys network effect,” Mr. Lingham suggests.  Wonders Arvicco: “If there is one Bitcoin with a 21 million coins limit today, and two Bitcoins with 42 million coins tomorrow, what prevent us from having 64 Bitcoins with 1.2 billion coins a few years from now?” In another technical twist, if there were such a split as happened in the case of ETH and ETC, all bitcoin holders would have an equal amount of BTC and (theoretical) BUTC post-split. After the Ethereum split, cross-fork trading spiked between it and ETC, leading some to believe the same would happen in the case of a Bitcoin split. As happened on Ethereum and Classic, this could result in cross-chain transaction replay. Transaction replay happens when transactions on one chain are replayed on the other chain, moving both types of coins.  “Imagine that as a result of fork, you got both Bitcoin (Core bitcoins) and BUTC (Bitcoin Unlimited bitcoins) on the same addresses,” explains Arvicco. “Now, you want to pay for something with BTC, but to your surprise the same amount of BUTC is also moving to the seller’s address, even though they were not supposed to.” Another example would be if one wanted to get rid of their BUTC via an over the counter transaction. You get the payment and transfer your BUTC to the buyer. But, the ‘core’ bitcoins from the same address are also sent. This could damage user confidence and diminish the use-case for on-chain transactions.  Whereas Ethereum’s replay problem was mostly dealt with via ‘splitter’ contracts designed to separate ETH from ETC, Bitcoin does not have the scripting capabilities to deploy such contracts. “The only practical way to mitigate the issue would be mixing the legacy coins with post-fork mined coins of different flavors, either BTC or BUTC,” he says.  Developers could introduce incompatible transaction formats, which could preclude a second hard fork – this was the solution used on the ETH/ETC networks. Replay protection could also be introduced simultaneously with the first fork, but this option is not being publicly discussed by developers.  “In practical terms, both networks would be hardly usable for some time after a fork due to replay attacks,” believes Arvicco. “For normal users, it will be problematic to gain the knowledge how to protect themselves from it, so they’ll probably stop using the network altogether.”  Many people are not worried about a split, including Bitcoin developer Peter Todd. “It’s easy to split Bitcoins via nLockTime, as the exact height of the different chains will definitely be different,” says Mr. Todd on Reddit. “I’ve been asked by two or three exchanges to evaluate their plans to do exactly that. IIRC one had invented the technique themselves, and one or two others I suggested it to them.” But, while splitting his BTC from his BUTC via nLockTime might be easy for longtime Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, this might not be so for the common bitcoin user.

2017-03-18T03:00:09-04:00,Bitcoin’s Other Scaling Problem,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-scaling-problem/,"Although many Bitcoiners subscribe to laissez-faire political and economic beliefs of the libertarian variety, some “invisible politics” has reared its ugly head in the ‘Bitcoin Community’ thanks to the digital currency’s scaling issues. The growth of Bitcoin has created a variety of social governance problems that have left many in the ‘Community’ confused.  Also Read: Bitcoin Block Size Growth Plan ‘BIP100’ Gets Update While focus has been largely on scaling Bitcoin at the technical level to make room for increasing transaction demands, the distributed governance of Bitcoin itself has proven difficult.  “There are two types of governance. Governance of a specific software project and governance over consensus rules,” submits Eric Lombrozo, Bitcoin developer and CEO of Ciphrex. “For historical reasons, the two have been conflated in the minds of many people.” Mr. Lombrozo suggests problems could manifest in several ways.  “Governance over a particular software codebase doesn’t require universal agreement over all changes as long as it remains compatible with the existing network,” he says. “It’s only when compatibility is broken that it creates issues that affect everyone in the community.” Further adding questions to Bitcoin’s social issues, when former Bitcoin developer Mike Hearn left Bitcoin for R3CEV, he lamented how Bitcoin had become “completely controlled by just a handful of people.” Critics have claimed Bitcoin needs a “benevolent dictator” to expand and onboard an increasing number of transactions. “Someone, or some group, must decide how to meet users’ requirements,” Reuters reported on the opinions of some in the Bitcoin space.  Cornell Computer Science professor, Dr. Emin Gun Sirer, cites Ethereum, a blockchain smart contract model, and its “benevolent dictator model” as a working example of distributed governance. Vitalik Buterin, Ethereum founder and main programmer, in effect holds controlling decision-making power over that open-source creation community, some say (even though those who disagreee can fork the network). Mr. Buterin has defended this model. “Over the last couple of years it’s become apparent that having a static protocol is just not a viable approach,” Buterin said at a blockchain conference. “Software has to evolve … and there has to be some mechanism for agreeing on how software is going to upgrade.” Mr. Lombrozo points out, however, that Ethereum’s ‘benevolent dictator’ could not stop a split in the Ethereum blockchain, resulting in an duplicate version dubbed ‘Ethereum Classic.’ Gavin Andresen, Bitcoin’s former Chief Scientist, has discussed in YouTube videos how Bitcoin has evolved from a similar model after pseudonymous founder Satoshi Nakamoto’s departure. “If you go back in history, it was really simple. It was whatever Satoshi decided at the beginning. That’s really where we started. We had one source code. We had one [pseudonymous] person who made all the decisions about what should Bitcoin be, how should it evolve, and what should it do,” he said.  Andresen added: “As soon as Satoshi stepped back and threw the project onto my shoulders, one of the first things I did was try to decentralize that. So, if I get hit by a bus, it would be clear that the project would go on. That’s why, at this point, there are five people who have commit access to the Github Bitcoin source tree. And there’s kind of this consensus process for what changes are made to the code — and even what consensus-level, low-level changes to the Bitcoin rules should happen.” In an Internet Policy Review (IPR) article called The invisible politics of Bitcoin: Governance crisis of a decentralised infrastructure, this question is analyzed in depth.  The article paraphrases Yochai Benkler, who said “there are no spaces of perfect freedom from all constraints, only different sets of constraints that one necessarily must choose from.”  Bitcoin might be boasted as a trustless technology, but there’s still a catch.  “It remains subject to the (invisible) politics of a handful of individuals – the programmers who are in charge of developing the technology and, to a large extent, deciding upon its functionalities,” reads the IPR paper. The paper concludes: “The mistake of the Bitcoin community was to believe that, once technical governance had been worked out, the need to rely on government institutions and centralised organisations in order to manage and regulate social interactions would eventually disappear. Politics would progressively give way to new forms of technologically-driven protocols for social coordination– regarded as a more efficient way for individuals to cooperate towards the achievement of a collective goal while preserving their individual autonomy.” In a series of tweets, Mr. Lombrozo has shared his opinion about how Bitcoin might overcome the current gridlock caused by intense disagreement over numerous issues; namely, how to scale bitcoin to meet current transaction demand amid the social scaling problem itself. Many of his tweets have urged people to look beyond intense social media squabbles and start their own Bitcoin-based “cool” projects.  “Decentralized systems require individual effort in discovering sources and filtering out hubris and noise,” he also tweeted. “This is true at the social level as well as the machine level.” What do you think about Bitcoin’s other scaling problem?

2017-03-17T11:11:42-04:00,On-Site Verification May Be Required to Withdraw From Chinese Bitcoin Exchanges,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/on-site-verification-required-withdraw-chinese-bitcoin-exchanges/,"New regulatory guidelines in China may require citizens to verify their identities in person to deposit or withdraw 50,000 yuan when using a Chinese bitcoin trading platform. Also read: An Alliance Forms Under China’s New Bitcoin Regulations The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) recently revealed new requirements for Chinese bitcoin exchanges within the country. Zhou Xuedong, PBOC director of business management, has now detailed an anti-money laundering (AML) prospectus that has been sent to trading platforms for review. Last week Zhou detailed bitcoin trading platforms were not to be called “exchanges” anymore and revealed new AML rules which were sent to bitcoin-based businesses for consideration and recommendations.    This week Zhou has further explained that the central bank wants to standardize the AML framework for virtual commodity trading platforms. Zhou said to a Chinese finance publication that Beijing’s central bank management has emphasized two important aspects of the regulatory prospectus. The fundamental regulatory guidelines include self-regulation and clarity concerning criminal finance prevention and AML control measures. Furthermore, bitcoin trading platforms are required to establish a *sound customer identification system” and practice transaction record preservation. “From the perspective of anti-money laundering — the identity of the account is very critical.” Zhou Xuedong’s translated comments said. “Transaction data synchronization can be sent to the regulatory authorities, as the basis for regulation, from this data authorities can find money laundering information and abnormal transactions.” The paper under review also detailed some particularly noteworthy identity verification rules for customers depositing and withdrawing 50,000 yuan. Chinese customers looking to exchange virtual currency on a platform may need to verify their identities in person for “on-site certification.” PBOC management wants bitcoin trading platforms in the region to establish and improve Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines. The regulatory prospectus also notes bitcoin trading platforms may also utilize “remote video certification” in order to ensure customer identity. Bitcoin.com’s correspondent from China has stated some exchanges have already implemented video verification methods this month. The Chinese finance publication also explains the “presence certification” aspect of the prospectus is a new detail being discussed in the industry, where customers must appear in person at the exchange headquarters. In addition to the new identity verification details, the proposed regulations draft says bitcoin trading platforms should hold senior management responsible for anti-money laundering standards. The PBOC recommends businesses should set up specific departments and positions that are completely focused on anti-money laundering and anti-terrorism financing practices.  The central bank explains that as well as keeping customer records, trading platforms need to maintain a complete and “accurate reproduction” of each customer transaction. Suspicious transactions with specific money laundering behaviors should be reported to the central bank’s management team immediately, the prospectus concludes. What do you think about the PBOC’s recommendations for on-site certification and remote video verification? Do you think this will hinder Chinese bitcoin exchange operations?

2017-03-17T10:00:21-04:00,New Academic Paper Suggests Bitcoin is Resistant to State Control,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/new-academic-paper-suggests-bitcoin-resistant-to-state-control/,"A new academic paper, entitled “Bitcoin: Order without Law in the Digital Age”, explores the “fundamental structure” of Bitcoin. The paper seeks to show “how its decentralized order contrasts with currency regimes”. Highlighting how technology has changed our lives, the paper notes how – with the advent of Bitcoin – even modern currency is not exempt from the steady march of technological progress.  Also Read: Could Bitcoin Affect Emerging Market Monetary Policy?  The paper highlights how bitcoin can “perform the functions of currencies without the traditional law of currency”. The paper also adds that Bitcoin’s global and distributed approach to order without law, as opposed to more spatially-close communities, is novel. “Order without some forms of law is nothing new”, the paper reads. “But previously most forms of order without law depended on relatively close-knit communities”.   “Software is eating away even a function as basic as currency”, concludes the paper. “The digital revolution is evolving from a phenomenon that changed the way we communicate, to an era that is producing innovations that disrupt many of our preconceived notions of law and governance”. The paper, penned by John O. McGinnis and Kyle Roche, does not suggest that bitcoin will replace the US dollar, but that the digital currency could change people’s ways of life. “Bitcoin’s sustained success and growth is proof that it is changing the way individuals and societies exchange value”, the paper argues. Bitcoin is significant for both its own order without currency law and for establishing a platform to help sustain other forms of non-legal order, according to the paper. “Bitcoin represents a potential third currency regime far more resistant to state control, because it is minted in no physical place, operates under encryption, and places a numerical ceiling on the number that can be created”, according to the paper’s abstract. “The trust required is not in any government but in the decentralized order of those who verify Bitcoin transactions”. Bitcoin has advantages over other currencies. “As the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to grow, its non-legal order can help it climb the rungs of stability created by distrust in government”, state the authors. “Bitcoin’s order without currency law will facilitate other forms of order with less law”. The Internet could provide an example of how technology disrupts longstanding institutions. “Like the Internet, Bitcoin is multijurisdictional, and thus one sovereign cannot shut it down”, notes the paper. “Miners can move elsewhere and people can use it elsewhere. Additionally, if Bitcoin proves to be popular and widely used, its advocates will make it difficult for governments to shut down even within personal jurisdictions”.  The paper surmises that, in certain nations, bitcoin could function as competition to fiat currencies. “Central banks have often proven incapable of binding themselves to their redemption promises”, the authors suggest. “Their public law monopoly status gives them immunity from the legal and marketplace sanctions that ordinarily prevent commercial banks from reneging on their commitments”. Additionally, central banks do not need to fear losing customers. Central banks can thus pursue policies that are not in the best interest of the public. Thanks to Bitcoin, citizens who have little trust in their nation’s currency regime are free to consider bitcoin. However, as reported first by Bitcoin.com, hyper-inflationary Venezuela has seen instances of government crackdown on Bitcoin users, lending credence to the claims made in the academic paper. “Bitcoin’s greatest advantage over such state-issued currencies is that it has no political master to serve”, the paper reads. “Bitcoin grants an option to citizens of monetarily oppressive regimes to transact in something other than their state-issued currencies. In fact, we are already seeing Bitcoin gaining market share in transactions in nations such as Cyprus, Argentina, and China, where citizens have reason to doubt the value of the national currency”. Bitcoin, the cyberpunk underground and not the product of legal institutions, is historically unique in this respect. “Until recently, there has been no widespread currency that has been the creation of something other than legal regimes”, according to the authors.

2017-03-17T03:00:43-04:00,Bitcoin Block Size Growth Plan ‘BIP100’ Gets Update,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-block-size-growth-plan-bip100-gets-update/,"Bitcoin developers Tom Harding, Dagur Valberg Johannsson and Jeff Garzik have updated the code to BIP100, a “dynamic maximum block size by miner vote” code proposal which has been in the works for nearly two years. The BIP (short for ‘Bitcoin Improvement Proposal’) could serve as a solution to the ongoing debate over Bitcoin’s block size. Also Read: New Bitcoin Caching Features Could Improve Block Verification A BIP represents a design document meant to introduce new features and information to the Bitcoin community. BIPs represent a central avenue for communicating ideas to the distributed Bitcoin community. The BIP would theoretically allow miners to vote on what the block size limit should be. Mr. Harding believes that miners are actually more invested in Bitcoin than other participants in the peer-to-peer network, and thus better equipped to make decisions. “They invest in hardware that cannot be used for anything else, and they are the one group that will always, every day, be paid in bitcoin and no other currency”, the Bitcoin developer says. “In the aggregate, miners’ stewardship of the protocol secures Bitcoin. This was Satoshi’s design and it has proven correct beyond all expectations”. When he first read BIP100, Mr. Harding did not like it. “I believed in June 2015 that miners might manipulate the block size in ways that were not in the best interest of all users”, he tells Bitcoin.com. “But over the next two years, it was we developers who showed ourselves unable to manage the maximum block size reasonably”. The text for BIP100 puts vivid emphasis on the miners. “Miners directly feel the effects, both positive and negative, of any maximum block size change imposed by their peers”, reads the proposal on Github. “Larger blocks allow more growth in the on-chain ecosystem, while smaller blocks reduce resource requirements network-wide”. According to the Github proposal, miners act as an “efficient proxy” for the Bitcoin system since they earn bitcoins when they create blocks. In order to be deployed, BIP100 needs to garner a considerable amount of support from miners. “A simple deterministic system is specified, whereby a 75% mining supermajority may activate a change to the maximum block size each 2016 blocks”, reads the proposal. “Each change is limited to a 5% increase from the previous block size hard limit, or a decrease of similar magnitude”. Among adopting nodes, there will be no disagreement on the evolution of the maximum block size, according to BIP100. “The system is compatible with emergent consensus, but whereas under that system a miner may choose to accept any size block, a miner following BIP100 observes the 75% supermajority rule, and the 5% change limit rule”, the proposal reads.  “Excessive-block values signaled by emergent consensus blocks are considered in the calculation of the BIP100 block size hard limit, and the BIP100 calculated maximum block size is signaled as an excessive-block value for the benefit of all observers”. BIP100 has been in the making for nearly two years. The proposal was published first by Mr. Garzik, who runs the enterprise blockchain firm Bloq, and who enjoys waxing about the intersection of artificial intelligence and Bitcoin. “Economic actors that wish to see the speed limit [block-size limit] at X or Y – thus dictating the free market – will lobby the Chief Scientist and other ‘core’ developers, individually, in private, in public, with carrots, and with sticks”, writes Mr. Garzik in the draft for BIP 100. “When [the] Bitcoin market cap [grows 10 times] or more, the lobbying [will be] even more intense. Yet there is no single human or commitment on the planet capable of picking a good speed limit”. Does BIP100 offer a tenable solution to Bitcoin’s growth issues? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-03-16T01:59:03-04:00,Bitcoin ETFs Unlikely For The Foreseeable Future,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-etfs-unlikely-foreseeable-future/,"Following its decision to disapprove Bats BZX Exchange’s proposed rule change for Coin ETF, the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) now has two more Bitcoin ETFs to consider; Solidx Bitcoin Trust and Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust. The Commission has until March 30 to make a decision on the former while the latter is many months away. Also read: Examining SEC’s Decision to Reject Bitcoin ETF The SEC’s decision to disapprove the proposed rule change for Coin ETF last Friday was primarily based on the nature of the bitcoin markets. The Commission claimed that Bats BZX Exchange must “have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading” bitcoin or its derivatives and that those markets must be regulated for the rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act. However, since “the Commission believes that the significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated”, the two criteria are not met. The chance that significant markets for bitcoin will be regulated in the near future, if at all, is slim. The wider Bitcoin community has already come to understand this, and expects the Commission to reject the proposed rule change for Solidx Bitcoin Trust, as evident in chat rooms and forums online. Confirming the community’s expectation is former Needham analyst, who is now Head of Research at Blockchain Capital LLC, Spencer Bogart. Citing how the grounds for disapproval of Coin ETF “were related to the dynamics of the underlying bitcoin markets” as opposed to something specific in the ETF filing, he told Bitcoin.com that: Bogart, who is famous for estimating a sub-25 percent chance of Coin ETF being approved by the SEC, now says that the chance for Solidx Bitcoin Trust is “extremely low”, noting that it is “likely to be rejected on the same grounds”. Furthermore, Bogart believes that both NYSE Arca and Solidx Management LLC, which is the sponsor of Solidx Bitcoin Trust, can do “very little” to better the chance of Solidx Bitcoin Trust being approved. Bogart said that he did not think NYSE Arca has a better chance of getting its rule change approved than Bats BZX Exchange, adding that: The SEC noted on Friday that, in the future, “regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop” enough for a Bitcoin ETF to be approved. However, Bogart believes differently, stating that: On February 24, NYSE Arca filed the first amendment to its proposed rule change relating to the listing and trading of shares of Solidx Bitcoin Trust under NYSE Arca Equities Rules 8.201. The comments are due on March 16. When the chance of approval is very low, exchanges sometimes withdraw their proposed rule changes. At press time, NYSE Arca has not done so and the Solidx team did not immediately respond to Bitcoin.com’s request for comment. Do you want the SEC to approve Bitcoin ETFs?

Also Read: Do You Think They’ll Use the US Dollar on Mars? “We were in the process of releasing when [bitcoin developer] Peter Todd took someone else’s exploit and irresponsibly tweeted,” says Bitcoin Unlimited lead developer Andrew Stone. He references a tweet sent March 14 by Mr. Todd, an applied cryptography consultant, who has coded for another Bitcoin node client; Bitcoin Core.  Mr. Stone adds: “We have committed a fix. It took five minutes. We just need to validate some inputs that nodes send us.”  After the BU bug went viral on Bitcoin social media, there was a massive drop in the number of nodes running the Bitcoin Unlimited software. As of 3:45 PM Pacific Standard Time, the number of BU nodes had decreased to levels not seen since autumn last year. Before the bug, BU node deployment had reached an all-time high.   Emil Oldenburg, CTO at the Unlimited-capable pool.Bitcoin.com commented on the events as follows: “It did not affect anything, in fact, we even mined a block during the attack. Our nodes did crash, but they restart very fast.” Bitcoin blockchain monitor site Coin.dance showed a continued strong support for the Bitcoin Unlimited client after fix had been released, with the Unlimited client hitting a new all time high, now responsible for more than 34% of the network’s total mining hashrate. “Remote crashes is a common exploit in software in general,” says Mr. Stone, who doesn’t know how many remote crash CVEs there have been in Bitcoin’s history. What effect this will have long-term on Bitcoin Unlimited, he does not know.  “We will see,” he tells Bitcoin.com. “We are pushing images to miners right now, although many of them are using a variety of masking techniques to protect their infrastructure.”  Bitcoin developers have heretofore generally worked together in large groups on the Bitcoin project. For instance, recent updates to the dominant client ‘Bitcoin Core’ have featured the work of dozens of contributors. But, over time, efforts have seemingly splintered into competing open-source creation communities working around the modern Bitcoin protocol. As has become increasingly apparent in past months, there has been a breakdown in relationships between many developers.  Some also look to sabotage Bitcoin Unlimited, some feeling it is an attempt to hijack the Bitcoin network. “Running my fuzzer on the diffs BU have from Core, and have already some crashes. Hopefully some of them are exploitable,” an internet user using the handle ‘ciphera’ stated on Reddit. “Going to collect as many zero-days to release at the most opportune time possible.” Another user stated: “I will personally exploit any flaw in [Bitcoin Unlimited] and not disclose.” What do you think about the development process?

Also Read: ETF Blues? Check Out These Alternative Exchange Traded Bitcoin-Backed Instruments The Bloomberg reporter delivered this analysis as bitcoin’s overall percentage of the digital currency market had fallen in the wake of a rejected Bitcoin ETF.  However, even as the 125th Bitcoin obituary was being penned, as recorded by a website which tracks such things, bitcoin’s price rebounded quickly after the SEC’s decision on Friday. The digital currency trades at $1,246 at the time of writing.   Google Trends suggests that Bitcoin’s popularity still far outpaces other cryptocurrencies. As seen above, more Google users query bitcoin than the next cryptocurrency by a considerable margin. Despite the decline in its overall percentage of the total cryptocurrency market, bitcoin remains within its historical average of 80-90%. Its nadir, according to Coinmarketcap, took place approximately one year ago when bitcoin fell to below 75% of all cryptocurrency markets combined. The total combined ‘altcoin’ market capitalization broke through to new highs after the SEC’s decision and now sits at about $5 billion overall. According to social media, traders cashed out of bitcoin when the price peaked and found safe harbor in altcoins. For instance, after the SEC’s ETF decision, demand for altcoins spiked and there were price gains across the board on popular trading platforms. “It would be quite hard not to profit from altcoins because everything is pumping”, suggested one cryptocurrency enthusiast, hinting that speculation, not unique use cases, fed the increased demand for bitcoin alternatives.  Bitcoin’s overall percentage of the market remains within its historical range even as Ethereum, the second-largest bitcoin alternative, breaks new price records. The smart contract-based blockchain project reached an all-time high of $24 over the weekend.  “I think investors are looking at [Bitcoin] as a risk management tool”, says Mr. Ganguly. “In China, there are suspicions that people use it to get money out of the country, capital outflows. So, I am not sure that [the SEC’s] decision, about four years in the making, will have a huge effect on people who need the digital currency for the purposes that they do”.  The SEC taking four years to investigate whether or not to approve a rule change to make way for a Bitcoin ETF might even lend legitimacy to the digital currency in the minds of some investors. Writing for Forbes, Laura Shin noted that blockchain analysts Chris Burniske (Ark Invest) and Spencer Bogart (Blockchain Capital) liked the fact that the SEC was thorough and thoughtful in its Bitcoin ETF decision. “They clearly put a lot of thought into investigating the bitcoin markets and took time to explain their reasoning”, Burniske said. Bogart added: “If I’m an institutional trading desk, maybe now I can’t do the ETF, but [the SEC decision-making process] has changed my appetite to trade bitcoin as a whole”.

2017-03-13T14:36:52-04:00,Chinese Central Bank Director: ‘Bitcoin Trading Platforms Cannot Call Themselves Exchanges’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-central-bank-director-bitcoin-trading-platforms-cannot-call-themselves-exchanges/,"On March 13 the PBOC director of business management, Zhou Xuedong explained some of the reasons behind the recent regulatory inspections of bitcoin exchanges and emphasized how trading platforms are to proceed with their activities in the future.    Also read: Norwegian Prosecutors Seek 120 Bitcoins in Court Restitutions The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) has increased its involvement with Chinese bitcoin exchanges significantly over the past few months. The topic of regulating these types of trading platforms has become a regular discussion between politicians and PBOC executives. PBOC director Zhou has told the press, even more details concerning the recent crackdown on bitcoin exchange regulation. Zhou explained there are more regulatory guidelines coming soon, focused on anti-money laundering standards. Currently, the guidelines have been sent to bitcoin exchanges for review and advice towards the new measures. The government continues to encourage blockchain innovation, but using blockchain to produce a “bubble” is something the bank will not support, the PBOC director told a local reporter in a recent interview. “There was a time that the bubble of bitcoin speculation was indeed too much.” said Zhou. During the recent inspections, Zhou stated some platforms had altered bitcoin trading volumes in order to attract more customers. Zhou detailed to the reporter that China is different than other countries when it comes to investing. A large number of Chinese investors are young and are more inclined to take risks trading. Zhou says the risks associated with bitcoin trading are significant and trading platforms must be examined and regulated. “Some economists believe that bitcoin is in a bubble, one that will burst sooner or later,” said Zhou Xuedong’s translated statement. “But technically, bitcoin uses blockchain as its underlying technology. That is a relatively successful application. Some countries have already recognized its legal status and can adopt it as payment tool for purchasing goods, that is to say, they recognize bitcoin’s value. Thus bitcoin may continue to exist. ” Zhou goes into further detail that regulating bitcoin exchanges will consist of many government agencies working together. “Regulation should be implemented in a comprehensive way — Many departments will play their roles and join the regulation,” explains the PBOC director. For instance, Zhou says bitcoin taxation should be regulated by the tax department. One interesting point Zhou emphasized was that bitcoin trading platforms should not be called “bitcoin exchanges.” These types of businesses are just “websites or trading platforms,” the PBOC executive explains stating: In order to become an exchange, businesses must get permission from the securities department or get the state consular to approve that type of request. As far as current bitcoin exchanges are concerned, they can only get this permission “in the future if we qualify them as trading platforms for commodities,” says Zhou. However, the central bank director said there is a possibility of a bitcoin trading platform opting to become an exchange. Zhou adds, “In the long run, they must be included in the local management of commodity trading platforms, under the supervision by the local financial bureau, and implement the main regulatory guidelines and supervision. The PBoC branches, the Securities Regulatory Bureau, Insurance Regulatory Bureau, Revenue Department, the Taxing Department, and others will implement functional supervision.” What do you think about the regulatory crackdown on bitcoin exchanges in China?

According to various reports, Venezuela’s secret police has been coercing Bitcoin miners for bribes or they would otherwise be thrown into jail if they don’t pay the extortion. Also read: Norwegian Prosecutors Seek 120 Bitcoins in Court Restitutions The Venezuelan economy has been suffering from significant hyperinflation and hardship for quite some time. Over the course of the past year, Bitcoin adoption has grown rapidly in Venezuela as some citizens are turning to the decentralized currency and underground mining operations. Electricity is cheap in Venezuela and subsidized by the state, making mining operations more lucrative than working for bolivars. This past November, two brothers from Caracas operating a Bitcoin mining operation were raided by the country’s secret police (Sebin). According to the brothers’ reports, officers ordered them to pay $1,000 for every mining machine they owned. The brothers, who wished to remain anonymous, stated that they had paid the police to keep mining. Nevertheless, miners in Venezuela are being caught more often because the state’s power corporation is finding mining operations consuming 20 times the electricity used in a traditional home. Bitcoin.com has reported on multiple incidents of mining operations being seized by Venezuelan authorities. However, these types of arrests started in March of 2016 as Joel Padrón and José Perales from Valencia were arrested for possession of illegal mining rigs and electricity theft. The miners ran their business stealing electricity within the industrial zone of Valencia, officials from Sebin explained. Sebin also stated that they had seized multiple mining rigs and four laptops from the establishment where Padrón and Perales were arrested. At the time, Daniel Arraez, a consultant for the Venezuelan Bitcoin exchange Surbitcoin, was asked to give a testimony. The accused miners had stated that they had used Surbitcoin’s services to conduct trades. When Arraez went to the police station, he was suddenly detained and thrown in a cell with Padrón and Perales. Arraez details how he was charged with associating with a criminal operation and illegal money transmission. The Surbitcoin consultant said that he spent eight months in prison and is currently preparing for a trial. “We were only the scapegoats of the disastrous situation in the country’s electricity sector”, Arraez explains. Surbitcoin has also had some issues with regional banks this year but is operating once again after a temporary hiatus. However, the company says that its user base has grown from 450 registrants to 85,000 to date. What do you think about the Venezuelan secret police cracking down on miners and exchange employees?

2017-03-13T02:00:10-04:00,ETF Blues? Check These Alternative Exchange-Traded Bitcoin-Backed Instruments,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/etf-blues-check-alternative-exchange-traded-bitcoin-backed-instruments/,"A Bitcoin trading frenzy ensued in the weeks and days leading into the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rejection of the Bitcoin ETF. Many investors might be interested to know that numerous regulated Bitcoin-backed instruments exist across several traditional markets already. Also Read: This Key Bitcoin Indicator is Dropping Like a Rock  A bitcoin-backed ETN (Exchange-Traded Note) was approved back in 2015 in Sweden and a Bitcoin ETI (Exchange-Traded Instrument) was approved last summer in Gibraltar. In what represents the latest approved traditionally traded Bitcoin-backed financial instrument, the Bitcoin ETI enabled individuals to invest in an institutional instrument representative of the digital currency. “BitcoinETI”, an asset-backed ETI tied to Bitcoin, trades under the ticket BTCETI. Gibraltar approved the Bitcoin exchange-traded instrument BitcoinETI for the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, and the instrument was also approved for Germany’s Deutsche Börse. An exchange traded instrument (ETI) is an asset-backed security. Its value, in this case, is related to Bitcoin’s value. ETI’s are used to re-arrange the value of a Special Investment Vehicle (SIV) into an EU Transferable Security. “By listing the ETI on the Gibraltar Stock Exchange, which is an EU regulated market, we are able to bring a high-level of transparency and liquidity to investors,” Ransu Salovaara, CEO of Revoltura said in a press release issued at the time. Revoltura “has plans to introduce and list further digital currency and disruptive technology instruments in the near future.” Available through regulated brokerage firms in Europe, with settlements managed by Clearstream/Euroclear, BitcoinETI functions as any other security in Europe.  “We continue to work with the private sector and our regulator on an appropriate regulatory environment for operators in the digital currency space. The launch of this ETI on our stock exchange demonstrates our ability to be innovative and to deliver speed to market,” said Gibraltar’s minister for financial services and gaming, Albert Isola.  The instrument allows Europe’s asset managers and pension funds to hold Bitcoin through an European Union stock exchange. Gibraltar, an overseas territory of the UK, has long sought to become a EU virtual currency hub. “GSX is an EU regulated market which offers efficient and cost effective solutions for innovative companies and financial products. We look forward to supporting the BitcoinETI in its entry to the public markets” said Nick Cowan, Managing Director of the Gibraltar Stock Exchange. Another publicly traded Bitcoin fund in Europe, XBT Provider, is also designed to track the movements of its underlying asset, bitcoin. The fund offers Bitcoin Tracker One (COINXBT) and Bitcoin Tracker EUR (COINXBE) in the form of an Exchange Traded Note (ETN). ETN’s are unsecured debt securities issued by banks, and they are backed by the credit of the issuer. Holders of the fund have enjoyed impressive gains over its existence.  COINXBT has risen in value from 10 Swedish kronas to 50 Swedish kronas since its introduction. Alan Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Fund (BIT) was launched first as a private fund, but has since ceased issuing shares under this model. It received approval in 2015 from the OTC Markets Group’s OTCQX. BIT represented the first product from Mr. Silbert’s Grayscale Investments, a digital assets management firm. Each share of BIT is worth 1/10th of a Bitcoin.  Instead of applying with the SEC, BIT took another path allowed by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, which disallows it from being traded as an ETF. It has been reported, however, that BIT could be headed for an IPO. Alongside the recently rejected Bitcoin ETF, SolidX has also recently filed to become a fund listed on the New York Stock Exchange and even offer full insurance, but its likely the SEC’s recent ETF rejection could put a damper on such plans.  Would you invest in a bitcoin ETI or ETN, or are you waiting for an ETF?

Court officials are now seeking a substantial restitution of 120 bitcoins alongside millions of Norwegian kroner. Also read: High Tax Slows Bitcoin Development In Norway In the summer of 2015 three men were arrested in the greater Oslo region for operating an online drug operation and an indoor cannabis farm. Norwegian police seized a “considerable amount of narcotics” claiming they were being sold on darknet marketplaces including the original Silk Road. Richard Beck Pederson, a prosecutor in the case, told the press the group of men used bitcoins for transactions to give themselves a level of anonymity. Interestingly the Norwegian prosecutors are seeking 120 bitcoins (US$144,300) and 3.1 million Norwegian kroner ($360,167) for penalties tied to the charges. Beck Pedersen detailed the cannabis dealers were caught selling the bitcoin during the investigation and police have “evidence for the sale in bitcoins.” The case marks the first time a country’s prosecution department has demanded payment in bitcoin. However, prosecutor Beck Pedersen told the local press the act does not mean the state recognizes bitcoin as legal tender. “This is in no way an official Norwegian recognition of the digital currency,” Beck Pedersen told local reporters.          Norwegian investigators spent over two years on the “challenging” probe said the prosecutor. Beck Pedersen also detailed the country’s prosecutors worked with international law enforcement officials during the case as well. Evidence from the case had shown many links to the Silk Road marketplace before it was shut down in 2013, Beck Pedersen explained. Norwegian prosecutors did not disclose why they are seeking some of the penalties in bitcoin. The trial against the three men is expected to begin at some point this year, the prosecutor added. Norway has already stated how the country defines bitcoins under Norwegian law. The Norwegian Tax Administration (NTA) detailed in December of 2013 that the country considers bitcoin an asset and not a form of money. Norwegians at the time were subject to a wealth tax, and when used by merchants bitcoin was also subject to the country’s sales tax regulations. This year the Norwegian Ministry of Finance asked the NTA to consider bitcoin transactions Value-Added-Tax (VAT) exempt. The country’s tax agency subsequently ruled in favor of this decision this past February and Norwegian bitcoin transactions are now VAT exempt.

2017-03-12T12:00:00-04:00,Bitcoin Mining: A Closer Look Under the Hood,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mining-closer-look-hood/,"Bitcoin mining is an integral part of the cryptocurrency’s infrastructure. The operation helps process transactions, creates new bitcoins and submits the validated transactions to the publicized and immutable distributed ledger.  Currently, the network’s hashrate is running at a phenomenal 3,418,031,852 GH/s, strengthening the bitcoin architecture more so each and every day. But many newcomers hearing about bitcoin for the first time wonder, How does bitcoin mining actually work? Also Read: Bitcoin’s Rocket Boosters on Full Throttle as Price Skyrockets to New ATH Bitcoin mining requires the use of a specialized mining computer and software to solve mathematical equations. Miners consist of individuals or organizations running this software who compete with each other to solve these puzzles. When people transact with bitcoin, all of the network’s nodes share information about new transactions in a transaction queue called a mempool. Blocks of transactions are not accepted into a blockchain’s ledger until miners perform a hash function solving the puzzle, which in turn verifies the legitimacy of transactions contained in that specific block. This means miners can try and mine blocks of transactions by hashing (attempting to solve the equation) from a string of numbers and letters. A miner solves the problem with another string of random digits by computing a lucky hash result which is followed by a reward of 12.5 bitcoins and all the transaction fees as well. Hashing requires significant processing time and resources to solve these problems. Deciphering the cryptography in a hash function is not easy and requires brute computational force. All of the miners simultaneously trying to solve these problems create the network’s hashrate. Once a puzzle is solved by the miner the result is called proof-of-work. The mathematical puzzles solved are impossible to predict without overcoming the difficulty of finding a particular hash value. Mining rigs or devices that mine bitcoins continuously try and solve these puzzles over and over until miners get the correct answer. The process not only incentivizes miners monetarily, but also ensures transactions are validated correctly. Every block also hosts the hash of the previous block mined before it. This, in turn, makes sure the system maintains an accurate chain of information which essentially becomes tamper resistant. Let’s Recap: Bitcoin mining can be hard to understand when you’re first introduced to the digital currency. But, once you get a grasp of the concept, it’s not so hard to understand the symbiotic relationship of mining and securing the network.

2017-03-12T06:00:45-04:00,Bitcoin Miner Repays Customer Who Accidentally Paid 2.5 Bitcoins Transaction Fee,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-miner-repays-customer-who-accidentally-paid-2-5-bitcoins-transaction-fee/,"A customer of Bitcoin hardware and service provider Bitmain recently found himself in a “rather embarrassing” predicament. Accidentally having paid a 2.5 bitcoin fee on a transaction mined by Bitmain’s Antpool in Bitcoin block 456363, the user took to social media, desperate to get the funds back.  Also Read: How Much Does it Cost to Run a Full Node? The fee, after having already been dispersed to miners as a mining reward, could have been lost forever. But instead, Bitmain decided to compensate the user for the loss with their own money. In a reply to a service ticket submitted over the issue, Bitmain notified the client of their decision. Dear Customer, We are sorry to hear this… First of all, this mistake caused by himself, and we don’t have responsibility for this. And since now, Antpool has taken PPS+ and PPLNS+ payment method, so his 2.5 bitcoin transaction fee has already paid out to all the miners in Antpool. But thanks for all of your supports and unconditional trust for Antpool and Bitmain, our company has decided to pay his loss. Looking forward to continuing to build your trust and bringing you more added values through our advanced technology and passion. Best Wishes, Hugh Bitmain Regularly on social media, people recount their transaction fee nightmares. They nearly ubiquitously hope they can somehow get their miscalculated or ‘fat-fingered’ transaction fees back. In January, for instance, someone apparently paid 50 bitcoins in transaction fees. The sender might have mixed up the fee and the amount meant to be sent. In general, the average transaction fee is up more than 1,200% in the past two years. Some users believe there could be a solution to overpaid transaction fees. When a Bitcoin user chooses a fee that is too low, for example, a transaction can be outright rejected. Many Bitcoiners suggest that, when a Bitcoiner pays a fee that is too high on a transaction, miners could similarly reject it. As one social media commentator postulates, “Nodes should check that fees don’t exceed the average of the last 10 blocks highest fees. If it’s significantly higher, send a return message back asking for confirmation of the fee.” He adds: “[This has] nothing to do with miners as it is on a node level, and in theory, a mistaken fee shouldn’t enter the network beyond the first node it reaches, which would hold it and require a signed message from the sender to confirm it is correct.”  Many Bitcoin wallets manage transaction fees so their users don’t have to bother.   Bitmain Technologies Limited, based in China, specializes in custom mining chips, miners, and also runs a mining pool. Miners refunding transactions is not completely unheard of, as ASIC miner refunded a more than 200 bitcoin mining fee paid by a customer approximately three years ago.

2017-03-11T20:00:29-04:00,Review: Encyclopedia of Physical Bitcoins and Crypto-Currencies,OP-ED,https://news.bitcoin.com/review-encyclopedia-physical-bitcoins-crypto-currencies/,"At some point in the 7th Century BC, the measured round metallic objects we know and love as “coins” became our archetype for money. Fiat currency – paper tickets purporting to represent actual coins – emerged as its nemesis a millennia later. Our ancestors were not amused as their rulers engaged in the common parlor trick of shaving down and adding cheaper metals to our beloved coins, morphing them into what we appropriately refer to as “debased coins.” Yet long after the emergence of paper notes, coins remain the paradigm of money – whether popping from a block punched by Super Mario or ensconced in name of this website. Also read: Bitcoin Nostalgia: Can Some Bitcoins Be Worth More Than Others? So it should come as no surprise that in the pioneer days of decentralized digital currency, people felt the urge to cast their new money into physical coins. We know little about how the first coins were forged thousands of years ago, but fortunately for us, Elias Ahonen has written the “Encyclopedia of Physical Bitcoins and Crypto-Currencies” to capture this important piece of crypto-history. In his highly detailed and exhaustive catalog of physical cryptocurrencies, Ahonen takes us on a journey from the very first attempts to produce these physical coins, cementing his place as one of the first ‘bitcoin historians.’   Our story begins in late 2010. Understanding our emotional connection to physical coins, programmer and bitcoin acolyte Mike Caldwell first conceived physical bitcoins in his home outside of Salt Lake City, Utah. His idea was to embed tamper proof holograms with private keys into cylindrical metal washers, but he quickly realized that hiding a single hologram into a coin was a more elegant and cost-effective solution. Thus emerged the Casascius coin, which abbreviates the saying “call a spade a spade,” anthologized in Caldwell’s blog “You asked for change, I gave you coins.” These original Casascius coins contained 1 BTC each, and remain coveted artifacts of bitcoin history worth far greater than their nominal bitcoin price. From here, a myriad physical bitcoins emerged, and Ahonen meticulously catalogs the lot of them. Using detailed photos, mintage numbers, and extensive background information, each coin tells its own story. Some come pre-funded, others with an address for the holder to later fund. Some represent events in Bitcoin history such as the collapse of Mt. Gox or the “10,000 btc bitcoin pizza”. Others promote internet memes like the dogecoin from “Shibe Mint.” Collectively, these coins represent the rich material history of early bitcoin and cryptocurrency that Ahonen has meticulously detailed in this book. Physical bitcoins are not just for collectors. Through detailing the history of physical bitcoin and cryptocurrency, Ahonen digs into the effect of social networks within the physical crypto economy; explaining the value of reputation of physical crypto sellers in the marketplace and how that reputation translates to real value. Minters and traders often begin by trading small value coins before they develop the necessary trust for purchasing larger value coins, and coin traders known for their reputation command a higher perch in the marketplace. Moreover, fraudsters and scam artists seeking to offload fake or deceptively billed coins are quickly revealed and reviled in the physical bitcoin community. In this way, the healthy distrust of currency ‘debasers’ – which appears to have subsided in the dollar-system world of the 20th and early 21st century – emerges as a naturally occurring numismatic property. Moreover, a physical bitcoin may be more alienable than digital bitcoin, and the physical bitcoin collector community could become an increasingly important part of the bitcoin ecosystem. With rising KYC barriers to bitcoin exchanges and increased transparency and surveillance of the blockchain by law enforcement and bitcoin compliance firms, transacting in physical bitcoin may be a way of transferring value without alerting the blockchain that a transfer of value has occurred. One Casascius coin can be traded thousands of times without triggering any verifiable transaction on the blockchain. Due to this property, it seems likely that as surveillance and mapping of wallet addresses in the blockchain increases, so too will the value of physical bitcoins relative to their digital peers. For his part, Ahonen acts not only as historian but as evangelist. After getting burned in the digital bitcoin space in Mt. Gox and other boondoggles, Elias found refuge in physical bitcoin buying his first brass Casascius coins in 2013. Today he has amassed a valuable collection, turning his focus to promoting the community through zealously and tirelessly championing his encyclopedia. Last April, after a signed copy was lost en route to Singapore, Ahonen flew to the buyer from Canada to personally sign a copy.  This form of physical couriering is common in the physical bitcoin world, and this is not Ahonen’s first international journey to trade or promote his life’s passion. So whether you are a collector who remembers the early days of bitcoin, want to learn about physical crypto, or are simply a bitcoin enthusiast, this book belongs on your coffee table. To Ahonen, “The concept of digital currency that is based on mathematical principles is simply revolutionary, and will in one way or another eventually reshape the world and society in which we live. These coins are artifacts of that future.” And now, so too is this Encyclopedia. This review was written by Zachary Kelman. What do you think about physical bitcoins?

In China, they’re all inaccessible behind the ‘great firewall’, which refers to internet censorship in the so-called ‘red dragon’. Since the introduction of revamped regulatory measures by most Chinese Bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin trading seems to have, at least in part, shifted to over the counter markets; in particularly, Localbitcoins. Chinese bitcoin exchanges introduced new ‘know your customer’ measures and suspended withdrawals indefinitely last month ahead of new People’s Bank of China (PBoC) guidelines. This has seemingly led to increased volume on over-the-counter markets like Localbitcoins, which facilitates trades in local currency across the globe. Also Read: Bitcoin Transaction Volumes Playing Increased Role Amid China Shakeup  Bitcoin analytics website Coin.dance shows transactions as high as $36 million Chinese yuan over the week ending February 18. That total had exploded to nearly 60 million yuan by last week. The chart, to be sure, also reflects an increasing bitcoin price and an inflating yuan. Nevertheless, increasing bitcoin prices don’t seem to keep investors away from the digital currency. As late as early February 2017, the total trades on the OTC bitcoin website stood below 14,000,000 yuan.  According to the Community Manager for the Finland-based company Localbitcoins, who goes by ‘Max’, transactions on the bitcoin trading platform in China have been done mostly using VPNs. “We’re already technically blocked in China as our site uses, among other things, Google’s re-captcha system,” according to Max on Reddit. “As all Google resources are blocked in China you can’t log in to our site from mainland China unless you use a VPN.” Finding a trustworthy VPN might be difficult in China, which banned all unauthorized VPNs earlier this year. China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology stated ahead of the bans, “China’s internet connection service market…has signs of ­disordered development that ­require urgent regulation and governance.” It added that new regulations will “strengthen cyberspace information security management.” Localbitcoins is available virtually everywhere, and facilitates a variety of trades, including in-person trades between people who want bitcoins, and those who wish to sell them. The vast majority of trades on the site occur with different types of bank-to-bank transfers, but also high risk payments, such as with gift cards. The site has experienced steady growth since it was introduced in 2012, founder Jeremias Kangas recently told Bitcoin.com. “[Localbitcoins] grows at quite steady, predictable pace,” Mr. Kangas said. “In some countries where inflation is high with big differences in currency exchange rates – like Nigeria, Venezuela and others – the rate at which bitcoins are exchanged can be quite different from what the official rates into fiat are. So, bitcoin might be a more and more relevant tool to get the actual value of a specific currency in the future.” Despite ongoing fluctuations in the Chinese bitcoin market, bitcoin prices there have increased this week, sitting at more than 8,000 CNY on all main exchanges."

Following the announcement, the price per bitcoin dropped to a low of US$1,020. The price has since rebounded to the $1,180 mark, at the time of writing. Also read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin markets took a sharp dive after the SEC announcement, losing 15 percent of its price value in a matter of minutes. During the day the price had climbed to a new all-time high for a short period as people waited for the decision from the U.S. regulatory agency. However, as soon as the decision was made the decline started creating significant volatility and slow exchanges. The bitcoin exchange Coinbase suffered from an outage during the event but camed back online shortly after the initial price drop. Most of the bitcoin community across forums and social media seemed to brush the news off quickly. Some even welcomed the rejection with open arms saying they didn’t want the ETF approved. Many bitcoin proponents said the price was expected to be volatile following the announcement either way. “The markets are digesting the information at the moment – we expect continued volatility and high volume,” explains the cryptocurrency data website Crypto Compare founder Charles Hayter, detailing his opinion of the situation; “The SEC does not like Bitcoin being unchained from all regulation, and this move is, in essence, a form of consumer protection,” Hayter explained. Petar Zivkovski, Chief operating officer of the bitcoin trading platform Whaleclub spoke with Bitcoin.com and gave us Whaleclub’s opinion of bitcoin markets going forward. “We expect a substantial decrease in volatility going forward, both in selling and buying BTC. Most of the run upwards from the $750 level was powered by rumors and speculation surrounding the Coin ETF,” Zivkovski told Bitcoin.com. The price seems to have consolidated from the initial shock as markets have tamed and bitcoin’s price rejuvenates. The SEC staff can still approve a bitcoin ETF after more regulation and oversight is considered. Bitcoin proponents who supported the ETF still seem optimistic that a digital currency fund could come to fruition in the future, and some could care less.

2017-03-11T10:00:40-04:00,Examining SECâs Decision to Reject Bitcoin ETF,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/examining-secs-decision-first-bitcoin-etf/,"On Friday, Bitcoin.com reported on the ruling by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) rejecting Bats BZX Exchange’s proposed rule change to list and trade Coin ETF. In this article, we examine the reasoning behind the SECâs decision and the Bitcoin communityâs reactions. Also read: SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETFÂ  The SEC explained how the proposed rule change was disapproved because the proposal was not consistent with âSection 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act, which requires, among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interestâ. In order to be consistent with the Exchange Act, the SEC explained that: However, Friday’s Order states that: Since bitcoin markets are largely unregulated, the SEC concludes that Bats BZX Exchange does not have and would not be able to have the type of surveillance-sharing agreement which all other SEC-approved commodity-trust ETPs (exchange-traded-products) have. The Commission claims that these agreements help address âconcerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices in this marketâ. Without them, the proposal would not be consistent with Section 6(b)(5) of the Exchange Act. According to the Commission, 59 comment letters were received on this proposed rule change as of March 8. The 38-page Order dedicates 15 pagesÂ to discussions of comments received by the SEC, grouped into comments regarding; the worldwide market for bitcoin, the Gemini exchange, and the derivatives markets for bitcoin. One commenter, Mark T. Williams, otherwise known as âProfessor Bitcornâ inÂ the Bitcoin community, is a member of the Boston University faculty specializing in banking, capital markets and commodity trading risk. The professor is infamous for publicly predicting in late 2013 that Bitcoin will fail and crash to below $10 by June 2014. He has since doubled-down on his claim and stands by his opinion today that the Bitcoin âbubbleâ will indeed deflate eventually, and insists that he will be vindicated. For some reason, the Commission cited Williams eight times inÂ its ruling, so his comments stood out among others. He told the SEC that “There are several fundamental flaws that make Bitcoin a dangerous asset class to force into an ETF structure”. He also tried to convince theÂ Commission to disapprove the ETF, citing the problems of âshallow trade volume, extreme hoarding, low liquidity, hyper price volatility, a global web of unregulated bucket shop exchanges, high bankruptcy risk and oversized exposure to trading in countries where there is no regulatory oversight, such as Chinaâ. However, the Commission wrote that: âUltimately, however, comments on these topics do not bear on the basis for the Commissionâs decision to disapprove the proposalâ. The Bitcoin community went wild on social media after the decision. The stated reasons for disapproving the proposed rule change for Coin ETF did not resonate well with the community. Not all were disappointed by the outcome, however. Famous speaker Andreas Antonopoulos tweeted: âThe ETF was denied because bitcoin can’t be regulated, can’t be surveilled. Feature, not bugâ. Another of his tweets says:  Bitgo CTO Ben Davenport also took to Twitter with his interpretation of the event. “SEC: bitcoin must be traded on regulated markets to be traded on regulated markets”, he tweeted. Senior Advisor at MIT Media Lab, Michael Casey, tweeted: âSEC rejection of #Bitcoin ETF means the space remains interesting. For now, BTC stays in the zone of disobedience. Where innovation happensâ. While the SEC rejected the proposed rule change for Coin ETF, it is not all hopeless for other Bitcoin ETFs. The Commission wrote: The next Bitcoin ETF up for consideration by the Commission is Solidx Bitcoin Trust whose deadline is March 30. The third one in line is Barry Silbertâs Bitcoin Investment Trust whose deadline is sometime in October.

2017-03-11T00:00:24-04:00,Chinese Congresswoman: ‘PBOC Should be Responsible for Bitcoin AML’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-congresswoman-pboc-responsible-bitcoin-aml/,"More information on the developments in China have been coming out recently, concerning the new regulations of Chinese bitcoin exchanges. On March 9th, Wu Xiaolin, the former deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) and congresswoman for the National People’s Congress, told a local reporter the central bank should be responsible for these types of bitcoin trading platforms. Also read: A Better Scaling Solution Than Segwit? Sergio Says So According to Wu Xiaolin, the PBOC should be in charge of regulating bitcoin exchanges because the businesses involve certain aspects of anti-money laundering (AML), foreign currency management, and payment settlement. Wu explains the recent inspections were needed, so bitcoin is not a tool used for money laundering purposes. The congresswoman also states she hopes the bitcoin exchanges within the country are compliant with the new regulatory policies. However, she expressed bitcoin exchanges have so far been very cooperative and have carried out self-examinations.  “Bitcoin is a relatively successful application of blockchain technology,” details the translated commentary from congresswoman Wu Xiaolin. “Now different governments and regulators have different options on bitcoin. In China, we defined it as a digital asset. There are other countries considering it as a decentralized currency without legal compensation characteristics.” Wu has spoken about bitcoin many times in the past once stating the digital currency should be regulated but not banned. Moreover, the congresswoman has said the existence of bitcoin and government issued virtual currencies can coexist. Wu and some of her colleagues seem to have little issues with bitcoin as long as it is monitored.     Meanwhile, the PBOC Governor Zhou Xiaochuan has also made recent statements concerning China’s vision towards financial technology. “The central bank highly encourages the development of financial technology,” explains Xiaochuan. “Digital currency, blockchain, and other technologies will have an unpredictable impact. In the development process, the problems encountered needs to be regulated.” Alongside the recent PBOC inspections, the U.S. State Department released a report written by the International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INLEA) concerning China and many other countries’ financial regulation enforcement strategies. The INLEA report gives a very detailed overview of the recent PBOC regulatory crackdown on the Chinese financial sector. The statements made seems to imply the U.S. government hopes China continues to make improvements to its AML legal and regulatory framework towards underground financial systems and digital currencies. “China should cooperate with international law enforcement to investigate how indigenous Chinese underground financial systems, virtual currencies, and trade-based value transfer are used for illicit outbound transfers, and to receive inbound remittances and criminal proceeds,” the INLEA report concludes. Chinese regulators, politicians, and PBOC executives are indeed applying great attention to financial regulation enforcement with bitcoin businesses and many other types of monetary exchange operations.

2017-03-10T16:04:41-04:00,SEC Rejects Rule Change for Bitcoin ETF,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/sec-rejects-rule-change-for-bitcoin-etf/,"The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) today issued an order disapproving the proposed rule change to list and trade Coin ETF on the Bats BZX Exchange. This is the first Bitcoin ETF which the SEC has ruled on. Two other Bitcoin ETFs are also being considered by the Commission. Also read: Examining SEC’s Decision to Reject Bitcoin ETF The SEC has just published an “Order Disapproving a Proposed Rule Change, as Modified by Amendments No. 1 and 2, to BZX Rule 14.11(e)(4), Commodity-Based Trust Shares” to list and trade the Coin ETF. Bats BZX Exchange filed the proposed rule change with the Commission on June 30, 2016, which was subsequently published in the Federal Register on July 14. Almost 240 days later and 59 comments received, the SEC finally made a decision. In its order, after recapping the filing history, the Commission wrote: Read about the reasons for the SEC’s rejection here. Bitcoin’s price has been on a wild ride today as the market anticipates the ETF decision. While many in the Bitcoin community were hopeful of a positive outcome, analysts had already expected the approval of a Bitcoin ETF to be unlikely. Needham & Company, for example, predicted a less than 25 percent chance of it happening. Last month, the firm published an in-depth analysis on Bitcoin ETFs which also discussed the effects on bitcoin’s price should the SEC reject the proposed rule change. Author Spencer Bogart, who previously expected a “highly limited” downside back in January, revised his view and wrote that: “we think downside risks is greater than it was only a few weeks ago”. His stated reasons were that “there’s been a significant run-up in price, the premium on GBTC has fallen substantially, the ETF has seen a significant increase in media attention, and some segments of the market appear to be speculating in favor of approval”. Despite downside risks, Bogart concludes that: This is the first time the SEC has made a decision on a proposed rule change to list and trade a Bitcoin ETF. There are two other proposed rule changes, both filed by NYSE Arca, for two different bitcoin ETFs being considered by the Commission this year; Solidx Bitcoin Trust and Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust.

2017-03-10T12:25:33-04:00,Bitcoin Price on a Wild Ride as Market Anticipates ETF Decision,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-wild-ride-market-etf-decision/,"The Bitcoin market has been going crazy today in anticipation for the upcoming exchange traded fund (ETF) decision expected to be announced at any moment. During the early morning hours of February 10, the price per bitcoin hit an all-time high of US$1350. Following the brief spike the price has been volatile and dipped to $1250, but bitcoin’s value continues to break resistance attempting to reach the $1300 range again. Also read: Cheapair.com Bitcoin Sales Soar 74% Over the Last 6 Months Many bitcoin supporters believe the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) will announce the ETF decision today. SEC very well could announce whether it approves the bitcoin ETF or not during its live webcast of the agency’s “Evidence Summit.” The market seems to be reflecting a positive outcome as many hope it will be a significant endorsement towards bitcoin as an asset class.  Currently, at press time, the price per bitcoin has been moving up and down from $1230-1275. Traders seem to be playing the scalps and intra-range price movements while waiting for the official SEC announcement. Throughout March 8-9 bitcoin’s price dropped and consolidated a formation at the $1150 mark looking as though a breakout would take place. Technical indicators pointed in the direction of a downward position but that all changed during the morning of March 10. After the announcement it’s a safe bet there will be significant market movements with bitcoin’s price, but it’s anyone’s guess which way it’ll go. While everyone awaits the ETF decision, there’s been some other announcements in the meantime. On March 9 the Mt Gox bankruptcy trustee Nobuaki Kobayashi updated the public concerning the upcoming claim distribution process. It seems the U.S. government will be releasing 50 percent of the funds they seized from a Mt Gox affiliate. The U.S. will release $2.57 million in funds as long as the affiliate agrees to withdraw its claim for the remainder. The trustee’s notice details the $5.14 million in funds were seized from the exchange’s Mutum Sigillum LLC subsidiary for illegal money transmission. Kobayashi has agreed to the settlement agreement, but a hearing will take place on April 24, 2017. The recent announcements from the Mt Gox investigation show customers may see some money in the near future. In other news, the bitcoin payment company Abra has launched direct support for BTC. Abra’s system operates with bitcoin transactions under the hood, but now the company is bringing the decentralized currency directly to the application interface. Now users can buy, hold and send bitcoin using the Abra platform. Furthermore, U.S. and Philippines residents can buy bitcoin with their bank account without a fee. The company says it’s pleased to add bitcoin amongst it 50 plus currencies utilized on the platform. A vast majority of bitcoiners will likely have their eyes peeled in regards to the ETF decision. If the ETF is approved many believe it could help the U.S. become more of an innovative technology leader. The approval could lead to more avenues for mainstream investment into the digital currency economy and could also spark more interest from other nation states. If the ETF is not approved the market will likely react, but it doesn’t mean it’s an end all decision for bitcoin exchange-traded funds. The creators of these ETFs will just have to address the issues and concerns given by the SEC and resubmit for approval again.

The travel website also offers hotel and car rental deals. Since its inception in 1989, the site reported having sold approximately 3 million airline tickets. According to Cheapair.com CEO Jeff Klee, customers have been buying airfare using bitcoin at a record rate for the company. He attributed the rise in sales to the rise in bitcoin’s price and the speculation in the market that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) may approve the first Bitcoin ETF. “The volatility of the currency has affected sales in the past in both directions, as sales have dipped when bitcoin prices dropped, and spiked as prices increased”, he noted. Klee further revealed that: Cheapair.com started accepting bitcoin payments for air tickets in November 2013, when bitcoin’s price was around the $200-300 range. By February 2014, it began accepting the digital currency for hotel reservations. “Thanks to Coinbase’s convenient and simple to use two-click payment process, accepting bitcoin has connected Cheapair.com with thousands of new travelers who live and breathe the digital currency”, the company announced at the time. Since then, the company claims to have processed more than $15 million in bitcoin payments for flights and hotels. “Accepting bitcoin has been great for us,” Klee said and noted in the announcement that: Meanwhile, rival online travel site Expedia uses Coinbase to only accept bitcoin payments for hotel bookings, while startup BTCTrip which calls itself “the travel agency for the cryptocurrency community” accepts bitcoin for flights and hotels through Bitpay.

2017-03-10T03:30:42-04:00,"Bitpay Confident in Bitcoin, But Raises Its Minimum Transaction Size",Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpay-confident-in-bitcoin-but-raises-its-minimum-transaction-size/,"The Bitcoin network is currently experiencing a period of rapid growth, which has caused scaling issues for the technology and social fissures in the online creation community. Bitpay, the juggernaut global bitcoin payment service provider, threw its support behind Bitcoin on Tuesday in a post by CEO Stephen Pair. The Atlanta-based company then raised its minimum transaction size limit on Wednesday, citing Bitcoin’s rising transaction fees. Also Read: Did Julian Assange use the Bitcoin Blockchain to Prove He is Alive? On Wednesday, Mr. Pair summarized Bitpay’s view of the present day for Bitcoin.  “Markets and economics will eventually overwhelm any ideological stance community members hold,” wrote the Bitpay CEO in a Medium post. “Miners may be compelled to increase the block size limit leading to a disorderly hard fork experiment. On the other hand, a user revolt might lead to a minority fork with equally disorderly results. Both sides of the debate seem to believe that Bitcoin will be destroyed if the other side gets their way. We are somewhat less fatalistic — we believe a variety of scaling solutions will materialize, and Bitcoin will enjoy continued success.” In a blog post the following day, Bitpay announced that it is seeing all-time highs in bitcoin transactions processed via their service, before making a potentially telling announcement.  “[Effective tomorrow] we’re raising the Bitpay minimum invoice amount from $0.04 to $1,” the company wrote on Wednesday. The rising costs of miner fees have hurt the pockets of some Bitcoin companies. Sources from more than one Bitcoin-related industry told Bitcoin.com they are experiencing increasing costs, with one reporting .50 cent fees on transactions as low as $1. Many experts say the network no longer lends itself to smaller payments. Bitpay seems to confirm this. “We’re responding to the increasing cost of miner fees by raising the minimum for Bitpay invoice creation to $1.00, effective [March 9],” Bitpay stated. “This change will protect consumers from creating un-economical transactions and remove our own risk for processing unprofitable transactions.” Bitpay will allow merchants to experiment with “low-value invoices” under $1.00 on its testnet, which is based on Bitcoin’s testnet.  Mr. Pair seemingly primed the public for the announcement through his Medium account, in which he evoked Bitcoin’s “surging popularity” and “congestion” on the blockchain. He shared a chart about Bitpay’s rising miner fees.  “The data does not reflect miner fees paid by people paying a Bitpay invoice or fees paid by users paying from a Copay or Bitpay wallet,” Mr. Pair writes. “These are the fees Bitpay has paid to transfer its own bitcoin. The fees are normalized to USD to factor out the rising price of Bitcoin.” According to the data, Bitpay’s monthly miner fee costs have increased 35-fold. “If we factor out our transaction growth of nearly 3x, it is still nearly a 12-fold increase,” tempers the CEO. “The fees aren’t just rising, they’re rising exponentially.”  Mr. Pair suggests that eventually an “equilibrium” will be struck and the true cost of a Bitcoin transaction discovered. He notes the value of the average transaction through Bitpay is rising. “Many of the businesses we’ve signed up over the years have started using BitPay for B2B supply chain payments,” Mr. Pair writes. “And we have more and more enterprises signing up every day that need to make very large international plant and equipment related payments. For these customers, miner fees of a few dollars are irrelevant.” He predicts that high value transactions will crowd out smaller bitcoin payments, which will then move ‘off-chain’, a term in the Bitcoin community denoting various solutions to the Bitcoin micro-transaction problem. Despite Bitcoin’s growing pains, Bitpay remains confident in the technology over ‘altcoins’; anyone of the thousands of ‘copycat’ crypto-currencies that have cropped up in recent years. “…A market is forming between on-chain, mining-secured payments and off-chain, more conventionally secured payments,” Mr. Pair surmises. “An off-chain payment could take the form of an alt-coin transaction, but the reduced security, increased volatility, and lack of liquidity of an alt-coin is going to make that a less attractive option.” He concludes: “As off-chain transactions in one form or another are increasingly adopted, market share growth will start to diminish for miners. With their considerable investments at stake, they will be under pressure to increase transaction throughput to compete with off-chain payment solutions. We estimate that Bitcoin needs to achieve an approximate 100 fold increase in throughput just to be viable as a savings and settlement medium (aka digital gold). Market forces will push in that direction, but we need seamlessly inter-operable off-chain solutions to relieve some of the pressure while work is done to safely increase on-chain throughput.” What do you think about Bitpay’s position and actions?

Also Read: Mainstream Media Columnist Says SEC Should Reject Bitcoin ETF RUSI consultant David Carlisle said that there is a lot of attention given to the possibility of bitcoin being used as a terrorist financing tool but “overreaction could stifle an important new financial technology”. He noted that there are very few instances where cryptocurrencies have been used for terrorism. However, the prospect of utilizing virtual currencies for terrorist activity has produced a significant response from many governments. Believing the response to be sensationalized, he states that: The RUSI contributor says that it is not yet clear whether cryptocurrencies will be used in terrorist financing. At the moment, Carlisle explains that terrorists already have a vast array of existing “financing streams, which show little sign of drying up”. Additionally, another RUSI report reveals that lone actors and small cell terrorists are using financial services such as student loans, payday loans, welfare benefits, and cash. Furthermore, law enforcement has a difficult time investigating terrorists using traditional mediums of exchange. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin, for example, are not entirely anonymous, as most blockchains are openly available to the public, explains Carlisle. “Cryptocurrencies are also not necessarily impenetrable fortresses of secrecy — With bitcoin, which is by far the most widely used cryptocurrency and relies on a public ledger — the blockchain — to record transactions, law enforcement agencies have a number of methods for uncovering illicit activity”, Carlisle’s report details. Carlisle believes that cryptocurrencies are an innovative force and “overreaction and panic in this early stage in cryptocurrencies’ history would be misguided”. The report explains that Bitcoin could reduce the costs typically found at traditional payment providers and offer a better form of financial inclusion to citizens worldwide. The RUSI report states: “Virtual currencies, therefore, offer governments a test case in harnessing the promise of technological innovation while also managing financial crime risks that are still only taking shape”. “Countries should pursue a sensible approach — Countries should take the time to monitor and assess the effectiveness of new regulation before rushing into further action”, Carlisle concludes in his paper.

Zhou Xuedong, Director of the Bank’s Department of Business Management, which carried out inspections of bitcoin exchanges, outlined some new rules which exchanges must follow. Also read: Reserve Bank of India Predicting the Future of Bitcoin  Zhou, who is also a deputy to the NPC (National People’s Congress), the national §legislature of the People’s Republic of China, reportedly revealed the short and long term plans that the PBOC has for bitcoin exchanges. The Chinese media outlet Sina reported him saying that in the short term, clearly defined rules for bitcoin exchanges are necessary. They must establish risk prevention and mitigation policies, and they must be kept under strict supervision, he continued, adding that: Among the numerous rules Zhou proposed was a list of prohibited activities imposed on bitcoin exchanges. According to Caixin, this list includes: 1. Offering leverage and margin trades.
2. Producing fake volume and manipulating the market using zero fees.
3. Violating AML laws.
4. Violating regulations on foreign currency management and cross-border capital transfer with bitcoin.
5. Replacing fiat by using bitcoin to purchase goods.
6. Tax Evasion.
7. Engaging in false advertising or participating in Ponzi schemes.
8. Providing financial services without a permit, including credit, securities, and futures trading. There will be penalties and fines for any bitcoin exchanges found to be in violation of these rules, Zhou warned, adding that they can be suspended or forced to withdraw from the market. Serious violators can even be forced to shut down their businesses. Caixin also reported Zhou saying that bitcoin is “a special digital asset that is difficult to be controlled” given its characteristics such as anonymity, being globally distributed and having no physical entity. He said that the PBOC will research the properties of bitcoin, explore management policies for the exchanges at the national level, and also consider licensing a number of qualified exchanges. The NPC Deputy then proposed a “calm and rational” approach when looking at bitcoin, noting that: He was also asked by a Caixin reporter whether the inspections of bitcoin exchanges could be extended upstream to suppliers or downstream to customers. Zhou replied: “From the angle of AML, it is mostly the downstream that should be considered, including withdrawing bitcoin and withdrawing fiat currency. This is a critical step“. Also, Zhou listed other aspects for exchanges to consider, including account identification, funding sources, capital flows, and abnormal transactions. He sees beneficial uses for blockchain technology, believing that it can be used for reference and for regulating the flow of bitcoin and fiat currency. He suggested how data from exchanges to regulators can be synchronized as the basis for regulation. “And with this data, some of the money laundering information and abnormal transactions can be identified”, Zhou told Caixin.

Related: Washington State Liquor & Cannabis Board OK With Bitcoin for Pot “Listening to twenty politicians debate an esoteric issue is fantastically entertaining,” Jeremy Kauffman, who served as New Hampshire’s governor-appointed advisor for the virtual currency bill, tells Bitcoin.com. “At one point in committee, there was a fifteen-minute debate as to whether or not a previous bill [pertaining to virtual currency] would have regulated Beanie Baby trading, and whether or not such trading should be regulated even if it did.” A significant portion of discussion time in committee, and on the floor, centered around the Silk Road and ransomware, according to Mr. Kauffman.  “There is tremendous conflation among politicians between the bad things that happen with bitcoin and the technology itself,” he said. “New Hampshire has the highest per-capita bitcoin usage and the longest-running bitcoin meetup. Due to the Free State Project, a lot of early bitcoiners were residents here.”  According to Google Trends, the state ranks sixth in terms of ‘Bitcoin’ search volume for the U.S., behind states like California, Nevada, Washington, New York and Utah.  Representative Keith Ammon, the bill’s sponsor, and long-time Bitcoin enthusiast spoke in favor of the bill on the floor. Representative Barbara Biggie co-sponsored the bill. Representative John Hunt, who helped get the bill out of committee, also defended the bill on the floor by suggesting that regulating the currency would be akin to regulating Beanie Babies. 
 Bitcoin regulation in other states has led to an exodus of digital currency companies. Just recently Hawaii virtual currency regulations led Coinbase to leave the island state. “We understand the Hawaii [Department of Financial Services] has further determined that licensees who hold virtual currency on behalf of customers must maintain redundant fiat currency reserves in an amount equal to the aggregate face value of all digital currency funds held on behalf of customers,” Coinbase stated. A French man is suing the New York Division of Financial Services over the ‘Bitlicense,’ claiming there has yet to be enough research on the topic of digital currency for regulations to be implemented.  “There are significant and irreconcilable factual differences between the arguments presented by Plaintiff-Petitioner and by Defendants-Respondents which can only be resolved through limited discovery,” the ‘Bitlicense’ lawsuit’s most recent filing reads. “Those fundamental factual differences and disputes involve whether bitcoin is a ‘financial product’ or service which impacts whether Defendants-Respondents had the authority to regulate bitcoin, and whether Defendants-Respondents acted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion when they designed the Regulation.” Mr. Kauffman has some advice for those looking to engage politicians in virtual currency discussions. “My top advice for advocating for the passage of similar bills is to talk about how many smart people are betting a lot of money on this being ‘Web 3.0’ or similar,” Kauffman imparts. “Talk about how the states that encourage this kind of innovation will get the jobs. Reference New York as an example of doing it wrong, and all the businesses that fled and closed.” Kauffman wonders: Is New Hampshire the best place to run a cryptocurrency business?  “It already has the highest per-capita bitcoin usage,” he writes on the LBRY blog. “And very soon it is likely to have the most favorable regulatory climate.” You can see some of the discussion about virtual currency regulation in New Hampshire in the video below:  What do you think of New Hampshire’s House Bill?

Essentially, the author does believe in ‘blockchain technology’, but bitcoin is primarily used for “money laundering, ransomware, tax evasion and other criminal activities” according to Angel. The article states that if SEC approves these bitcoin-backed ETFs it will only further bolster these types of illicit activities. “Blockchain has many legitimate applications, but Bitcoin 1.0 is not one of them,” explains the Hill opinion piece. “Bitcoin is a payment system ideally suited to the black market. The anonymity of bitcoin transactions makes it ideal for drug-running, terrorist funding and human trafficking. Bitcoin is the “coin of the realm” in the dark web.” The author details the last time he discussed bitcoin with others he asked if anyone had used the digital currency before. He explains the last time he talked about bitcoin and asked this question one person disclosed they were hacked by ransomware. In his opinion, the primary use for bitcoin is only for criminal activity, and he believes no one has explained this detail to the SEC agency. “For this reason alone the SEC should reject them based on inadequate disclosure,” the author concludes. Following the article, the digital currency and blockchain legislative advocacy group Coin Center’s Jerry Brito blasted back at the Hill author for being very “misguided.” Brito explains the author just spouts off personal opinions and doesn’t cite substantial evidence proving them. “The advent of the Internet led to rampant piracy, the proliferation of porn and illegal gambling, easier criminal communications, anonymous harassment, as well as new kinds of confidence scams,” Brito explains. “Could you imagine if the government in the early 1990s took advice like that of Mr. Angel? Advice that amounts to, ‘Please look only at the potential costs of this technology and ignore all the potential benefits because they’re too unproven and uncertain.’ We would be much, much poorer today.”  Time and time again mainstream media has tried to portray bitcoin in a negative light. Moreover, the Hill author forgets to mention that many other payment rails like cash and credit cards fund quite a bit of illegal operations. It is true that bitcoin has been used in ransomware and other illicit activities. Just as it is true malicious malware also uses Paypal and pre-paid cards. Ransomware has been around since 1989, well before bitcoin. The rest of the illegal black market deeds mentioned in the Hill article are also heavily funded by fiat reserves, credit cards, mainstream payment providers, as well as by gold and diamonds.  The small twenty billion dollar bitcoin economy pales in comparison to the criminal activities financed by traditional mainstream mediums of exchange, even ones that have ETFs.

2017-03-09T01:00:13-04:00,Bitcoin Price Consolidates on ETF News,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-consolidates-on-etf-news/,"After falling $100 on Tuesday morning, bitcoin’s price continued its decline on Wednesday. The price, which peaked at $1,285 on Monday according to the exchange Bitstamp, dropped 1.5 percent the next morning. Within thirty minutes of this decrease, the digital currency had fallen to $1,160. The price then climbed to $1,229 before taking another downturn. Related: Don’t Miss the Fine Print on that Bitcoin ETF There are numerous dynamics at play in the bitcoin market. The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) recently stated that the digital currency needs to be strictly regulated. Exchanges there announced last month that they would cease withdrawals until March, only to extend the wait further.  In the past year, according to Google Trends data, search interest for the term ‘buy bitcoin’ has steadily increased. In early February, it began a steep climb indicative of a future increase in buying interest.  The forthcoming SEC announcement about whether or not a Bitcoin ETF would be allowed could have also played a role in recent price movements. Some have suggested that the declines resulted from insider trading and speculators betting that the Bitcoin ETF would not be approved. According to people “familiar with the matter”, and anonymous source Bitcoin.com has been in contact with, the ETF decision could come as early as Friday, and perhaps even earlier. Others say the decision might arrive on Monday. The hedge fund Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI), in a letter to subscribers, noted this week that it believes there is only a 25% chance the ETF will be approved. Despite the recent lull in price and uncertainty over the Bitcoin ETF, many analysts remain optimistic about the future of the price of bitcoin. Increased regulation from Chinese authorities, demonetization in India, recently passed legislation in Japan, as well as the general decline of the value of fiat currency, are all seen as impetuses to bitcoin’s price rise. Analysts share a wide range of future price predictions. “In terms of price this year, I think [bitcoin] will go up to $3,000. As it becomes more pervasive and more generally accepted, I think you’ll see rapid growth in adoption”, Adam Davies, a consultant at Altus Consulting, told CNBC in an interview on Tuesday. “People are unsure about what is going on in the world, and digital currencies unlike the U.K. pound sterling have been hit badly because of Brexit, so people are looking to divest into bitcoin. There is a definitely upward trend. So the drivers will be hedging against currency fluctuations and insecurity in the markets”. Clif High, an analyst who some have called a modern-day Nostradamus, predicted that the recent price decrease is no more than a minute lull. “Bitcoin is gonna be $13,008 by February of next year”, predicts Mr. High. “Bitcoin is simply escalating. And bitcoin doesn’t explode [in price] until 2019”. In a study of the effects of Bitcoin halvings on the bitcoin price, Bitcoin.com found that it would not be unreasonable to anticipate a more-than-$10,000 price per bitcoin in the period of time following the 2016 ‘Bitcoin halving’, in which Bitcoin miner rewards were reduced by one-half. Bitcoin’s price increased 120 percent in 2016, making it the best performing currency the second year in a row. If last year is any indication, bitcoin’s price could reach $2,200 by the end of 2017.

Like price, regulations, and merchant adoption, software development is a major metric that can be used to gauge the growth of Bitcoin. The number of projects involving Bitcoin on the leading development platform and repository, Github, crossed over 10,000 last week and is currently sitting at 10,055 at press time. Also read: Zeronet Wants to Replace the Dark Web by Marrying Bitcoin to Bittorrent Over Tor Like Bitcoin, most projects on Github are open source, meaning that anyone can copy them to make new versions with the changes they want. These spin-off projects are called ‘forks’. Bitcoin currently has 7,535 forked projects on Github, many of which are altcoins. Meanwhile, a search on the site for “Bitcoin” yields 10,055 Bitcoin-related projects. Putting this number into perspective, Bitcoin.com examined the search results for other protocols for comparison. Protocols with more projects than Bitcoin
The largest protocol, Http, which all website developers use, has 291,882 projects on Github today. Wifi is another extremely common protocol but only has 14,889 projects listed while Bluetooth technology has 13,624. Since Bitcoin currently has 10,055 projects and is climbing, it could surpass Bluetooth this year. Protocols with fewer projects than Bitcoin
Bitcoin has already surpassed so many other popular protocols. For instance, FTP, the old standard for uploading files from desktops to any servers, has 8,657 projects on Github today while Secure Socket Layer (SSL), used for standard website communication, only has 7,129 projects. VPNs have 4,036 open source projects, which include all reputable VPN service providers. SMTP mail server projects total 3,693, and surprisingly, the basic protocol of the internet itself, TCP/IP, only has 1,861 projects on Github currently. Bitcoin is already the most popular protocol for money over the internet. The entire category of cryptocurrency, excluding Bitcoin, has 2,147 projects running today. Meanwhile, Paypal and Visa only have 3,904 and 1,672 open source projects respectively, since at least some of their code is closed source. In other categories of protocols, home automation is one of the largest niche markets to compete with Bitcoin, currently having 5,161 projects. Bittorrent has 1,940 projects while the Interplanetary File System (IPFS) has 777. The vast number of complementary projects to Bitcoin on Github represents the greater Bitcoin ecosystem. They include everything from wallets to code libraries to exchanges and even bitcoin trading bots. Many reputable companies like Bitpay and Blockchain place the code for their products on Github to help create transparency and build confidence among their customers. Projects are also ranked by popularity on Github. Other than Bitcoin’s code libraries and other versions of the Bitcoin code itself, the most popular Bitcoin projects include Zeronet, the Brave Browser, a Bittorrent/Github fusion called Gittorrent, Andreas Antonopoulos’ book entitled “Mastering Bitcoin”, Bitpay’s operating system called Bitcore, a trading bot called Gekko, the Electrum wallet, an Arbitrage trading bot, and the classic CPUMiner software.

2017-03-08T06:00:24-04:00,"Tension Rises Around Bitcoin’s Fees, Unspendable Addresses and Spam",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/tension-rises-around-bitcoins-fees-unspendable-addresses-and-spam/,"Bitcoin fees have been rising significantly over the past year and a half. Fees have risen to over $1.00 in some cases for a normal transaction, and that still doesn’t guarantee the fastest confirmation. This week one bitcoin observer noted on Reddit it’s likely that 55.2 percent of addresses don’t have enough funds to cover current fees. Also Read: The New 110% Unlimited Bitcoin.com Mining Pool is Now Open to Everyone As Bitcoin.com reported last month, bitcoin transaction fees have increased by more than 1200 percent since 2015. To many bitcoin proponents, the current fee market is moving way too fast, making bitcoin unusable for certain transactions. Over the past six months, transaction fees have increased exponentially, and the rising fee market doesn’t seem to be slowing down. The fee market and slow confirmation times have also increased the tension concerning the block size debate. There are those that believe rising transaction fees and $100 per transaction is fine. However, if there are wallets with low amounts of bitcoin that can’t cover the fees, they become virtually unspendable. One Redditor suggests the amount of small unspendable addresses are probably larger than many think and may amount to millions of dollars worth of unspendable bitcoins. The contention in the community has created many different topics on how to best scale bitcoin. A user-activated soft fork (UASF) has been widely discussed for Segwit activation, and some industry members believe the process is controversial. Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) has been gaining significantly more hashrate as some believe it’s the best way to proceed. The large mining pool Antpool has just recently mined blocks signaling BU support. Then there have been heated debates concerning what you can and cannot use bitcoin for, like buying coffee or some types of micro-transactions. Just recently an announcement was made by a voting organization who explained a stress test was to be performed on the Bitcoin blockchain on March 6. The Reddit announcement states, “Over 1 million votes per minute will be anchored to the Bitcoin blockchain, for a total of approximately 1.5 billion votes over the 24 hours. This will take place through approximately 11,000 transactions over 24 hours. This is about 4 percent of Bitcoin’s capacity so may cause increased confirmation times and/or fees.” The topic had caused immediate controversy regarding whether or not people have the “right to use the network in this way. Bitcoin developer Lukejr considered the stress test a “spam” attack and expressed his opinion that the act of processing that many transactions should be illegal. In fact, Lukejr states that he reported the issue to the Australian cyber-crime agency. “We’ll see,” explains bitcoin developer Lukejr. “It’d likely be under cyber-crime laws (it’s a DoS attack), not spam laws. I’ve reported you to the Australian cyber-crime agency. Hopefully, they will act to stop you before your attack.” Many hope the debate can come to a compromise on both sides, but there are many different wheels turning on how to best proceed with scaling. There is a significant disagreement on what you can use bitcoin for and polarized opinions concerning the rising fee market as well. What is clear is that many people are considerably unhappy with high fees and slow confirmation times and some believe it is hindering the digital currency’s growth. If there is a significant amount of unspendable addresses and there are certain rules to how you can utilize a decentralized cryptocurrency, then the issue should probably be addressed as soon as possible. What do you think about the rising fee market and unspendable addresses? Do you think there are certain transactions that bitcoin should not be used for? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-03-08T00:00:00-04:00,Texas Lawmaker: No Government Shall Prohibit Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/texan-constitutional-right-own-bitcoin/,"The lone star state of Texas has always been well-known for its stance on constitutional rights. On March 2, State Representative Matt Schaefer submitted a proposal to revise the state’s constitution to say that virtual currencies like bitcoin are mediums of exchange that “no government shall prohibit”. The Texas lawmaker wants it to be known that the use of digital currencies is a citizen’s fundamental right. The recently submitted Texas House Joint Resolution 89 proposes to change Article I of the state’s constitution which says that people have the right to use a variety of mediums of exchange. Just as the state of Texas vehemently opposes government interference with gun rights, the amendment would protect currencies like bitcoin in this fashion. Resolution 89 states: Cryptocurrency use has certainly increased in certain parts of Texas over the years with many proponents and companies based in the area. For instance, Texas is home to digital currency companies such as Factom, Stash Incorporated, Coinvault, Techendeavors, and the radio broadcast, the Crypto Show. The state of Texas is also home to 48 bitcoin automated tellers and many meetup groups which take place in Dallas, Austin, and Houston. Furthermore, there are many unique merchants in Texas that accept the currency as well, including the Capital Coin & Bullion and Central Texas Gunworks. Bitcoin.com chatted with the Austin-based Crypto Show host, Dan Sessoms, who explains his opinion of the proposed constitutional amendment. Sessoms tells Bitcoin.com: “I don’t know that bitcoin or any other crypto is more popular in Texas than other states. It does seem to be popular in Austin though. I would attribute that to Austin being a major Tech hub”. The Crypto Show host adds: “The recent news of adding Bitcoin to a constitutional amendment in Texas is somewhat encouraging, but I don’t recall ever asking permission from anyone to use Bitcoin. There have been several politicians in the past that have ‘elected’ to accept bitcoin as a donation option for their campaign, but let’s face it, that was pure greed, and those politicians wouldn’t lift a finger to help Bitcoin. Governor Greg Abbot accepted bitcoin, but it’s unlikely he’ll support this amendment. This is a guy who has sworn that marijuana legalization will not happen on his watch. Real forward-thinking guy. I guess it would be nice see a constitutional amendment, but I won’t be heartbroken if it doesn’t happen”. The proposed amendment will be submitted to voters in November 2017.

Also Read: Bitcoin Goes into Hiding in Crisis-Stricken Venezuela Bitwala says they are pleased to announce the company’s bitcoin-to-M-Pesa service. Users of the platform can now send bitcoin to an M-Pesa account in Kenya, Nigeria, Uganda, and Tanzania free of charge. M-Pesa is a widely used mobile phone-based money system used in Afghanistan, India and Africa. The mobile currency is predominantly used in Kenya and Tanzania, therefore giving users in the region access to much-needed remittance services. The mobile money has allowed anyone without a bank account to transfer funds using a registered sim-card and has become a disruptive force within the region. “We want to be a part of the mobile money revolution, and we’re stepping it up a notch by enabling anyone to send money to any M-Pesa account using bitcoins,” details Bitwala CEO Jörg von Minckwitz. The payment startup Bitwala believes transferring money should be “fast, cheap and secure” for anyone in the world. In regions such as Kenya, where M-Pesa is used quite a bit to transfer money, Kenyans transacted $28 billion using the service in 2015. This number is sure to rise, says Bitwala, as mobile phone penetration in sub-Saharan Africa grows exponentially. To send money to any M-Pesa account utilizing Bitwala’s latest service, users simply register with the platform, choose a “mobile money” payment, and then an invoice to be paid in bitcoin is sent to the user. The startup hopes the new service will become a reliable money transfer solution for everyone. After the announcement was publicized, one bitcoin enthusiast asked, “What will prevent you from having the same problems as Bitpesa in Kenya?” Bitpesa has been trying for years to connect sub-Saharan Africans with the same type of solutions. But, in 2015, the startup had legal issues with the owners of M-Pesa, Safaricom, which took the case to the Kenyan High Court. The mobile money operator made it difficult for Bitpesa to conduct transactions through Safaricom’s gateway services like Lipisha. Bitpesa has since been making other connections to help with the African remittance service by partnering with other financial institutions in Japan, China and more. Safaricom explained to the High Court that there were regulatory concerns with bitcoin, and companies are required to obtain a license for these types of transfers.

2017-03-07T07:30:42-04:00,Antpool Signals for Bitcoin Unlimited,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/antpool-signals-bitcoin-unlimited/,"The Bitcoin block size debate heated up on Monday as Antpool officially entered the fray. The largest mining pool is now signaling for Bitcoin Unlimited (BU). Also read: New 22 Petahash Mining Pool Signaling Bitcoin Unlimited  Antpool controls the largest percentage of Bitcoin’s mining hashrate, currently at 15.28 percent of the total mining power. Despite previously refraining from signaling for any Bitcoin client, the pool began mining its first BU-signaling block, number 456039, on Monday. At press time, five BU-signaling blocks have been mined by Antpool in total, representing a third of the total number of blocks mined by the pool during that time. These blocks can be tracked on several different websites such as Coin Dance which shows BU achieving a new high, at 22.8 percent of the total network hashrate. Meanwhile, competing client Segwit is signaling at 25.7 percent, down a couple of percentage points from the previous day. BU’s overall block count is creeping very close to overtaking Segwit once again.  In order for Bitcoin miners to make their choice between upgrading to Bitcoin Unlimited, Segwit, or any other version of Bitcoin, they must edit their mining software to make a small mark on the blocks that they mine. This small flag is called a ‘versionbit’ and its only purpose is to reveal to the world their choice of software client. Only Bitcoin miners can make these ‘votes’ and only when they have successfully mined a block. When enough blocks are mined and signaled with the same versionbit, the new client software can be safely upgraded by those miners with little fear of the network splitting into two different Bitcoins. However, if the miners attempt to upgrade to a new, incompatible version of Bitcoin before enough miners are signaling the same version, Bitcoin could split into two or more different Bitcoins, like Ethereum’s blockchain split last summer. Such a move could destroy investor confidence in Bitcoin, a fate that most people want to avoid. Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu, whose company runs Antpool, has not specifically revealed the reason why he has started signaling for BU. However, many people in the Bitcoin community have speculated that the move may be in response to recent calls for a “User Activated Soft Fork” (UASF) which would theoretically transfer the power of signaling for the next version of Bitcoin away from Bitcoin miners into the hands of node operators instead. Wu disapproved of the concept and tweeted his response shortly after the idea was suggested. “UASF will split the blockchain and create 2 or 3 kinds of Bitcoin if majority miners vote “no”. Exchanges should be careful”, Wu tweeted. What do you think of Antpool signaling for BU? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-03-06T20:30:39-04:00,The New 110% Unlimited Bitcoin.com Mining Pool is Now Open to Everyone,Bitcoin.com,https://news.bitcoin.com/new-unlimited-bitcoin-com-mining-pool-now-open/,"Bitcoin.com is pleased to announce that our new mining pool is coming out of private beta and is available to the public from today. The Bitcoin.com Mining Pool is giving miners a unique opportunity to join a growing pool that has one of the most profitable incentive systems for miners around. Also Read: Historic Day For Bitcoin As Bitcoin.com Pool Starts Mining This past September Bitcoin.com started mining with its very own pool and mined its first block, 430757, on Wednesday, September 21, 2016. The following month our mining pool steadily increased its hashrate capturing 1 percent of the global network in October. Since then the pool’s computational power has increased, currently running at 80 Ph/s and handling 2.456 percent of the global hashrate. Bitcoin.com’s Chief Technical Officer, Emil Oldenburg, who helped get the mining pool up and running gives our readers some insight about the pool. Oldenburg tells us he helped develop the pool with Bitcoin.com’s developer Shaun Chong, and Bitcoin Unlimited developers Andrew Stone and Andrea Suisani. Furthermore, the CTO explains the new pool offers miners incentives like no other mining program and encourages people to join the group. “We are paying more on Pay-Per-Share (PPS) than any other pool,” explains Oldenburg. “We pay a 110% block reward, and charge 0% fees for PPS and Pay Per Last N Shares (PPLNS). Bitcoin.com’s mining pool pays PPS directly instead of giving miners some fees after the blocks are mined. Our reward scheme is simpler and is guaranteed to make the miner more money regardless of luck.” Bitcoin.com’s Mining Pool is also the world’s first large pool fully dedicated to Bitcoin Unlimited. Oldenburg details the operations are global with servers in the U.S., China, and Europe. Additionally, Bitcoin.com’s mining pool has fast block transmission times using a global relay network built on Bitcoin Unlimited Xthin and Xpedited blocks. Today begins the first invite to the general public, offering a mining pool with a significant incentive for miners. Moreover, Bitcoin.com’s Mining Pool is leading the change for bigger blocks by voting with hashpower to end congestion within the network. In addition to the pool, Oldenburg reveals that a transaction accelerator platform is also coming in the near future. Oldenburg added, “I really wish transaction accelerators weren’t necessary. We need to remove the block size from the consensus code like Bitcoin Unlimited has done and let the blocks be as big as necessary. This will lead to a healthier and more innovative discussion on blockchain and transaction optimizations. We can’t fix the congestion by building a transaction accelerator; we must raise the block size limit.” For more information about Bitcoin.com’s Mining Pool, there is an official discussion thread located in our forum here, and people can also email us at pool@bitcoin.com for questions and support.

2017-03-06T19:00:08-04:00,Many Are Mulling Over the Idea of Retiring on Bitcoin,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/many-mulling-over-idea-retiring-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin has surpassed the value of gold for the first time. In parallel, Bitcoin’s deflationary properties are becoming more relevant as the specter of inflation starts lurking again in the U.S. and the Euro area. As a result, for many, the thought of investing their retirement savings in bitcoins is starting to gain traction. Also read: Bitcoin Offers Diversification For Retirement Portfolios The idea of retiring on Bitcoin is not new. For years, users in forums related to the cryptocurrency have been discussing this topic. The question of how many bitcoins would be required to retire was often posted in Bitcoin forums. For example, in April 2014, Bitcoin forum user Alley asked, “How many bitcoins do I need to retire in 20 years?” To which, in turn, user Tron replied that to be safe two bitcoins would be required. Now, because of the stellar performance of the cryptocurrency, many individuals are again becoming tempted to explore the idea of using bitcoins for retirement purposes. In this regard, Reddit user ‘Markb’ prepared a series of calculations to figure out how many bitcoins you would need to retire. For example, one of Markb’s assumptions is: “The price of bitcoin doubles every year and tops out at $1 million, and you need $32k to live on.” You can see Markb’s calculations here. Of course, like with any retirement investment plan, you must first study the basics of money and, in this case, Bitcoin, and diversify your retirement savings. Inflation represents a huge risk and challenge to any retirement savings strategy. People are living longer. Therefore, the danger of inflation eroding their savings increases with each passing year. Unfortunately, the significance of the inflation factor is now growing as it begins to show its ugly face in the US and the Eurozone. In the Euro area, inflation reached 2 percent in February 2017. This rate was higher than the Central Banks’ expectations, the BBC reported. In the US, the inflation rate increased 2.5 percent year-on-year in January 2017, following a 2.1 percent increase in December. This increment was higher than the market expectations, according to Trading Economics. Certainly, the situation is even more dreadful for those retiring in countries such as Venezuela and Sudan, which exhibited inflation rates of 475 percent and 476 percent respectively, in 2016.  You can also estimate how much more income you will require from now until your retirement age, factoring inflation, using this calculator. A key feature that makes the cryptocurrency unique and most relevant for retirement savings is that Bitcoin is deflationary. Indeed, Bitcoin is an antidote for countries afflicted by galloping inflation. Bitcoin is an effective tool to mitigate the risk of inflation, simply because production will never exceed more than 21 million bitcoins. This quantity will be reached by the year 2140 when the last bitcoin will be generated. The anti-inflationary virtue of Bitcoin is evident. Since its genesis in 2008, when Satoshi Nakamoto published the white paper “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System,” the value of Bitcoin has had a rough but upward trajectory. It is amazing to consider how Bitcoin has grown from the first Bitcoin business transaction, when a Bitcoin Forum user paid 10,000 bitcoins for a pizza worth $25, in May 2010. As of this writing, 10,000 bitcoins is equal to $12,500,000. Moreover, retirement investment instruments using Bitcoin are already appearing in the market. One example is the qualified Bitcoin-based Individual Retirement Account, Bitcoinira. Bitcoin is becoming more stable, stronger, and more of a mainstream currency. These elements, combined with Bitcoin’s inflation-resistant feature, will continue prompting the creation of novel retirement investment vehicles, tempting many to explore Bitcoin as an investment option for retirement savings.

Gandhi, gave a keynote address last week at a fintech conference stating that Bitcoin has value and is eliminating currency. However, he also gave several reasons why digital currencies that are not backed by the government will fail to achieve mass adoption. Also read: Bitcoin Startups Form Association After India’s Virtual Currency Warning  Fintech players, leading bankers, technology experts, and policymakers gathered last Wednesday in Mumbai at the conference called Picup (Platform for Innovation and Collaboration with Upcoming and Promising) Fintech 2017. The event was organized by a collaborative effort of IT industry body Nasscom, industry chamber Ficci, Indian Banks’ Association (IBA), and the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The Deputy Governor opened the event with a 20-minute inaugural address. He discussed fintech, crowdfunding, blockchain technology and Bitcoin, with the general subject of digital currency taking up the latter half of his speech. Gandhi introduced Bitcoin by giving a short history of its origins, explaining that the digital currency is rooted in “anarchist philosophy”. He then outlined a few previous attempts at a stateless digital currency from the Cypherpunks movement mentioning May, Back, Dai, and Szabo by name before noting that: After highlighting Bitcoin’s accomplishments to date, Gandhi gave many reasons why “the masses” will not prefer it, claiming that Bitcoin has only flourished among its “initial rounds and circles”. He also alleged that the confidence in Bitcoin, or any other digital currencies based on a blockchain, is limited to its early adopters and those who are more comfortable with risk. “The initial round is always filled with adventurists and risk seekers”, he conveyed. “The moment the masses get in, the risk avoiders get in, they will need greater confidence for its acceptance and continuance, and that can come only if an authority endorses it”, he said. The broader public, he described, will be unlikely to embrace Bitcoin because the authorities have not done so. For instance, “No established framework for recourse to customer problems, disputes and grievances, and chargebacks etc. is feasible with this kind of framework”, he said. Claiming that the mainstream will not have confidence in digital currencies as a replacement for state-issued currency, he noted: “We can see that in these types of virtual currencies, there is no central bank or monetary authority”, he expressed. “They pose potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security-related risks”. The anonymous nature of Bitcoin will also frighten them, he claimed. Despite admitting that bitcoin has eliminated some amount of currency, the central bank governor said: “It may remain a pipe dream that blockchain will eliminate currency by ushering in virtual currency. It is unlikely”.  What do you think of the RBI’s view on Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-03-06T06:00:27-04:00,A French Bitcoiner Argues in New York Court its too early to Regulate Bitcoin,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/a-french-bitcoiner-argues-its-too-early-to-regulate-bitcoin-in-new-york-court/,"A Bitcoiner has been suing the New York Division of Financial Services over its ‘Bitlicense’ since 2015, claiming the regulation is too burdensome and precludes many from starting Bitcoin businesses.  Bitcoin entrepreneur and French national Theo Chino requested that a New York court grant a request for limited discovery or begin the process to dismiss the case. The request centers on the notion that the definitions of bitcoin between the two parties are too different, and more research is thus needed to better define Bitcoin. According to plaintiff Mr. Chino, the case “cannot be resolved without making further factual determination as to whether Bitcoin is a ‘financial product or service.’” Related: Some Blockchain Tokens Are Securities, Researchers Find The case highlights whether the “virtual currency” regulation by the New York State Department of Financial Services was “designed and issued by Defendants-Respondents in an arbitrary and capricious fashion.” The lawsuit’s most recent filing continues: “There are significant and irreconcilable factual differences between the arguments presented by Plaintiff-Petitioner and by Defendants-Respondents which can only be resolved through limited discovery. Those fundamental factual differences and disputes involve whether Bitcoin is a ‘financial product’ or service which impacts whether Defendants-Respondents had the authority to regulate Bitcoin, and whether Defendants-Respondents acted in an arbitrary and capricious fashion when they designed the Regulation.” The court must grant such a request when a petition “is likely to be material and necessary to the prosecution or defense of the proceedings.” If Bitcoin is not a “financial product or service,” then the NYFDS’ cross-motion to dismiss should be denied. Indeed, regulators worldwide continue examining the regulatory implications of bitcoin. Government reports issued this year on distributed ledger technology, sometimes referred to as ‘blockchain’, imply market regulators are investigating related technologies in the context of current and possible future laws and regulations.  “It is premature to fully appreciate the changes that the technology could bring and the regulatory response that may be needed, given that the technology is still evolving and practical applications are limited both in number and scope,” reads a recent report by the European Securities and Markets Authority called ‘The Distributed Ledger Technology Applies to Securities Markets.’ FINRA stated in a report called ‘Implications of Blockchain for Securities Markets‘ that it “welcomes an open dialogue with market participants to help proactively identify and address any potential risks or hurdles in order to tap into the full potential of DLT, while maintaining the core principles of investor protection and market integrity.” The UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (“FINMA”), and the Monetary Authority of Singapore (“MAS”) have all created so-called “regulatory sandboxes” to better understand blockchain technology.  The hearing between Theo Chino and the NYFDS is scheduled for March 16, 2017 at 9:30 A.M. Do you think it is time to regulate Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments section below.   Images courtesy of Shutterstock, NYFDS, Twitter

2017-03-06T01:00:57-04:00,Bitcoiners Beware â U.S. Customs Agents Are Coercing for Mobile Passwords,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoiners-aware-u-s-customs-coercing-mobile-passwords/,"Now bitcoiners have another topic to consider as Trump has beefed up U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) policies with agents searching the phones of travelers at border checkpoints. Also read:Â The Digital Revolution Increases Sovereignty Bitcoin.com has covered many different aspects concerningÂ Bitcoin under the Trump administration. Everything from Bitcoin supporters beingÂ appointedÂ to the administration, the plannedÂ wall in Mexico, and the possibility of some financial regulations ending.Â However,Â Bitcoin proponents may have something to worry about if they travel inside the U.S. border. According to various reports, CBP agents are increasingly searching phones and electronic devices. Even though the CBP and the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) legally cannot search electronic devices without a warrant they have been doing so for quite some time. Just recently a U.S.-born scientist was forced to reveal his NASA-issued mobile phone password at a border checkpoint. Sidd Bikkannavar gave up the passcode to the CBP agent while he waited thirty minutes for it to be returned. According to the CBP the agents had performed an algorithm test looking for threats to national security, but found none. âThis is a huge, huge violation of my work policy. This is a matter of great concern,â explained Bikkannavar.  The violation of privacy is setting a precedent and could have severe implications towards bitcoin users keeping wealth on their mobile devices. Moreover, there have been other recorded events in the U.S. of border agents looking for passwords to electronic devices over the past few months. Just last month theÂ New York Times reported on a man named Haisam Elsharkawi who was detained by the CBP for three hours after his flight. According to Elsharkawi, CBP officials pestered him for the phones passphrase and asked if they could view his contacts, social media apps, and photographs. âI travel all the time, and I was never asked to unlock my phone,â Mr. Elsharkawi told the press. âI have personal photos there, which I think is normal for anyone. Itâs my right. Itâs my phone.â According to the CBP, the agency details they can seize your mobile device and may keep it to copy data off of the device. Those who have experienced a phone seizure have said the agency could take your phone for weeks as the CBP states they will âreturn your property within a reasonable time upon completion of examination.â One instance of Bitcoin going through customs made headlines back in March of 2014. Bitcoin Not Bombs founder, Davi Barker was harassed by a group of plain-clothed TSA agents. Barker’s luggage was swabbed as the TSA employees said, “We saw bitcoin in your bag and need to check.” According to the agents, the security team was concerned with international travelers carrying more than $10,000 in digital currency. Â Â  The fact of the matter is a lot of bitcoin users carry funds on their mobile device. Phones contain bitcoin wallets, and some even show a mnemonic seed phrase to your private keys. On top of that,Â government authorities can take the device and copy all the data using their own discretion, and ironically, in private. Additionally, the CBP may also share the device with other agencies for technical assistance and decryption. Of course, agents will need a passphrase, but it seems coercing people to give one up is all too easy these days. The implications of these events with U.S. customs can be frightening for all individuals who recognize privacy as a fundamental sovereign right. All of the sudden, certain rules under Trumpâs new guidelines may not be so pleasing to bitcoin enthusiasts after all.

2017-03-05T19:00:08-04:00,Bitcoin Goes into Hiding in Crisis-Stricken Venezuela,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-hiding-crisis-stricken-venezuela/,"Protests have been ongoing in Venezuela as the country’s economic crisis has only grown far worse over the past three years. In the meanwhile, Bitcoin has been adopted by many in the country to survive. As her foreign reserves fall to $10 billion, Venezuela is on the frontier of where Bitcoin and failing governments collide. The nation’s poverty rate of 82% is double the 46% rate in 2014. Surbitcoin, the nation’s most popular bitcoin exchange service, was forced to cease trading in early February when its bank account was closed. This has since led to a spike in Bitcoin trading on Localbitcoins.
  Related: Surbitcoin Shuts Down Amid Bitcoin Crackdown The fact that people have turned to black markets to procure goods amid hyperinflation could have led to the growing interest in the digital currency there. The situation has led to an official exchange rate of 9.900 bolivars per dollar, though on the black market the exchange rate is 4,000 VEF/USD, which includes the bitcoin for bolivars rate. Some have turned to selling the nation’s coins for scrap metal, since it offers a better return than holding onto the money for its fiat value.  “Some people eat twice per day at most, and very few calories in food,” says Venezuela native Randy Brito. “Some people know about bitcoin, and they can buy food and medicines with it, but they prefer to be quiet and not make that public to avoid being arrested and to avoid the government taking more action prohibiting bitcoin. This means others don’t learn about bitcoin so it depresses its value due to the lesser demand.” Mr. Brito, who now lives in Spain, says everyone knows corrupt Venezuelan police are raiding mines to extort miners and to take the mines for themselves to generate bitcoins or sell the equipment on the black market. He says authorities also trade bitcoins they seize on the black market. “Just like they do with the dollars and food,” Mr. Brito says. “Everyone knows that, that’s how life works in Venezuela. Corrupt officials import things people need or steal them from importers, then sell them on the black market. They are doing the same thing with mining devices.”  There was an 11,000 mining farm earlier in 2017, as well as another raid on a bitcoin mining farm in Caracas around the same time. Surbitcoin’s banking partner, Banesco, closed the firm’s account, according to the Venezuelan exchange. But, this is common for Bitcoin businesses worldwide, including in the United States and Europe. In a social media group dedicated to Bitcoin in Venezuela, Bitcoin.com fielded comments by members about the most unique aspects of Bitcoin in Venezuela when compared to other countries. “Bitcoin is illegal according to the government,” replied one commenter sarcastically, evoking recent events in the nation. Others complained of the government’s actions against Surbitcoin, lamenting now needing to travel to the nearest cities in order to exchange bitcoin for bolivars. Mr. Brito believes that many of Venezuela’s most influential people, if they learned about Bitcoin, could help the plight of Venezuelans by educating them. “They are not leaving the country, but they are also not calling for disobedience, nor for people to buy bitcoin or other hard currencies,” he laments.

Over the past few months, many Bitcoin proponents have been focused on the Tumblebit project, a protocol that aims to anonymize transactions. This week, the blockchain development company Stratis has announced “Breeze Wallet”, a protocol that will implement Tumblebit into a “real-world production environment.” Stratis is a blockchain development platform that allows developers and enterprises the ability to test and deploy blockchain-based applications. The platform equips programmers with a blockchain building interface using C# and the Microsoft .NET Framework. The company, founded in 2016 by Chris Trew, aims to provide clients with end-to-end solutions for distributed ledger development. Earlier this year, the startup announced the company’s daemon alpha release that affords users the ability to publicly test a Bitcoin full node written in C# for the .NET Core platform. With the help of Bitcoin core developer Nicolas Dorier, the platform allows testing concepts like Tumblebit and Segregated witness in a production environment. On March 2, the company announced project “Breeze Wallet” which they claim will be one of the first Bitcoin wallets to address the privacy issues in blockchain transactions. “Presently there is a huge demand for privacy on the blockchain”, Stratis details. “One of the main hurdles faced by the adoption of blockchain technologies in the financial services industry is the privacy of financial data on the blockchain”. To be able to build the Breeze Wallet to the Tumblebit specifications, the company will be helped by Adam Ficsor, a contributor to the Tumblebit research paper. Stratis details Ficsor will give technical advisement towards the development of a production-ready Tumblebit full block SPV wallet in C#. The team hopes Breeze Wallet could become the “de-facto wallet” that offers enhanced privacy for bitcoin transactions worldwide. According to Ficsor, blockchain surveillance is a not at all theoretical and unfortunately a reality for cryptocurrency users. “Everyone who is not using Bitcoin Core had all their addresses linked together by third parties”, Ficsor explains. “This is not a theoretical “assume the worst case” strategy; this is reality. The third parties are either the central servers your wallet relies on or, in case of SPV wallets, all blockchain surveillance companies”. Currently, there is no completion date set for the Breeze Wallet project. Stratis says Tumblebit is fully compatible with today’s Bitcoin protocol and the startup says they have taken the initial steps to make Tumblebit a “reality in the shortest term”. What do you think about Stratis developing a Tumblebit SPV wallet? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Pixabay, and the Stratis website.

The Deputy Director of the Central Bank of Nigeria’s Banking and Payments System (CBN), Musa Itopa-Jimoh, spoke at the meeting. In an interview afterwards, he clarified the CBN’s stance on bitcoin, citing that a lot of people misinterpret the central bank’s recent warning.Â  Also read: Nigerian SEC Associates Shady MLM Schemes Like Onecoin With Bitcoin The meeting was entitled ‘Virtual/Cryptocurrency: Evolution, Regulatory Challenges and Impact on the Future of Payments and Settlement Systems’. Dr. Uche Olowo, First Vice President of the CBN, in his opening remarks, talked about why the institute considers this topic crucial for the Nigerian financial market, starting with bitcoin. Citing both curiosity and caution about bitcoin from the global financial community, he said “on the one hand interested parties view it as the highest performing and the most valuable currency in the world”. On the other hand, âit is seen by most traditional financial players as unstable and complicated, and with doubts of its inherent valueâ. Nonetheless, he said that bitcoin âhas the power to greatly affect the more traditional means of payments and settlement systems, globallyâ. The impact of cryptocurrencies was discussed throughout the event, and after the meeting, Mr. Musa Itopa-Jimoh said: Nigeria has issued several warnings against a few cryptocurrencies in the past, including bitcoin. On January 12, the CBN issued a circular to banks and other financial institutions on virtual currency operations in Nigeria, requiring them to take certain actions relating to digital currencies. The notice reads: “The CBN reiterates that VCs [virtual currencies] such as Bitcoin, Ripples, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Onecoin, etc, and similar products are not legal tenders in Nigeria, thus any bank or institution that transacts in such businesses does so at its own riskâ. On the same day, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a statement cautioning citizens from investing in Bitcoin, Onecoin, and Swisscoin. Putting them in the same category, the SEC told the Nigerian public that such investments are risky by nature and some of them are âfraudulent pyramid schemes.â The public notice reads âThe public is hereby advised to exercise extreme caution with regard to digital (cryptocurrencies) as a vehicle of investmentsâ. Despite all the warnings, Mr. Musa Itopa-Jimoh clarified that the CBN has no intention of stopping bitcoin usage. “We are not the issuing authority for bitcoin. It’s not our currency. We do not control it. We don’t issue it, we don’t control it,” he said. “we are just issuing caution to Nigerians”, he continued, citing that if they participated in cryptocurrencies, they cannot come to the CBN for consumer protection “because it is not within our control”. He noted that: He added that all the CBN is doing is cautioning Nigerians when dealing or investing in digital currencies since they are not under the control of the central bank.

Many have even gone so far as to claim that Bitcoin is unstable without full blocks, while completely ignoring that the blocks were not full for the first 8 years of Bitcoin’s existence. As any Bitcoin user knows, the network is completely full now.  Every business is spending countless hours dealing with customer support requests relating to transaction that haven’t confirmed. In the last year confirmation times have gone up from about 10 minutes, to nearly two hours! I was stunned earlier today when I came across a service that now allows people to pay with CREDIT CARDS to have their Bitcoin transaction confirmed!  This certainly isn’t the bitcoin that I signed up for, and I think everyone should be shocked by how bad things have now gotten thanks to Core and Blockstream’s misguided economic policies. Segwit is not the answer. It is worth noting that this kind of fee market is exactly what the current Core team have been advocating for years. Now they have it, and it is a disaster just like myself, Gavin Andresen, and many others have been saying all along. The owners of Friendster, and then Myspace thought that it would be impossible for any other social network to supplant their position. Facebook proved them wrong.  The current Core developers think that it is impossible for any currency to supplant Bitcoin, but if Bitcoin doesn’t grow and adapt to keep up with consumer demand, it will be replaced by something that does, and it will be the current Core developer’s fault for blocking every on chain scaling attempt and intentionally implementing disastrous economic policies. If you love Bitcoin and want to see it become a currency used all over the world,  it is time to reject the insane economic policies of Blockstream and Core,  and support Bitcoin Unlimited instead.

2017-03-04T09:00:42-04:00,North Dakota’s New Bitcoin Bill Fails For Now,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/north-dakotas-new-bitcoin-bill-fails/,"Regulatory policies are forming across many states in the U.S. concerning digital currencies. This week in North Dakota a bitcoin-related bill was unsuccessful moving forward during the state’s House of Representatives vote for Bill 2100.    Last year North Dakota’s Business and Labor Committee created Bill 2100 in order to discover the “feasibility and desirability of regulating virtual currency, such as bitcoin.” The legislative proposal discusses subjects like money transmission, permissible investments, and licensure. Bill 2100 describes bitcoin as a medium of exchange, but one that is not recognized by the federal government, stating:    The digital currency and blockchain legislative advocacy group Coin Center initially criticized Bill 2100 for failing to define what “control” of bitcoins would mean. The organization noted the bill’s original text was amended and the advocacy group said they were pleased to see North Dakota take a “more cautious approach.”  Initially Coin Center took issue with Bill 2100’s legislative interpretations of money transmission control. Coin Center’s Peter Van Valkenburgh explains the legal definition is important to ensure permissionless networks and innovation is not stifled.           “We urge North Dakota to include that definition in their legislation, so that the law would not be amenable to interpretations treating infrastructure providers (multi-sig wallets, lightning network nodes, miners, or full nodes) as money transmitters thus requiring that these low-risk, non-custodial innovators be licensed,” details Coin Center. This past January Bill 2100 passed its way through the Senate’s voting proceedings. The Senate hearing for Bill 2100 passed unanimously with 46 votes and quickly found its way to the House of Representatives. On February 9, the House began its first reading of the virtual currency mandates referred by the Business and Labor Committee. During the second reading on March 1, Bill 2100 failed to pass with only four ‘Yeas‘ and an overwhelming 84 ‘Nays‘. The North Dakota Bill failed similarly to the recent California virtual currency bill, which lawmakers may attempt to resubmit. Government officials in California said they would resubmit their legislative framework in 2017 and North Dakota’s Bill 2100 could also go back to the Senate, as well. Bitcoin proponents are watching these legislative attempts and policies very closely hoping innovation will not be squelched. Regulations can cause burdens to bitcoin startups and customers residing in a particular region. For instance, Coinbase has recently announced it would be ceasing operations in Hawaii due to regulatory policy. Bitfinex explained they would not obtain a license to operate in Washington State. Furthermore, regulatory burden from New York’s Bitlicense had caused businesses to leave in droves. Many bitcoin advocates hope lawmakers take a more cautious approach.

The Commission has stated that this deadline is March 11, which has caused some confusion in the Bitcoin community since this date falls on a Saturday. A clause in the SEC’s rulebook pushes the deadline to March 13. Also read: SEC Begins Soliciting Comments On Bitcoin Investment Trust  On January 4, the SEC issued a notice stating that it has designated “March 11, 2017 as the date by which the Commission should either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change (File No. SR-BatsBZX-2016-30), as modified by Amendment No. 1”. This rule change concerns the listing and trading of Coin ETF on the Bats Global Market exchange. March 11 is 240 days from July 14, 2016, the date which the proposed rule change was published for notice and comment in the Federal Register. However, March 11 falls on a Saturday this year, a day in which U.S. government offices are closed. Title 17 of the Code of Federal Regulations, called CFR (Commodity and Securities Exchanges), has a section that addresses ‘time computation’. 17 CFR part 201 of Rule 160 (§201.160) states that “In computing any period of time prescribed in or allowed by these Rules of Practice or by order of the Commission, the day of the act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall not be included”. The Commission further wrote that: In addition, 17 CFR 240.19b-4 – ‘Filings with respect to proposed rule changes by self-regulatory organizations’ states that: “A ‘‘business day’’ is any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, Federal holiday, a day that the Office of Personnel Management has announced that Federal agencies in the Washington, DC area are closed to the public, a day on which the Commission is subject to a Federal government shutdown or a day on which the Commission’s Washington, DC office is otherwise not open for regular business”. The next business day following March 11 per the SEC’s rule is Monday March 13. Managing director and head of research at Blockchain Capital, Spencer Bogart, former Needham analyst who published many reports on Bitcoin and Bitcoin ETFs, confirmed to Bitcoin.com that: After the Coin ETF, Solidx Bitcoin Trust is up next for a decision by the SEC. On January 3, the SEC announced “March 30, 2017 as the date by which the Commission should either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change (File No. SR-NYSEArca-2016-101)”. This rule change pertains to the listing and trading of Solidx Bitcoin Trust on the NYSE Arca. That date will not be pushed forward because March 30 is on a Thursday. The third Bitcoin ETF waiting for a decision by the SEC is Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) to list GBTC on the NYSE Arca. The proposed rule change for the BIT was published in the Federal Register on February 9. The SEC has not announced how long it will take to make a decision on the BIT. However, the latest date it could be is October 7, which is 240 days from February 9. Since this date also falls on a Saturday, the decision on the BIT could be pushed to the following Monday, October 9. By these deadlines, the Commission can either approve or disapprove the rule changes proposed by respective exchanges to list and trade Bitcoin ETFs. The Commission also has the option of doing nothing which means the proposed rule changes will be deemed automatically approved. Do you think the SEC will approve the listing of Coin ETF on March 13?

Breadwallet is a popular wallet application created in 2013 by Voisine and Adam Traidman. Just recently the application became available for Android users, and the startup is currently building a bitcoin exchange feature within the app’s interface.  Voisine gives our readers an in-depth look at how Breadwallet users can verify their app and firmware is legitimate, how restoration of private keys works, and more info on the company’s latest developments. The Breadwallet developer says the team aims to continuously add new interface improvements as well as adding financial services to the Breadwallet app in the near future. Also Read: One Bitcoin Worth More Than One Ounce of Gold for First Time Bitcoin.com (BC): How is it going with the Breadwallet platform and development? Aaron Voisine (AV): Things are going well. We have a small talented and passionate development team. In the last year, we’ve released an Android version of the app, which was a ground-up re-write, and developed a new financial services platform that we’re now using for the ability to purchase bitcoin in the app in beta testing. BC: You guys recently added the Breadwallet platform to Android. Why did it take so long? AV: We did a blog post about this which you can find on the website. We are fanatical about security, and we didn’t feel Android versions before 6.0 had the necessary security safeguards in place to safely store and use bitcoin for the typical user.  BC: Recently the Breadwallet team was looking for testers to purchase Bitcoin via ACH transfer within the mobile wallet interface. Can you tell our readers about this? AV: We’ve developed a financial services platform, which runs in a sandboxed web view in the app. This will allow us to securely provide additional bitcoin services in the wallet, and the first we have planned is a new bitcoin exchange. BC: There’s been a lot of malicious spoof wallets on the App Store lately. How can a user know they are getting the correct Breadwallet app? AV: The simplest way is to follow the app link from breadwallet.com. If you start from within the App Store, check the name of the app publisher and make sure it’s Breadwallet LLC. BC: After installation of the Breadwallet app how can mobile phone owners rest assure that the latest firmware update of the app wasn’t compromised? AV: All App Store apps use code signatures to digitally verify that any updates are from the same publisher that created the app. The OS on your phone verifies this code signature for you. BC: Breadwallet uses a seed phrase to restore private keys. If your company was to go out of business how can users restore their wallet holdings? AV: Private keys are derived directly from the seed phrase, so it doesn’t rely on any services we provide. You can even install the app from a copy in your iTunes library should the app disappear from the App Store, and the source code is also freely available on GitHub, so anyone can build and install it themselves if they wish. BC: How is Breadwallet dealing with the recent rise in miner fees? Has this been an issue for the platform? AV: We’ve had to raise fees in the app several times, and will continue to do so as needed. BC: What’s your opinion of the Bitcoin network in its eighth year?  AV: Bitcoin itself is working very well, apart from the 1Mb block size anti-spam measure that is now limiting legitimate transactions.  BC: What can Breadwallet users expect from the platform in the near future? AV: We’re working on a lot of usability improvements, with things like BIP75 to allow users to send and receive funds to SMS numbers, email addresses, or social media identities in a secure, private and decentralized way. Also, we will be adding more financial services to the platform as they become available, like bill pay and direct payroll deposit, as well as a bitcoin exchange in different markets around the world. What do you think about the Breadwallet app? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Linkedin, and Breadwallet.com. Have you seen our new widget service? It allows anyone to embed informative Bitcoin.com widgets on their website. They’re pretty cool and you can customize by size and color.

2017-03-03T19:00:29-04:00,Zeronet Wants to Replace the Dark Web by Marrying Bitcoin to Bittorrent Over Tor,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/zeronet-replacing-dark-web-marrying-bitcoin-bittorrent-tor/,"A little over two years ago a Hungarian named Tamas Kocsis put together a completely decentralized internet alternative called Zeronet. Using the underlying cryptography behind Bitcoin, every Zeronet ‘website’ address is a Bitcoin public key, so any visitors can send bitcoin directly to the site owner, even if they have not set up a wallet yet. Bitcoin.com talked to Kocsis about his project and its current status.  Also Read: A Decentralized Money Needs A Distributed Web for Maximum Freedom When the project launched in January 2015, the one-man effort had limited functionality with a blogging system and a chatroom board. However, it could soon use the Tor network for privacy, and the ability was there from the start for anyone to make other kinds of websites inside Zeronet, including social sites with dynamically-updating content. Today, many useful Zeronet websites called ‘zites’ have been designed to mimic popular websites and apps like Facebook, Reddit, Twitter, and Popcorntime. The utility of the whole system is now far higher with additions like zite search, a private email client, a file manager, and the Zeronet-wide newsfeed that keeps track of your conversations across all zites. The way Zeronet hosts these private zites in a decentralized manner is simple but effective. Each is treated as a Bittorrent shared file, named by its Bitcoin public key. A user visiting a zite would instantly download it from nearby peer and start seeding for other users to visit. Unlike their Bittorrent counterparts, however, Zeronet files can be updated by anyone visiting the zite, so they can make comments on blog posts or upvote other people’s comments. The end result is a slightly slower internet through a Zeronet browser window that never goes to any domain on the internet; all files are served locally from the folder they were downloaded to. To ensure that each file really came from the site owner intact, and is not edited by someone else on another peer, Kocsis turned to Bitcoin. He explained to Bitcoin.com: The network of zites is steadily growing, and Kocsis sees most new, active users arrive “from countries where the Internet censorship affects their daily life. Like Russia and China”. The developer noted that there is “also significant interest for Europe and North America”, but he believes that the latter users are more interested in the technology itself, unlike the others that need Zeronet for its decentralization offering freedom of speech. Government crackdown is unlikely to have much effect on Zeronet, according to the network’s creator. Not only is the whole system fully Tor enabled, the nature of the network is, much like with Bitcoin addresses, for every zite to survive until every copy of it on every peer has been deleted. “Even if someone starts attacking these computers”, Kocsis mentioned, “then he or she only delay the updates, so I think it will not be so spectacular that make it worth doing it”. When opening up the Zeronet browser, which automatically connects through Tor if available, all users go to the ‘Hello’ page, which is a launch pad to all other zites and displays the feed of all your interactions on Zeronet. The number of users on the system connected is also shown on that page, and this is the only user statistic Kocsis has, he told Bitcoin.com. “There are currently around 1019 user serving the homepage of Zeronet (1HeLLo4uzjaLetFx6NH3PMwFP3qbRbTf3D) 560 of them are using the Tor network”.  Five of the zites available from the page were also made by Kocsis and other developers for Zeronet, including the official Zeronet Blog, the private mail system, a reddit-like forum, a simple chatroom, and Zerome, which is a social network somewhere in between a Facebook wall and Twitter feed. Most zites are spartan versions of their old-net counterparts, with fewer pictures and less colors overall in order to keep file sizes small. Inside Zeronet, finding other users’ content can be done through the zite search or by browsing directories, like the largest one called 0list. One of the first zites most people run across is Zeroplay, which uses Webtorrent to display Bittorrent movies (mostly pirated) right in the browser window, like the controversial Popcorntime app. TV shows and music versions exist as well.  Future plans for expansion include several speed-boosting solutions such as an “archiving solution for bigger sites”, and large-file support that “will allow direct audio and video file sharing” between peers, instead of through Bittorrent. A Bitmessage integration has also been crowdfunded by the Zeronet community. Kocsis is currently looking for someone familiar with the project to help out. “There is a 1BTC bounty on this task”, he said. Once included into Zeronet, the integration “would allow the Zeronet sites to send and receive messages using the BitMessage protocol”, he added. “For example, placing orders in webshops, reporting users to moderator and similar use cases”. It’s already possible to build an ecommerce zite selling goods and services for bitcoin, although it would be a challenge to create it in that environment, well out of reach for non-developers. However, Openbazaar (OB) integration will be easily accomplished once Openbazaar 2.0 launches with its full Tor integration, and there is no reason an OB marketplace cannot be useful to Zeronet zites today due to their Hidden Listings feature. Marking an item as ‘hidden’ inside Openbazaar stores allows “vendors to create private listings that are only visible to people they give the listing address”, Openbazaar’s blog explains. Posting hidden listing links inside Zeronet would effectively create the full Dark Web experience in the newer network, with hidden sites and marketplaces like the Silk Road running as private Openbazaar stores. When asked if there is any advantage for users to do this instead of directly through a Tor browser, Kocsis said that Zeronet would give these admins and users of these marketplaces “higher anonymity, because every peer is equal on ZeroNet, so it’s very hard to find out who is only a visitor and who is the site owner”.

2017-03-03T12:00:23-04:00,"Bitcoin Under Trump, Including a State’s Rights Battle",Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-under-trump-including-a-states-rights-battle/,"Silence surrounds the probable impact of Trump on Bitcoin because there’s a dearth of facts. Some indications hint at a favorable impact however, even as they pose threats to freedom and prosperity. Indeed, sometimes its because of the threat that bitcoin could surge forward as a safe haven and the solution to the problems government creates. Here’s a sampling of what users can expect: two unintended consequences and two slug-matches brewing.  Consider two examples. 1) Trump vows to impound or tax remittances sent by Illegal immigrants back to Mexico because the money constitutes “illegal wages.” ‘Illegal’ Mexicans commonly send most of their earnings back home to their families. According to World Bank estimates, such personal remittances amounted to $26,164,387.99 in 2015. The World Banks added, “three of the most frequently used remittance service companies [are] Western Union (6.1%), MoneyGram (6.64%), CitiBank (14.59%) charge 9.11% on average, excluding the conversion fees.” ‘Illegals’ will almost certainly seek a less formal and untaxed path to send remittances home. And Bitso, the largest bitcoin conversion exchange in Mexico, offers a solution; over 130,000 locations in Mexico conveniently convert pesos and greenbacks in and out of bitcoin. Predictably, if allowed by government, other companies will compete and keep the fees reasonable. Skeptics of crypto-remittances cite the difficulty ‘illegals’ have in obtaining bitcoin. But a January 27 Bitcoin.com article, “How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost,” described how the obstacle could be vaulted. 2. The Trump admin wants to clamp down on marijuana even in states where it is legal.  Former Fed crackdowns have prompted legal marijuana dealers to switch to bitcoin. Operation Choke Point, for example, was a Department of Justice attempt to freeze such dealers out of the traditional banking system. A Nov. 7, 2016, Bitcoin.com article, “Colorado Cannabis Operations Begin Banking With Bitcoin,“ stated, “the banking industry under the U.S. Federal Reserve wants nothing to do with cannabis money, because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level.” Alternate payment systems, like Paypal, also caved to federal pressure. Enter bitcoin with no need for bank accounts, or third parties and with lower fees. Enter companies, like 1620 Solutions, with the motto “Hemp Currency = Bitcoin.” More federal crackdowns are likely to drive marijuana even closer to bitcoin. If the assault merely continues to freeze dealers out of traditional payment paths, then the cryptocurrency will function and flourish openly. If the assault is more repressive, with raids and the confiscation of assets, then bitcoin use will go gray or black market. But the marijuana market will survive and become solidly crypto or cash.  The foregoing examples are unintended consequences. That is, the use of bitcoin as remittances and as a banking substitute were not intended by the new policies. They are by-products. Other Trump signals more directly address bitcoin. Consider another two examples. 1. Trump clearly intends to relax regulations on the traditional banking system. His plans include “dismantling” the Dodd-Frank Act and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, giving the financial sector more freedom in such practices as issuing loans. (Both were viewed as consumer protections in the wake of the 2008 banking crisis.) Presumably, the Durbin Amendment, which is part of Dodd-Frank, would also be repealed. The amendment limits what credit cards can charge merchants for swipe fees. Thus, the cost of receiving credit card payments would almost certainly rise for businesses, making the cost of goods and services rise for card users. Businesses would return to or increase the practice of giving discounts for cash or cash-equivalents. Customers would be incentivized to adopt cryptocurrencies. 2. The Feds and New York State are jousting about which one will lead in the regulation of bitcoin –  the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) or the NY Department of Financial Services (DFS). No one knows where the feds will land on bitcoin. The appointment of long-time bitcoin enthusiast Mick Mulvaney to head the Office of Management and Budget is encouraging but says nothing substantial. One thing is clear, however: New York State thinks it knows Trump’s intentions. A battle to ‘own’ the regulation of bitcoin issue is poised to begin, and a challenged Trump does not back down, especially when challenged in his own backyard of NY. Established in 2011, the DFS is arguably now the most aggressive bitcoin licensing agency in America. A January 17 Press Release was entitled “DFS Superintendent [Maria T.] Vullo Submits Comment Letter to OCC in Opposition of Proposed Special Purpose National Bank Charter for ‘Fintech’ Companies.” The letter vehemently opposed the OCC’s proposal to start regulating fintech:s, which would include bitcoin institutions. Vullo stated, “The OCC should not use technological advances as an excuse to attempt to usurp state laws that already regulate fintech activities.” The feds versus New York state will be a slug match for financial authority. Whether other Trump-hostile states, like California, follow suit is not clear but likely. Bitcoin could become a state’s rights issue, especially since huge revenue is involved. Whether this would be good for bitcoin is unpredictable. Whether through unintended consequences or by targeted policies, whether on the open or gray market, bitcoin will rise in value under Trump. The wild card is state’s rights. What do you think about bitcoin under the Trump administration? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-03-03T06:00:24-04:00,Single-Family Offices Are Diversifying Investments With Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/single-family-offices-diversifying-investments-bitcoin/,"According to a Family Office Association executive, family-owned investment groups are hedging their bets with the digital asset bitcoin.     Also read: Antonopoulos Details Bitcoin’s Protection Against Quantum Computing Mainstream investors are looking towards bitcoin more and more these days as a safe haven and a digital asset hedge. With an ETF decision approaching, many bitcoin proponents hope it will be approved, adding an influx of mainstream investors to the cryptocurrency economy. An interview with the founder of the Family Office Association Angelo Robles reveals that there has been a rise in single family office (SFO) investments in bitcoin. Family offices come in two categories: single-family office (SFO) or multi-family office (MFO). These types of investment groups are family-controlled, and SFOs are the predominant form of these businesses. Robles has noticed an increasing amount of SFOs that view the digital currency as a prospective asset class. “There are a number of overlapping rationales for these single-family offices to invest in bitcoins”, explains Robles. For example, there’s a fixed supply of bitcoins, more businesses are accepting the currency, and more and more investors from hedge funds to institutional players are looking at bitcoins as a way to diversify a portfolio. Also, bitcoin benefits by being first on the scene and establishing a beachhead of sorts.” Alongside this, David Berger, of the Digital Currency Council, explains why he believes single-family offices see bitcoin as a diversification option. However, Berger doesn’t think bitcoin is a great way to preserve family office wealth, as he thinks there is too much volatility. The Family Office Association (FOA) has embraced the idea of SFOs utilizing bitcoin for wealth management by releasing reports about digital currencies in its portfolio section. One particular report is written by CNBC’s Brian Kelly called “Digital Currencies Transforming Finance.” FOA members can read the research report written by Kelly, which gives an “in-depth look at digital currencies transforming finance with a focus on Bitcoin and Bitcoin 2.0.” Even though the Digital Currency Council’s David Berger sees bitcoin as risky, he’s noticed the cryptocurrency environment growing very fast. There’s no doubt SFOs are looking to bitcoin as a prospective asset class, but there are two types of investments happening, says Berger. “While a growing number of single-family offices are investing in bitcoins and other decentralized digital currencies, some are choosing to invest in companies that are building the technology and infrastructure,” Berger adds. “The ecosystem developing around this new asset class is growing very quickly.” What do you think about family offices investing in bitcoin?

2017-03-03T03:00:18-04:00,What’s the Big Deal About Bitcoin Above the Gold Price Anyway?,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/big-deal-bitcoin-above-gold-price/,"As the Bitcoin price approached parity with the gold price, the significance of the price event elicited much debate in the Bitcoin Community. While many bitcoiners take bitcoin-gold price parity as evidence of the digital currency’s continued success, some analysts suggest the event is meaningless. Related: Gold and Bitcoin Form Symbiotic Relationship “What is even a troy ounce?” Josh Crumb, Bitgold (now Goldmoney) co-founder and CSO, tells Bitcoin.com. “Is it the same unit as a bitcoin? The value is not truly at parity, as gold is still a 322 times larger market than bitcoin,” he reasons. “If some other company achieves the same share price as Apple, you don’t say it’s reached parity with Apple. You have to look at the market capitalization.”  “Comparing the bitcoin and gold price is meaningless,” he concludes. As a gold bug, analyst for gold dealer Miles Franklin, Andy Hoffman, long looked at the bitcoin price next to the gold price with a bit of longing. It had been so successful so fast.  “I remember back in May 2016, on a chart, a cup and handle formation in bitcoin had formed since the Mt. Gox crash,” the monetary expert tells Bitcoin.com “It looked like the chart for gold, but going all the way back from 1980 to 2005. So, bitcoin’s chart looked like gold, but took just three years to form, while gold took an entire 25 years to form. There are a lot of similar kinds of things going on because of technology advancing so rapidly, and fiat currencies declining so rapidly. Bitcoin’s learning curve in terms of storage value and currency has been faster.” He adds: “Gold and silver are the tortoise, and bitcoin is the hare. It’s growing so fast as a new technology. All-in-all, Bitcoin, gold and silver are fighting the same fight, and along the way bitcoin is going to take a lot of flak.”  “We do see a lot of interesting patterns whenever gold and bitcoin move independently,” BitStamp CEO Nejc Kodrič tells Bitcoin.com. “If you look at both graphs, whenever gold is rising and bitcoin is falling, we here at Bitstamp see bitcoin volume increase. People sell bitcoins to buy gold. The reason for it is, those who do this still find gold to be valuable as the oldest and the best old form of value. Gold is still the safehaven for many bitcoiners. We are seeing more and more people realizing the complementary aspects between gold and bitcoin.” Bitstamp allows clients to take physical gold delivery when selling bitcoins. Mr. Kodrič believes: “Parity is a monumental moment in time because it is happening for the first time.” Many contend the two have a symbiotic relationship, as gold banks have studied blockchain technology and how it could improve gold storage and accountability. As well, Bitcoiners have created physical silver and gold coins backed by bitcoins. Some contend that, if Bitcoin fails as a medium exchange due to scalability issues, then it could still succeed as a digital store of value – that is, a ‘digital gold.’ What do you think about gold and bitcoin?

2017-03-02T10:31:08-04:00,Bitcoin’s Rocket Boosters on Full Throttle as Price Skyrockets to New ATH,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-rocket-boosters-on-full-throttle-as-price-skyrockets-to-new-ath/,"The price of bitcoin has once again crossed another all-time high reaching an average of US$1240 across global exchanges, before climbing to new heights above $1250. Bitcoin’s value had already met parity with the price of one ounce of gold and had also beaten the December 4th, 2013 Mt. Gox ATH price of $1242. Also Read: One Bitcoin Worth More Than One Ounce of Gold for First Time Bitcoin’s incredible run up has continued to chug forward many believe the spike is due to the March 11 SEC decision for the first bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). During the morning before the new ATH, the price per BTC had consolidated in the $1235-40 range moving in a steady upward motion. If the price goes south, there is strong support around the $1180-1200 range, but nothing suggests a bearish decline at the moment. Technical indicators show sellers are keeping things interesting, giving room for intra-range and day trading techniques. At press time the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 200 SMA show a significant divide signaling the possibility of more upswings from buyers. The Relative Strength Index also shows bullish conditions may continue as momentum builds. In other countries, bitcoin price spreads are higher than the global average which shows strong demand. For instance, the South Korean bitcoin exchange Coinone shows an average of $1280 per BTC but one quick price spike brought the price to $1880 USD around 14:30 Beijing time.  A week ago bitcoin was trading at $1180 per BTC as the uptrend in value started rising steadily. The bullish trend doesn’t seem to be slowing up as it may coincide with the ETF decision that’s a little over a week away. Currently, the price is trying to test new levels that could enter into the $1250-60 range in the near future. Moreover, during the past seven days, bitcoin’s market capitalization is very close to reaching $20 billion USD. However, bitcoin’s market dominance against other cryptocurrencies has declined to a low of 84 percent as some altcoins are trading at new price highs. News has been relatively positive in regards to Bitcoin, as long as it’s not coming from China. A majority of the bitcoin community is focused on the changes taking place with Chinese bitcoin exchanges. China’s central bank has imposed quite a few new guidelines essentially dropping the country’s BTC trading volume like a rock. Alongside, Japan has taken the reigns and now begins to lead in overall global bitcoin trade volume. In other news, many headlines are paying attention to the upcoming SEC decision regarding the Coin ETF. Coin shares will, if approved, be backed by bitcoin held in reserves and enable mainstream investors to hold the non-traditional asset class in their portfolios. The recent price increase seems to be attributed to the ETF decision, and bitcoin proponents believe that if Coin is approved bitcoin’s value will go moon-bound. Meanwhile, as bitcoin breaks new levels, a few other altcoins have also been testing new highs. As said above, bitcoin’s market dominance has dropped while digital currencies like Dash and Ethereum are capturing quite a bit of capital. The biggest jump up has been demonstrated by Dash which is currently trading at $57 and holds the third highest capitalization. Alongside this, Ethereum has picked up the pace as well trading at close to $19 per Ether at press time. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash have been pushing record trading volumes surpassing $384 million USD per day. The bitcoin price could very well reach the $1300 range in the near future and possibly before the ETF decision. The SEC’s action on March 11 could effectively move the price either up or down as well. For the time being, technical indicators suggest the bull run will continue until this date, likely reaching new highs along the way.  Bear scenario: Short term support looks as though there is a solid floor in the $1180-1200 range at press time. During these highs literally anything could happen and a bearish decline could falter key trend lines.  Bull scenario: 24-hour and weekly charts suggest the bull run will continue to ride the ascending channel pattern. If things continue to progress upwards, the price per BTC could easily cross the $1300 mark over the course of the week.    Disclaimer: Bitcoin price articles are intended for informational purposes only and should not to be considered as trading advice.

2017-03-02T08:30:39-04:00,One Bitcoin Worth More Than One Ounce of Gold for First Time,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-worth-one-ounce-gold/,"One bitcoin has now, at least briefly, been worth more than one ounce of gold, hitting $1239.9 at the bitcoin exchange Bitstamp, while an ounce of gold was priced at $1238.67. The last time a single bitcoin might have been worth more than an ounce of gold happened in November 2013, more than three years ago. Having taken place based on Mt. Gox pricing models, possibly manipulated due to internal Mt. Gox trading bot(s), the legitimacy of bitcoin’s first dance with gold parity faces continued scrutiny. Regardless, the price of gold in bitcoin terms is now trading at an all-time low. Also Read: Brexit and Bitcoin and Gold, Oh My! When, according to Mt. Gox, the bitcoin price exceeded that of an ounce of gold, it had just broken through the $1,000 threshold. Similarly, the bitcoin price crossed the $1,000 mark January 1 before gold-bitcoin parity in the first week of January 2017. In April 2011, bitcoin realized parity with the US dollar. It later reached parity with silver (so nicknamed the “devil’s metal” for its ties to populism) at approximately $29.65 per bitcoin on February 19, 2013. Bitcoin, long called ‘digital gold’ due to its strict coin creation protocol involving a computational process dubbed ‘mining,’ performed as a better safehaven, perhaps, than gold bullion. Gold demand stoked by Negative Interest Rate Policies (NIRP) in Japan led to stalwart demand for the ‘yellow metal’ by July 2017. Gold fell nearly 20% for the remainder of the year.  Bitcoin increased more than 125% over the course of 2016. Fiat crises throughout 2016 in emerging or underdeveloped markets like India, China, Venezuela, and Greece is perceived to have benefited bitcoin more than gold. In “An Analysis of Bitcoin Exchange Rates,” economist Jacob Smith, who calls bitcoin a “digital counterpart” of gold,  “highlights the similarities between the traditional commodity and its new digital counterpart.” He writes: The bitcoin and gold markets have long been intertwined. One of the most popular companies early in bitcoin’s existence, Casascius, produced the most expensive physical bitcoin ever produced, one of which sold for $1,000,000 in 2013. Comprised of one ounce of fine gold (which was worth about one-third the value of 1,000 BTC when produced), Casascius offered the coins at $5,500. An owner of one such rare coin recently used bitcoin’s price rise as an opportunity to share the rarity on Reddit. The redditor explained how it worked: “I have a confirmation code that proves that my passphrase unlocks an encrypted private key that maps to the bitcoin address on the coin,” the coin holder wrote. “If I ever sell these coins, I will give the passphrase and confirmation code to the buyer. So the only trust is that Mike Caldwell didn’t screw up and not put the correct encrypted private key under the hologram. So far, Mike’s work has been top notch. But of course, would you trust it with $1M if you have that kind of money? That is for you to decide. Do note that I have not funded these with any BTC.”  At gold-bitcoin parity, the bitcoin market cap ($18 billion) expressed as a percent of gold in circulation ($7 trillion) is currently at about 0.388%. Bitcoiners see this as evidence of bitcoin’s room for growth. The last time bitcoin approximated the gold price, however, it marked the top of the bull run in 2013 for the digital currency. UPDATE: Bitcoin’s exchange rate vs. the US dollar subsided to $1236 and below, shortly after beating the per ounce gold price (keep an eye on the price here). Are you a gold and bitcoin investor?

2017-03-02T04:00:51-04:00,Don’t Miss the Fine Print on That Bitcoin ETF,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/dont-miss-the-fine-print-on-that-bitcoin-etf/,"The hyped decision by the SEC about a Bitcoin ETF could either make bitcoin available on mainstream trading and investment platforms for Middle America…or not.   This would mean mainstream investment platforms offer bitcoin as a US-regulated stock. “This will make the price go to mars,” says a Bitcoiner on Reddit. Indeed, a potential Bitcoin ETF has been credited with the bitcoin price rise in recent months. But not everyone is convinced the ETF will be approved. Related: Needham´s Insights Into Factors Affecting SEC Bitcoin ETF Decision 
The SEC has until March 11 to approve the ETF. The Coin exchange-traded fund filed its first S-1 for the trust in 2013, when bitcoin increased to its then all-time high. According to Google Trends, excitement for the ETF is at fever pitch.  The Bitcoin ETF Coin is modeled after the fund on the SPDR Gold Trust ETF, where the fund buys and holds physical gold to back shares. Coin shares represent 1/100 of a bitcoin and the Bitcoin Trust plans to offer 10,000,000 shares at $10 each. Many expect the ETF could lead to a bitcoin price rally. “Combining ETFs and bitcoin is likely to be consequential. After all, ETFs have been revolutionizing investments for 25 years, and bitcoin, since its 2009 introduction, has shown potential to completely change financial transactions,” writes Mike Venuto for ETF.com. “In an age where asset allocation is its own asset class, a bitcoin ETF could have a place in many portfolios.” Not everyone is happy about the investment product.  “It will help centralize a big, big part of ‘Bitcoin’ capital by making some ppl take care of your private keys,” comments a redditor on the popular social media website, “making it vulnerable to all kinds of attacks that would not exist if it was used the way it was intended: without the need for third parties.” Another adds: “ETF is really only hot air that will result in nothing but higher fees (in USD$). And that is the best case that can come out of it.”  The action led some to speculate the likelihood of approval had increased. Much discussed, a recent amendment included a so-called “hard fork” clause. “In the event, a developer or group of developers proposes a modification to the Bitcoin Network that is not accepted by a majority of miners and users, but that is nonetheless accepted by a substantial plurality of miners and users, two or more competing and incompatible Blockchain implementations could result,” reads the filing. “This is known as a ‘hard fork.’ In such a case, the ‘hard fork’ in the Blockchain could materially and adversely affect the perceived value of bitcoin as reflected on one or both incompatible Blockchains, and thus the value of the Trust’s bitcoin.” Hard forks represent a reconfiguration of bitcoin protocol rules. If not everyone adopts the new implementation, Bitcoin could split into two groups, as happened when Ethereum hard-forked and Ethereum Classic came about. The Ethereum blockchain had split. If this happens, Coin would side with the chain which enjoys “the greatest cumulative computation difficulty for the forty-eight (48) hour period following a given hard fork.” In another scenario: “If the Custodian, in consultation with the Sponsor, is unable to make a conclusive determination about which Bitcoin Network has the greatest cumulative computational difficulty after forty-eight (48) hours, or determines in good faith that this is not a reasonable criterion upon which to make a determination, the Custodian will support the Bitcoin Network which it deems in good faith is most likely to be supported by a greater number of users and miners.” In short, Coin defaults to the chain with the most hashing power, but reserves the right to decide otherwise. Recent updates to the Bitcoin ETF SEC filing also include mentions of recent actions in China relating to the Bitcoin space. “In January 2017, the People’s Bank of China announced that it had found several violations, including margin financing and a failure to impose anti-money laundering controls, after on-site inspections of two China-based Bitcoin Exchanges,” states the filing. “In response to the Chinese regulator’s oversight, the three largest China-based Bitcoin Exchanges, OKCoin, Huobi, and BTC China, started charging trading commission fees to suppress speculative trading and prevent price swings which resulted in a significant drop in volume on these exchanges.” Associations with darknet marketplaces might not help its case, either – at least, it could undermine the ETF’s ability to attract investors from Middle America. To allay regulator concerns, SolidX, for their part, has proposed a project to insure against theft for bitcoin, which would include bitcoin-backed products. In 2017, the bitcoin price has surged to all-time highs. What do you think the future will be for Bitcoin in a world with a Bitcoin ETF? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-03-02T03:10:01-04:00,How the Hyped Lumino Whitepaper Details Protocol for Scaling Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/lumino-whitepaper-details-protocol-scaling-bitcoin/,"Rootstock’s Chief Scientist, Sergio Demian Lerner, has been hinting about a new Bitcoin scaling solution called Lumino for over a month. Lumino’s whitepaper has finally surfaced, introducing the Lumino Transaction Compression Protocol (LTCP). Also read: Bitcoin Upgrade Lumino Introduces a New Approach to Scalability  Similar to a new envisioning of the Lightning Network, Lumino is a new type of off-chain payment channel network that plans to use compressed transactional data in Bitcoin’s blocks. Lerner describes Lumino as a new and important part of RSK‘s main platform, which is still primarily a decentralized Bitcoin sidechain, capable of an even larger amount of bitcoin transactions per second than Lumino alone. The paper introduces a new protocol, the LTCP, which “forms the transaction layer to the Lumino network”, Lerner explains. Its purpose is to create far smaller bitcoin transactions, so as many as 100 can be processed by the network every second, which is an improvement of between 6 to 33 times today’s transaction limits. The extension of the RSK platform was designed for “blockchains with fast block rates and account based ledgers”, including Bitcoin, but modeled after Ethereum. Lumino bridges the gap between Bitcoin and Ethereum to take advantage of the scaling benefits from the latter into Bitcoin’s blocks. Lerner describes Lumino as “a technique for transaction compression that allows processing a higher volume of transactions but storing much less information”, adding that: The lion’s share of the scaling growth comes from the compression of particular data in each transaction, while using the rest of the data as a template, which does not always need to be saved. “The critical insight behind Lumino compression is delta compression of selected fields,” Lerner wrote, “from a previous referenced transaction and the aggregate signing of previous transactions, so previous signatures can be disposed”. If Lerner is correct, Lumino’s restructuring improvements could allow the Bitcoin network to reach 100 transactions per second (tps) “or even more, depending on the usage pattern,” he claims. “The LTCP protocol could enable the Lumino network to reach one billion active users”, he further notes. Also, once implemented, the gains should happen very quickly, without everyone upgrading and without risking a hard fork to Bitcoin’s code. After some analysis, Lerner admits that predicting the number of active users that the Lumino network can handle is not easy, but he estimates: This estimate is on top of any other scaling solution’s benefits such as Segwit or the Lighting Network, although it has yet to be seen if Lumino and another lightning network can work together without conflicts. After Lumino has been fully deployed, RSK’s plan for the rest of their sidechain-based product takes the network much further, in the realm of “2000 on-chain tps”, he wrote. The largest drawback to the Lumino system may be transaction privacy. “Transaction compression means data reuse,” Lerner admits, “which means that Lumino higher compression is a tradeoff for lower privacy”. Small bits of reused data could theoretically link payments together for a user, he explains, although it is doubtful that a link between any payment and a user’s real name exist. At any rate, “the tradeoff choice is left to individual users”, he notes. How much tradeoff depends on usage, Lerner further clarifies. “The LTCP protocol enables storage-compression but has resource bottlenecks: bandwidth usage and, to a lower extent, CPU usage”, he adds. Another tradeoff is the use of Bitcoin’s OP_RETURN field. “To extend Bitcoins header with the fields required by Lumino”, Lerner wrote, “the fields can be stored in an OP_RETURN output of the coinbase transaction”. The controversial 80-byte field available in every Bitcoin transaction is popular with many companies and applications such as blockchain timestamping services including Factom, Blocksign, Blockstore, Stampery, and several others. If Lumino becomes part of Bitcoin, then these services may not be able to take advantage of the upgrades without re-writing their platforms to use some other method. Like many projects nowadays, Lerner came to the conclusion that Lumino should be introduced to Bitcoin as a Soft fork, which is backwards-compatible and does not require everyone to upgrade to it in order for it to work. His paper describes what it would take to implement Lumino into Bitcoin this way. “We need to create an account address space for a sidechain embedded in the Bitcoin block, as an extension block”, he conveys. The Bitcoin nodes that do so will be able to process Lumino transactions immediately, which he believes would drastically cut down on the amount of space each transaction in a block takes up, making them as small as 8 bytes. Interestingly, Lumino planned as a soft fork upgrade to Bitcoin “does not benefit from Segwit space savings, since Lumino exodus address is an anyone-can-spend output, the transaction that consumes this output specifies an empty script”, Lerner notes.

2017-03-01T19:00:34-04:00,Veriphant Helps Enable Legal Proofs in the Bitcoin Blockchain,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/veriphant-helps-enable-legal-proofs-in-the-bitcoin-blockchain/,"Data immutability service Veriphant uses the Bitcoin blockchain and other methods to ensure their customers’ data is completely immutable and even legal in a court of law. Bitcoin.com talked to founder Charles Fairclough about his recently-launched service. Also Read: Comparison: 3 Platforms Paying You in Bitcoin for Uploading Images  How the business world notarizes and timestamps their data has been undergoing a major change since Bitcoin came along and gave them a cheaper alternative that holds digital documents immutably. However, most courts and legal processes worldwide have not changed to accommodate this new technology. UK startup Veriphant recognized the need to offer this new type of proof, including cryptographic fingerprinting of the data and even submitting those to newspapers, which the courts already do recognize as proof. The company aims to follow accepted legal standards while providing immutability for documents and other business using the powerful method of timestamping data to Bitcoin’s blockchain. Registration on the Veriphant website is currently restricted to those with invites. However, Fairclough confirmed to Bitcoin.com that: “Veriphant has launched and is indeed active”. The startup is currently working with organizations to implement its technology. “We will have open registration soon, allowing anyone to signup and start using our platform”, he said. In order to make their client’s data legally binding in more legal systems, the startup has created “three main legal tie-ins,” according to Fairclough. “The first is using the Bitcoin Blockchain as a legal proof of existence”, he explained, however, so far there has been no use of a blockchain in a legal case “as far as we are aware”, he admitted. The second uses “peer-to-peer technology to store fingerprints of data sets”, a type of cryptographic proof that is more commonly used in court cases. The third tie-in uses a novel method of submitting those finger-print data sets to “nationally printed newspapers, to have the fingerprint published.” This way of locking in data, Fairclough explained, makes Veriphant “the first in the world to use this methodology,” he claims. The founder has already applied for a patent for the method, which is “being processed at this very moment.” “Our main product is a custom addition only database, which would be tailored to your needs”, Fairclough explained. To that end, the startup offers an API and three multi-platform tools to its customers. According to Fairclough, Veriphant can preserve any kind of data. “Anything from plain-text, to fully encrypted and signed data”, he said, including “pictures, music, documents, application data, website data etc”. The size of the data is only “limited by normal restrictions involved with storing large data, such as storage and hosting costs”, he noted. There are currently three tools listed on the website. The first, called the Document Manager, is a multi-platform application that facilitates the storage and management of any document format. This tool “handles legal documents and historically records all version changes making all the data easily auditable and immutable”, Fairclough described, adding that it “eliminates lost documents, reduces audit costs, prevents data tampering and is completely verifiable”. The second is called Veriphant Data Integrity. “This tool protects your business data by irreversibly locking it in place, so it cannot be tampered with. All data modifications, or insertions are recorded and linked to a person within your organisation”, Fairclough noted. The third is Veriphant Data Share, which is “a mobile, web and desktop application for securely sharing sensitive immutable data between individuals, organisations and/or systems”, the website describes. There are other timestamping services in the crypto space. “We are very similar to services like Tierion and Factom”, Fairclough noted. Tierion calls itself “the first cloud platform capable of recording millions of records in the Bitcoin blockchain.” While the company’s ability to make all kinds of data immutable is facilitated by integration into over 500 applications, its emphasis is not on legal proofs, as Veriphant is attempting. Factom, meanwhile, is a much larger suite with products for many different industries from insurance to real estate. One of their older products, Harmony, uses document timestamping technology with existing imaging and document management solutions aimed at loan documents. However, Fairclough believes that Veriphant sets itself apart from competitors because “we offer additional verification methods and we also have lots of unique tools and services”. In addition, he claims that Veriphant makes things “extremely simple and easy to start creating Blockchain applications – with our easy to use API”. “Our pricing is very dependent on the level of implementation required and whether they opt for all our verification methods”, Fairclough described, citing “peer-to-peer, cryptocurrency ledger injection (using Bitcoin) and now we are also making use of nationally printed newspapers to provably lock in data”. The company accepts bitcoin as well as traditional currencies. “Our lowest price will start from just $12.50 per month,” he said, adding that there will be a wide range of package and pricing options.

2017-03-01T06:00:02-04:00,Gold Bug Peter Schiff Calls Bitcoin ‘Digital Fool’s Gold’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-schiff-bitcoin-digital-fools-gold/,"This week CNBC broadcast a debate between financial markets commentator Brian Kelly, and gold proponent and economist Peter Schiff on the show “Fast Money.” The two finance experts discussed which was a better investment — Bitcoin or gold? Bitcoin has been a contentious issue for gold bugs since the cryptocurrency was created. Over the past few years, economist Peter Schiff has expressed his opinion that bitcoin has no real value. Schiff’s debate with Brian Kelly is no different as he still believes bitcoins are no more valuable than “beanie babies.” However, CNBC’s Brian Kelly disagrees and thinks bitcoin’s value revolves around its usefulness spurring global demand. The human subjective valuations of gold as a “shiny rock” is the same as bitcoin’s, states Kelly. Also read: Antonopoulos Details Bitcoin’s Protection Against Quantum Computing On Fast Money the financial markets news team discussed in detail the benefits of bitcoin investments compared to gold. “What is the better bet going forward gold or bitcoin?” the host of the show asked; “Well for me obviously it’s Bitcoin,” explains the author and investor Brian Kelly. “Bitcoin is not just digital gold. I think that’s what a lot of people get wrong here. It’s a technology platform that fintech is being built on top of — It is a once in a generation investment opportunity similar to the internet, growing just as fast if not faster. It’s the internet of money. I’m not alone on this. Everybody’s involved in it — the Federal Reserve just released a paper on it and has a working group. Bank of England is involved in it, fourteen of the top thirty banks have active projects going on. JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, CME, and NYSE are all involved in projects as we speak building on top of this technology.” As usual, the gold bug in Schiff remains unfazed by the comments of bitcoin supporters. In fact, during the debate, Schiff calls Brian Kelly a member of a “cult” who is obsessed with the digital currency.  “Well it’s not digital gold I agree,” details Schiff’s rebuttal. “It’s digital ‘fools gold’. You know today’s bitcoins are like beanie babies. The whole principle behind bitcoin was to replicate the properties that made gold uniquely suited to be money and act as an alternative to fiat currencies. But it’s not really viable as a money — I mean it is a potential medium of exchange, but it’s not a store of value. Meanwhile, nobody really uses it as a medium of exchange it’s just a speculative asset. People own it because they think it’s going to be more valuable in the future but it has no intrinsic value.” Brian Kelly quickly interjects stating, “150,000 merchants worldwide accept bitcoin, including Expedia. [Bitcoin] has 300,000 transactions a day.” However, Schiff disagrees that merchants actually accept the digital currency. Schiff believes this is a “gimmick” and these companies who accept bitcoin are actually accepting dollars or euros. “No, no. No merchants accept bitcoin,” explains Schiff. “They work with a company called Bitpay. They accept dollars. There are no merchants that price their merchandise in bitcoin. It’s impossible. It’s a gimmick to try and pretend.” Kelly counters arguing that bitcoin has the same usefulness that gold has. “Bitcoin has the exact same value as gold has,” Kelly shouts above Schiff’s commentary. “It has the same exact value as gold has… Gold is just a rock. It doesn’t have any special values. It’s just a shiny rock.”  Schiff responds: “There is no limit to the number of digital currencies that can be created. There are hundreds of others. Why doesn’t anyone use Myspace? Because somebody came up with Facebook.”  The latest Fast Money debate on CNBC shows once again Schiff will not give bitcoin a chance as an investment, especially when compared to gold. Schiff has appeared many times on CNBC stating that bitcoin is basically worthless in his eyes. During the bitcoin price rise in 2013, Schiff said bitcoin was in a bubble and is similar to a “modern-day tulip mania.”  Notably, Schiff’s precious metals company has been accepting bitcoin for gold purchases since 2014. What do you think about the debate between Brian Kelly and Peter Schiff? Do you think Schiff’s arguments against bitcoin are valid?

2017-03-01T03:00:24-04:00,Cypherpunk Steve Schear: ‘Bitcoin Is a Viable Alternative to National Money’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/cypherpunk-steve-schear-bitcoin/,"It has been said many times: the decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin was born from the libertarian ideals of the cypherpunk movement. Just recently Bitcoin.com chatted with cypherpunk Steve Schear, interim Chief Operating Officer at Stash Crypto, to discuss the history of this movement and the emerging technologies pushing it forward.  Cypherpunks are activists who advocate the use of cryptographic technology to promote freedom and uproot social and political change. The movement began in the late 1980s as many activists communicated through the cypherpunks’ electronic mailing list. Schear gives our readers a glimpse into the early days of the cypherpunks, the birth of Bitcoin, and how he sees the cypherpunk movement evolving today. Also read: How One of the Original Cypherpunks Recalls Bitcoin’s Inception Bitcoin.com (BC): How did you first get involved with the cypherpunk movement?  Steve Schear (SS): In the early 1990s a workmate showed me an issue of Mondo 2000, the precursor of Wired magazine, edited by Jude Milhon (who coined the term “cypherpunk”). It opened up my world to cyber- and cypherpunk. A few years passed, and through a variety of coincidences, I found the cypherpunks list. My first physical meeting was at Eric Hughes’ home in Berkeley where I met some of the key Bay Area cypherpunks, including Jude and Tim May. BC: When did you first discover Bitcoin? SS: While in aerospace and later at Cylink, I became familiar with data security and cryptography. It was then, in the mid-1990s, I started thinking about commercializing some declassified military tech for secure communications and cash-like digital money. Around the same time I connected up with the cypherpunks, I was introduced to Jon Matonis. We stayed in regular touch discussing political and tech topics. I knew of Bitcoin from lurking on Perry Metzger’s cryptography list, but had not heard it progressed from Satoshi’s specification to working code. Jon said he was moving his focus to Bitcoin and suggested I do likewise. I wish I had immediately followed his advice, but I was busy with a new job. It wasn’t until more than a year later I got serious about Bitcoin. BC: After thirty years how do you see the cypherpunk movement today? SS: I think it’s matured and much of it has become mainstream wisdom. Our early rants about government false-flags and intel agency monitoring are no longer considered tin-foil-hat delusions. Wikileaks, the alt-media and Snowden’s cache of documents have seen to that. BC: There seems to be more people just coding rather than being very vocal, like cypherpunks such as Eric Hughes and Timothy C. May. Why do you think cypherpunks today are less vocal? SS: Many early cypherpunks focused on identifying and understanding the social nature of privacy problems. They’ve already spent enough energy pontificating and now focus on implementing. BC: Do you think some of the original cypherpunks have gone into hiding due to threats from government?   SS: Very few. If you look at the noteworthy cypherpunks, it’s clear many are still heavily involved in this tech. BC: Do you think Bitcoin is the counter-economic digital currency that will help promote economic freedom in the future? SS: Bitcoin is already a viable alternative to national money and regulated banking in countries with weak central banks, abusive monetary policies or poor economic conditions.   BC: What other types of technologies do you see advancing to improve people’s freedoms? SS: Covert communications: Building on the ideas of Richard Feynman and Eric Drexler, Neil Stephenson’s prescient Diamond Age presents a future in which almost any inert item can be manufactured in the home using “matter compilers,” a super-empowered form of 3D-printing and precursor to Star Trek replicators. Between covert communications for networking, DIY biology, Sonny and matter, an agoric reversal of dependence could very well occur and with it a decline of nationalism and a resurgence of individualism. BC: Do you think the original goals (privacy, freedom of speech, economic sovereignty) of the cypherpunk movement will be achieved? SS: I am hopeful, at least for those that care enough to fight for it and change their behaviors. ‘Those who surrender freedom for security will not have, nor do they deserve, either one,’ as Ben Franklin said.  What do you think about the cypherpunk movement?

2017-02-28T19:00:09-04:00,Here’s (Most of) What Has Happened to Bitcoin in China So Far in 2017,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/happened-to-bitcoin-in-china-2017/,"2017 for bitcoin has already been dizzying. The price broke $1,000 on January 1 and, last week, it broke through an all-time high. The price gains have come as a flurry of events in China, where the digital currency is defined as a ‘virtual good’, have left the Bitcoin scene there in disarray.  Related: The Butterfly Effect of Bitcoin’s Exchange Regulations  On January 5, the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) spoke with bitcoin exchanges informing them that bitcoin is still not a currency under Chinese laws. Rumors abounded that China would soon act to ban Bitcoin, a nation where the majority of the digital currency is generated via its mining process. A milder interpretation of the action surmised the central bank was simply clarifying the nation’s laws – no offline promotion, no fake trades, devaluation of the yuan can’t be mentioned to promote digital currency, and they reiterated mandatory know your customer and anti-money laundering laws, among other conditions. PBoC also took this opportunity to warn investors about the digital currency’s volatility and risk. On January 11, People’s Daily, China’s official paper, published a story on blockchain technology which included a graphic explaining Bitcoin. The PBoC Shanghai and the Shanghai Municipal Finance Office were already inspecting popular Bitcoin service provider and exchange, BTCC. The two authorities then inspected bitcoin exchanges Huobi and OKcoin. The latter stated in a customer service email: “[Authorities] are conducting a one-week long inspection, only to understand the situation here. The purpose is to maintain financial stability, prevent financial risks, and regulate market trading behavior”, the Chinese exchange wrote. “No other intentions. The deposit and withdraw services are functioning properly”. BTCC shared similar sentiments. “All good, just inspections”, the exchange tweeted. “A group of regulators consisting of the [Shanghai] branch of PBOC, the [Shanghai] Financial Affairs office & other related govt agencies visited BTCC”. Among other things, the Chinese exchanges would have to cease zero-fee margins trading in bitcoin. In the Bitcoin Community, a discussion concerning a large percentage of the trades in China were being faked by exchanges increased during these events. BTCC then suspended its bitcoin margin loan service. Huobi and OKCoin also suspended margin trading. On January 20, BTCC tweeted that it was “reviewing the operating experience of foreign counterparts and the charging of transaction fees, aiming to further curb speculation and prevent violent price fluctuation”. OKCoin announced it was taking similar actions. BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin introduced fees on or around January 24. A fourth Chinese bitcoin exchange, Yunbi, introduced fees shortly thereafter. “PBoC Department of Business Management, Beijing Municipal Bureau of Finance, Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce and other relevant departments formed a joint group to enter Huobi, OKCoin and other bitcoin exchanges for an on-site inspection”, the statement reads. “According to problems found during the initial inspection, the group decided to continue the inspection mainly focusing on payment settlement, anti-money laundering, foreign currency management, information and financial security. The inspection group suggests that investors should pay attention to important aspects of bitcoin exchanges, such as legal compliance, market volatility, financial security and other risks, and participation in bitcoin investment with discretion”. As the Lunar New Year approached in China, the PBoC announced it would start its own digital currency research institute to research blockchain technology. PBoC then invited nine Chinese bitcoin exchanges to a closed door meeting, including CHBTC, BTCTrade, HaoBTC and Yunbi, to reportedly emphasize no margin trading and that the exchanges must comply with AML laws. PBoC, sometimes called “Central Mom” in China, had elicited a response. OKCoin, Huobi and BTCC all announced the day after the meeting that they wound strengthen AML and KYC procedures. China-based Bitcoin twitter account and news source, CnLedger, tweeted the following day: “BTCC, OKCoin, Huobi: will upgrade AML system according to laws & regulations, pausing BTC LTC withdraw during the upgrade. Estimated time: 1 month”. On February 13, Bitcoin service provider HaoBTC announced it would cease bitcoin exchange services but maintain others like its wallet service.  Localbitcoins, a peer-to-peer bitcoin trading platform, showed an explosion in interest following the PBoC actions and subsequent suspension of withdrawals on Chinese exchanges.  On February 8, Samson Mow, CEO of BTCC, left the company he helped to found. Little explanation was given. “We are sorry to inform you that our COO [Samson Mow] is leaving BTCChina”, wrote co-founder Bobby Lee. Trading volumes by then had started to dwindle. OKCoin, which held the largest amount of bitcoin futures, saw its volume drop by more than 20,000 bitcoins from February 16-17. In the latter half of January, it became public that the PBoC was researching how to implement its own digital currency, RMBCoin, “to truly achieve the goal of money for the people”. “Now it’s becoming clear that China’s central bank will be one of the first to issue a digital currency”, according to Andy Mukherjee, writing for Bloomberg. Bloomberg added: “An initial version of bityuan will probably be a tame affair. Research at the People’s Bank of China favors a system where the monetary authority would issue the cryptocurrency to banks, which would supply it to their customers”.

2017-02-28T12:00:34-04:00,Comparison: 3 Platforms Paying You in Bitcoin for Uploading Images,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/three-platforms-paying-you-bitcoin-for-uploading-images/,"Recently, three different startups have begun offering a way for anyone to earn bitcoin by uploading content such as images and videos. Bitcoin.com examines the differences between the three platforms. Also read: New Image Hosting Service Pays Thousands of Uploaders in Bitcoin  Loopnroll allows users to publish photos, short videos and animated gifs along with music that plays while viewing. For each view that a post gets, a small amount of bitcoin is earned by its poster. “Our site is about one year old, but the BTC feature is just a few days old”, the Loopnroll team told Bitcoin.com, adding that “There are about 10,000 posts on the site”. According to the website, the company shares “about 50% of our profit” with users, and previous day’s earnings are automatically sent daily to users’ bitcoin wallets with no minimum payout. “Your earnings will primarily depend on: number of views and geo-location of viewers”, the website says. “A view from Sweden is worth a few times more than a view from Somalia”, the team clarified. Of the three platforms, Loopnroll’s interface looks the most like Imgur, the world’s most popular such website.  File Army launched its website in January, and an Android app shortly thereafter. Users upload images and earn money when their posts are viewed, liked, and also when someone follows their account. Occasionally, bonus money is offered from various activities such as “logging in, opening newsletters and more”, the site says, adding that they are working on “introducing pay-to-moderate soon”. Users are paid daily without any minimum payout size. Currently, JPG/JPEG, GIF, PNG and BMP are the supported file formats. The service has a unique pay scale based on the amount and quality of traffic which “is graded over time”, according to the site’s FAQ page. The scale potentially allows the service to pay power users more than its competitors because “Users producing high-quality traffic can earn higher rates”, the startup explained. In File Army’s payout structure, there are overall 9 grades of pay. A new user starts off at the rank of Corporal and gets promoted or demoted depending on the quality of their traffic. Corporals earn $1 per 4,000 views, $1 per 100 likes and $1 per 50 followers. However, Corporals have a cap of $2 per day. Meanwhile, the maximum one can earn is $1 per 750 views, $1 per 50 likes, and $1 per 5 followers. This level is referred to as the ‘Emperor’ and has a daily cap of $5,000. One drawback to this system is that earnings received must be received in File Army’s official bitcoin wallet called Bitcoinwallet.com. This web-based service is another project by File Army’s founder Price Givens, who has also created Fiatleak.com and a few other online businesses. File Army’s platform has a white background, and instead of the familiar side menu, visitors have to swipe left or right to view more posts.  The service that has been paying bitcoin for uploaded images the longest is Supload, which describes itself as “free image hosting that splits the profits with you from advertising”. Bitcoin.com has already profiled Supload back in December. The service also looks similar to Imgur with a few slight differences, and allows users to upload images and videos. Currently, jpg, png, webp, gif are supported file types for images and mp/4, webm, mov, avi, and gif are supported for videos, which must be restricted to 30 seconds. The site pays 50% of its profits generated from ads displayed on its website and the minimum payout is $1, which can be withdrawn at any time.  Which of the three platforms do you prefer?

2017-02-28T08:00:29-04:00,R3 Makes a Habit of Sending Cease-and-Desist Letters to Bitcoiners,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/r3-makes-a-habit-of-sending-cease-and-desist-letters-to-bitcoiners/,"R3 is making a habit of sending cease-and-desist letters to bitcoin journalists and developers. R3 first gained notoriety for bringing together 70 of the world’s largest financial institutions under the banner of ‘blockchain’, but has since moved away from the buzzword, towards so called ‘distributed ledger’ technology.  The blockchain consortium, whose primary goal is to cut costs for the back office processes at major banks, seems to have no problem lobbying legal threats at members of the Bitcoin Community who do not follow the consortium’s line. Related: R3CEV Unveils ‘Corda’, But is not Building a Blockchain Peter Todd, a longtime Bitcoin Core developer, received legal threats lobbied by R3. “R3’s allergic to criticism,” tweeted Bitcoin developer Peter Todd, who has worked with R3CEV. “Sent me a cease and desist for suggesting that there might be prior art on their patent.”  Prior art implies that Corda, which R3 seeks to patent, is already known technology, and thus ineligible for a patent. Mr. Todd says much of his work for R3CEV has gone unpaid. His work on Proofchains, which led to Corda’s design, was licensed by R3, but the consortium never paid for it. “R3 bought a commercial license to my Proofchains work, although you’d have to ask a lawyer to know if that license is valid,” Mr. Todd tweeted. Mr. Todd is not the only Bitcoin participant to receive a cease-and-desist letter. Bitcoin.com obtained a copy of an e-mail sent to a Bitcoin journalist by Chatsworth Communications, R3’s marketing firm. In regards to a story about Wells Fargo, in which the multinational’s link to R3 was mentioned, Nick Murray Leslie, CEO of Chatsworth Communications, messaged the journalist the following: “My client, R3 notes and asks me to advise you that there is no causal link whatsoever between the issue Wells Fargo is experiencing and their link to R3, which justifies your use of their name in this piece to the exclusion of any of the bank’s other partners or vendors,” Mr. Leslie writes. “As your piece does not reference any of the other block chain consortia to which Wells Fargo is also linked, this is clearly unbalanced, this may constitute malice under the Defamation Act. Wells Fargo has hundreds of partners and vendors, so we are at a loss as to why you are headlining a piece about them with a link to R3. We would ask you to remove the reference to R3 both in the headline and the body copy as it is irrelevant in the context of your piece immediately.” He added: “R3 is a consortium working on whether distributed ledger technology can be applied to financial services. It is not bitcoin as is widely known. I am more than happy to advise you again as perhaps the point was not as clear as you need. The content and presentation of your article willfully conflates and combines the repetitional issues affecting Wells Fargo with its being a member of the R3 consortium, when there is no causal link or relevance in linking the two. As your article does not make the link with any other vendors, this could constitute a defamation under UK law.” The editor at the bitcoin news website in question gave into R3’s demands. Just recently, Bitcoin online news source, The Merkle, also received a cease-and-desist. “The article published yesterday on your site yesterday on our client R3 is factually inaccurate, misleading and libelous,” writes Nick Warren of Chatsworth Communication, to the Merkle. R3 was prompted by a sensationalist headline, “R3 Admits Defeat, Stops Blockchain Development.” Mr. Warren asks: “Please take this article down from your website immediately.” Charley Cooper, Managing Director of R3, then chimes in: “We’ve been flattered by all the attention this past week. Too bad the story isn’t a story. We’ve said from the beginning that while Corda is a distributed ledger platform, it is not a traditional blockchain platform and was never designed to be one.” Today, R3 seemingly strays away from the word ‘blockchain,’ despite its initial market splash, when the word appeared in various articles from mainstream sources describing the organization as a blockchain consortium. Reuters, for instance, ran the headline, “R3 Blockchain group adds five banks, brings in technology heavyweights.” R3CEV is based in New York. Freedom of the press is among the crowning achievements of the American Revolution. What is and is not libel or slander is difficult to decipher. Whereas in the past it has been an open question as to whether online content creators are protected by media shield laws. But, they are protected by the Free Speech Clause, which is supported by the U.S. Supreme Court Still, it is up for debate whether or not R3CEV has been a victim of libel, and thus retains the right to issue cease-and-desist letters. At press, David Rutter, R3CEV CEO and founder, had yet to reply to inquiries regarding these actions. Does R3CEV have a defamation case against certain Bitcoin organizations and participants?

This is because the Hawaii Division of Financial Institutions (DFI) has imposed regulatory policies that would make Coinbase’s continued operations there impractical. Also read: IRS Asks to Postpone Upcoming Hearing With Coinbase  According to Coinbase’s announcement, “the Hawaii DFI will require licensure of entities which offer certain virtual currency services to Hawaii residents”. Coinbase currently holds money transmitter licenses in 38 U.S. jurisdictions and submitted “a comprehensive application for licensure in Hawaii way back in 2014”, according to Juan Suarez, the head of Legal at Coinbase. While Coinbase has no objection to the licensing policy decision, the company wrote: This policy “would set Hawaii apart from nearly every other state in America and will make it impossible for Coinbase to operate there”, Suarez expressed, adding that “cash reserves (or similar, liquid assets referred to as ‘permissible investments’)” need to be maintained by Coinbase and other digital currency businesses. For example, if Coinbase holds one bitcoin for a customer in Hawaii, this new policy will require the company to also hold the equivalent cash value of that bitcoin “as redundant collateral”, he described. “This policy is obviously untenable. No digital currency business — and frankly, no commercially viable business anywhere — has the capital to supplement every customer’s bitcoin with redundant dollar collateral”, he further noted. The ‘permissible investments‘ which Suarez referred to is a standard money transmitter licensing requirement for most U.S. states. According to attorney Laurie Rosini of Perkins Coie: “Most states require digital currency companies to hold capital reserves in dollar-denominated ‘permissible investments,’ regardless of whether the company also holds digital currency value in the same form and volume as it is received”. She added that this has resulted in “added burdens on digital currency companies without enhancing consumer protections”. Some states, however, have waived the requirement and some have begun to propose rule changes to include digital currency businesses. Hawaii, on the other hand, has decided to impose this rule. Washington State, for example, introduced House Bill 1045 in December proposing amendments to the Washington Uniform Money Services Act including adding a definition of “virtual currency”. The bill proposes that “in lieu of holding traditional ‘permissible investments’, digital currency companies must hold capital reserves in ‘like-kind virtual currencies of the same volume’ as that which is obligated to consumers”, Rosini explained. Coinbase now requires all Hawaii-resident customers to close their accounts within the next thirty days, Suarez wrote, adding that “We will implement controls to prevent Hawaii residents from establishing Coinbase accounts for the indefinite future”. In addition, he advised customers wanting to hold onto their bitcoin to send them to another wallet service. However, “we cannot recommend any service which meets Coinbase’s security standards and which is licensed to operate in Hawaii”, he claims. While exiting the Hawaiian market for the time being, Coinbase still hopes to work with policymakers to either change the law or to encourage the DFI commissioner to revisit her existing policy discretion under Hawaii law, Suarez concluded.

2017-02-28T02:00:10-04:00,Antonopoulos Details Bitcoin’s Two Layers of Protection Against Quantum Computing,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/antonopoulos-bitcoins-protection-against-quantum-computing/,"Andreas Antonopoulos is a well-known visionary and speaker within the Bitcoin community. Lately, there’s been a lot of conversations and media headlines discussing the development of quantum computers breaking elliptic curve cryptography. Antonopoulos believes Bitcoin will be okay if the system upgrades, as research in quantum computing develops further. The technical expert also details that Satoshi’s genius back in the day had preconceived plans on how to handle the issue of quantum computing.       An attendee listening to a keynote speech given by Andreas Antonopoulos asks: “Is it possible, for example, that the NSA boasts a quantum computer that will be able to break Bitcoin’s cryptography?” “Yes, it is certain that the NSA has already built quantum computers, because Google has one in their data center, and if they have one the NSA has one that is ten times better, that costs as much as a moon mission and that can break encryption systems at a much better rate and with more efficiency,” explains Antonopoulos. “Now here’s the interesting question — Do they use that to break Bitcoin?” “The simple answer is ‘no’. We know from history that if you have such a thing, this is the most important and well-guarded secret. Any time you use it you have to come up with a parallel construction story that tells the world how you managed to break that encryption without using such a thing, because such a thing doesn’t exist. When the British captured the Enigma they would let ships sink because they didn’t have a good enough story of how they knew the U-boat was going to be there. They let cities be bombed because they didn’t have a good enough story of how they knew they were going to be bombed and so if they couldn’t create a good enough story they could not risk revealing the most important secret they have.” During the discussions on the topic of quantum computers breaking Bitcoin’s cryptography, Antonopoulos says there are two fundamental cryptographic systems that keep Bitcoin safe. The way Satoshi designed these elements was not an accident, explains Antonopoulos. “No, the NSA is not going to hack us with their quantum computer,” Antonopoulos detailed to the crowd. “The interesting thing is what happens when that technology becomes commercially viable and more broadly available. That’s where you see two of Satoshi’s initial design choices that in retrospect are absolutely genius. First of all, Bitcoin uses two fundamental cryptographic systems in order to achieve its security. One is elliptic curve multiplication on a prime field which is a one-way function. That depends on prime factorization mathematics which is vulnerable to quantum technology. The other is hash algorithms, and hash algorithms are not actually factorizable with quantum technology. We don’t have very good algorithms for breaking hashes with quantum computing.” Antonopoulos believes Satoshi’s choice to add these two layers of protection was quite genius. In the future, the community will have to prepare for quantum level computers that could crack elliptic curve, and when that happens, the protocol will have to upgrade.   “All of this means you can’t go back and look at keys that were addresses three years ago and simply crack them because you don’t have the public keys. All you have if they haven’t been spent is the double hash of an address. This little genius design element is not an accident. What it does is, it creates a second abstraction layer of the underlying cryptographic algorithm used in elliptic curve digital signatures allowing you to do future upgrades. Which means that the past is secure because it is hidden behind the second veil of a different algorithm and the future can be changed because you can present an address that is not the hash of an elliptic curve, or its the hash of a different elliptic curve, or its the hash of a bigger elliptic curve, or its the hash of a signing algorithm that is quantum resistant that has nothing to do with elliptic curve. So, you can do a forward modification to secure the future, and you’ve got backward protection because you have hid the past.” He adds: “A brilliant little design element that most people have missed. So quantum computers — we upgrade.” What do you think about what Antonopoulos has to say about the future of quantum computing and the Bitcoin network?

2017-02-27T19:00:36-04:00,Learning Cryptography Through Bitcoin’s Proof of Existence Feature,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/learning-cryptography-bitcoin-proof-existence/,"Proof-of-existence (PoE) is a utility built into the Bitcoin blockchain that allows anyone to store records in an immutable fashion.  Also read: Bitcoin Nostalgia: Can Some Bitcoins Be Worth More Than Others? Stored records held on the blockchain may not have legal implementations at the moment but very well could in the near future. For instance, the state of Arizona has introduced a bill recognizing blockchain-based contracts into the legal system. Even so, using the distributed database to safekeep certain data will make sure your records are cemented in history. This includes documents such as a will, a land title, digital copyrights, and more. Digitally storing your records on the Bitcoin blockchain takes a bit of practice but can be done by anyone. The best way to create a stored document that is meant to be private on a public blockchain is to encrypt the data. The first thing you want to do is create some public and private keys using your computer. Any operating system can generate these keys with programs like ssh-keygen for Linux and Apple users, and Windows users can use a software called Puttygen. Public-key or asymmetric cryptography uses mathematically tethered keys that allow for encryption and decryption protocols. Using Puttygen, users just launch the program and click ‘generate RSA keys’, enter a unique key passphrase, and save the newly created public and private keys. After receiving the key pair, the next step is to create a message digest where you will add the document, record, or text to a hash function. Message digest software can be found online and computes a string of different cryptographic algorithms such as MD2, MD4, MD5, and SHA-256. By creating the message digest, this will create a unique input for the data you recorded. Following this step, you want to encrypt the information using your newly created private key which also adds your digital signature to the information. There are a few different ways to prepare the data for a blockchain PoE scheme. For instance, software developer Chris Ellis explains how to create a world citizenship certificate on Github with an XML or JSON file using digital signatures and the blockchain.  Lastly, you want to tether the signed message digest to your document and add it to the Bitcoin blockchain. One must remember that the blockchain can be used to hash a message digest’s string of characters into a transaction, which is not the same as ‘attaching’ a document or file into the blockchain. The document or file is not stored there only the keys or string of digits attached to a transaction represents the proof of ownership. There are a few ways to add text or a string of digits and record it to the public blockchain. This, in turn, is basically your digitally signed ‘representation’ of your document. Many other messages found on the blockchain are in hex code like Satoshis Genesis block text. These particular kinds of blockchain messages were created using the coinbases‘ 100 bytes of arbitrary text.      The last step can get a bit technical, but if you can complete the steps above, you should be able to follow some online guides that explain how to add a document to the blockchain on your own. There are also online resources that can perform this service for you and apply your data to the blockchain in just a few minutes. PoE services that are currently available include BTProof, Proofofexistence.com, Signatura, and a few others. Boston’s technical university MIT also offers a PoE certificate program that can add academic records to the blockchain. However, always remember when using these services, you are entrusting the integrity of your data to a third-party.  The Bitcoin blockchain has a vast amount of publicized text in hex strings including a Nelson Mandela tribute text, Satoshi’s genesis message, a Len Sassaman Tribute, Wikileaks cablegate data, and thousands more. Additionally, people have used the blockchain to record a baby’s birth certificate, create a global passport, and a marriage certificate.   Using the Bitcoin blockchain’s feature of PoE can be quite beneficial to demonstrate digital ownership of a document. The blockchain also timestamps the information as soon as the transaction processes. This, in turn, will register the data securely throughout a global distributed network allowing a user to prove ownership with the digital signature at any given time in the future. Because this action removes the need for some third-party verification in the future, this use case may affect the legal system, law firms, notarization services and more. Learning how to create public/private keys, and applying secure documents to Bitcoin’s powerful blockchain gives a fascinating look into the world of cryptography.

2017-02-27T16:00:49-04:00,Bitcoin.com’s Bitcoinocracy: Decentralized Voting Powered by Bitcoin,Bitcoin.com,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-coms-bitcoinocracy-decentralized-voting-powered-by-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin.com is pleased to announce the release of its revamped voting tool, Bitcoinocracy, at vote.bitcoin.com. Bitcoinocracy allows bitcoiners to vote with their bitcoin holdings on block size, segregated witness, and many other bitcoin proposals. Related: Bitcoin.com Adds Stash Node Pro to its Online Store In 2015, Bitcoinocracy creator Arsen Gasparian developed a tool that enables voting backed by monetary value and transparency. Bitcoin is not “spent” on Bitcoinocracy —rather, addresses and the bitcoins therein are applied to totals in support of different sides of various issues. This solution can show not how many people support an issue, but rather how many bitcoins support an issue.  Gasparian explains that the idea of Proof of Stake (PoS) voting is not new and has been used in the past with traditional stakeholder voting procedures. The idea of Bitcoinocracy was born from the heated block size debate because Gasparian felt meaningful discussions were becoming controlled and censored on forums. So, he created a tool that would allow the people to “put their money where their mouth is” on various issues.  “That’s why I decided to eventually implement a way for the Bitcoin holders to express their opinion anonymously and incontrovertibly,” explains Gasparian. “I hope that Bitcoinocracy will allow bitcoin owners to overcome any kind of censorship and express their opinion on issues that are important to them. Bitcoin holders are not just clients of a proprietary payment system. They are the owners – the stakeholders that give it value and pay miners the mining reward. They have something at stake, and they should have a voice. It is only fair. I hope Bitcoinocracy will give them the power.” Users of Bitcoinocracy can vote on existing propositions such as development, fungibility concerns, BIP proposals, and even other subjects like whether or not a God exists. Users can additionally submit their own propositions to the platform on subjects they believe are important voting topics. “Most popular wallets support the set of BIPs (BIP21 and BIP70-72) to simplify the purchase/payment process,” says Gasparian. “All the user needs to do is to click the hyperlink on the website and to confirm the payment.”         Bitcoin.com encourages readers to check out the Bitcoinocracy platform. Maybe there’s an important issue you want people to vote on. Perhaps you’d like to contribute your signature to a pre-existing proposition. Bitcoinocracy is an entirely decentralized way the Bitcoin community can measure a stance on any given proposal or debate. By utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, voting is cast with bitcoin through a cryptographic signature. The blockchain’s immutability ensures signed votes cannot be manipulated and will always be available to the public. Check out Bitcoinocracy at vote.bitcoin.com today and make your voice heard!

2017-02-27T14:00:04-04:00,Vays vs Ver: Two Very Different Bitcoin Visions Clash at Anarchapulco,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/tone-vays-roger-vers-different-bitcoin-visions-anarchapulco/,"This week many bitcoiners attended the voluntaryism-based Anarchapulco conference in Acapulco, Mexico to discuss liberty and topics such as Bitcoin. During the weekend The Crypto Show broadcasted a debate between Bitcoin proponent Tone Vays and Bitcoin.com’s CEO Roger Ver concerning the future of Bitcoin scaling. These prominent members of the Bitcoin community had entirely different views on subjects such as fees, hard or soft forks, and scaling solutions in general. The live debate broadcast from Anarchapulco started off with Vays and Ver describing their backgrounds within the Bitcoin economy. During the end of the introduction, Ver explains why he got involved with the cryptocurrency community and why he believes the original direction of Bitcoin, being accessible to everyone, is being undermined. Also read: Wall St. Veteran: ‘Bitcoin Has Proven That It Cannot Be Controlled or Censored’ “The whole subject of this debate is that the goal of Bitcoin and the roadmap is being altered by a bunch of people that came to Bitcoin much more recently than myself and I’m very upset with that,” explains Bitcoin investor Roger Ver. “Because I want to see Bitcoin become a currency that can be used by everyone all over the world to transact with anyone without any permission. The ability for Bitcoin to do that is being undermined at the moment, and that’s very, very concerning to me.” Following this statement, The Crypto Show host asks, “Tone, don’t you want Bitcoin to be for everybody?” “Of course I do,” Vays details. “But I feel that we need to do it in the safest possible way, and the safest possible way is with the smartest developers in the room, who I believe are the ones that have created Segwit. They’ve gotten us this far, I trust their judgment and we can get into some more details, but I’m a huge supporter of Segwit, and that’s the direction I would love to see Bitcoin go.” Roger quickly responds to this statement saying, “Other than an ‘appeal to authority’ do you have a reason why you think Segregated Witness is the right way to go?” “Well they are more technical than me, I don’t have the ability to read the code, there is a huge group of decentralized developers,” Vays responds. “It’s like saying, no I’m sorry, I don’t think people from a town should have a say in how the nuclear reactor in that town should be running, to provide them with electricity. I think it should be nuclear engineers that are responsible for the decisions. — I outsource my technical decisions to a very large decentralized group of developers. And that’s the solution [Segwit] they think is the safest and the best and there are over 100 people involved in that project.” As far as the ‘appeal to authority’, The Crypto Show host mentions that a lot of people feel they want to allow the smartest people to develop this code. Furthermore, the radio show host explains, after discussing the subject with many people; he believes both sides of the argument have technical smarts. Tone disagrees and doesn’t believe both sides have the smarts. “I think it’s important to review the history of what’s going on with Bitcoin,” Roger explains. “So Bitcoin was clearly created to be peer to peer digital cash. Satoshi Nakamoto was the name of the person that created Bitcoin, and he left the project, and when he did, he turned the project over to Gavin Andresen. Around that time I got involved and a whole bunch of other people got involved, and we got really excited about that — And Bitcoin was doing really well. Everyone’s excited about the current price, but the current price is about what it was four years ago. That’s not all that exciting. If you look at it, Gavin Andresen did an amazing job leading the project. We knew that scaling was going to be an issue. He tried to solve that. And a bunch of people that came to Bitcoin much more recently treated him absolutely horribly. They kicked him out of the project. That’s the guy the actual original creator of the project turned over the project to so we could continue on the path that we were on. And then a bunch of new people came to Bitcoin and said they think it’s a good thing if Bitcoin transactions are very expensive, they think it’s a good thing if the Bitcoin blocks are full all the time, they think it’s just fine if everyone has to bid against each other to get included in a Bitcoin block. That’s absolute madness, people are going to use something other than Bitcoin. We need to build Bitcoin into the best, most convenient, easy to use system for everyone in the entire world to use. That means fast confirmations, low risk of double spends, and low transaction fees. It’s terrifying to me that a bunch of people come in and think that if Bitcoin transactions cost $100 each people are still going to use Bitcoin — That’s absolute madness because they’re going to use something else.” Tone responds to Roger’s statement saying: “I can comment on that. I say that very often. Look, if the status quo remains and we don’t end up scaling anything, Bitcoin transaction fees could get as high as $100 per transaction. I don’t want it to go there. If we don’t find a scaling solution, a Bitcoin transaction fee will go to $100, and I don’t have a problem with that. I honestly don’t. I don’t want a debt ceiling increase. I don’t want a half-assed solution to fix something half-assed. I would rather it not be fixed. I’d rather Bitcoin be high volume important $100,000 transactions but at least stay safe, not fork, not have to explain why there are two Bitcoins. That’s my choice. I want Bitcoin to scale, and I think it can scale very safely with Segwit. But if the core developers compromise and do a hard fork, which they have tested and they have determined that a hard fork is not safe, — if they compromise in any way shape or form on a hard fork, which I don’t think they will — but if they do, I will lose my faith in the core developer team. I would no longer consider Bitcoin programmed by people that want the best for Bitcoin. I would rather have the status quo and have that transaction fee go high and be used for $100,000 transactions or thousand dollar transactions, and maybe people will be able to afford that $100 fee.” The two continue the debate talking about who uses bitcoin and discussing whether people feel hard forks, Segregated Witness, and off-chain solutions like Lightning are safe. Tone looks forward to these types of off-chain implementations that may provide “infinite scaling”. Roger explains his opinion on those types of solutions by quoting Satoshi’s own words from 2010: “He said in regards to Bitcoin scaling the ultimate solution would be to allow the blocks to get as big as they can get.” “And that’s the Bitcoin I signed up for, that’s the Bitcoin that all the early adopters signed up for and understood was going to be the roadmap,” Ver adds. The rest of the debate can be viewed in its entirety here. Bitcoin.com believes in a healthy productive debate when it comes to issues concerning Bitcoin. Discussions like these are a great way for people to express their opinions in an uncensored fashion.  What do you think about the current state of Bitcoin scaling?

The startup launched an Android app last month and is currently working on an iOS version. Bitcoin.com talked to founder Panagiotis Pollis to learn more about how it works. Also read: Rental Marketplace Portion Uses Bitcoin and Smart Assets Founded in February 2015 and available in 11 different languages, Bitfortip currently has 7,690 users, Pollis told Bitcoin.com. “The idea came to me when I couldn’t find a favorite t-shirt of mine on my own and I was willing to tip someone in order to search online for me”, he shared. Like Yahoo! Answers, but with monetary rewards, users of the site have mostly posted on the platform in hopes of finding an uncommon item that they have seen offline, such as a particular lamp, seashell, car, or copper plumbing valve. Some are there looking for a great price on an item that can be found in a store. At other times, the poster will ask for instructions, such as how to setup a Litecoin mining rig. In each case, they have to put down a small amount of bitcoin to ask. Since the Android app launch, the startup has seen an increase in registration rates. “It took 1.5 years to reach 3,800 users”, Pollis said, but added that it only took them 6 months to double their user base and get to where they are now. The majority of the users are from the U.S, India, Greece, Germany, UK, Colombia, Venezuela, Canada, Nigeria, South Africa, he revealed. The platform’s Android app has 31 reviews on Google Play with 4.7-star rating. “When you sign up, a unique Bitcoin address is generated in your account”, according to the app’s website. Users will then see the message: “Before you can submit an inquiry you need to fund your account with at least with 0.0001 bitcoin to give as a reward. After you fund your account, you can post an inquiry with a bitcoin reward of your choice”. Once a question is marked as correct by the asker, “The bitcoin reward is immediately released and credited to the person that gave the right answer”, Pollis said. “The person that won, when he logs into his account again, he will see his balance.” Currently, there is no time limit on when questions have to be marked correct. The asker can also request the question to be deleted. “I’ve had some recommendations from users to force an administrator to mark an answer as correct after a time period”, he said. “But I so far refused to do so because that has two downsides”, he explained, citing the inquirer might disagree with the answer that he personally found as correct and does not want spend the asker’s money without his approval. For earnings, the minimum payout is 0.0001 BTC and is sent immediately when the user presses the withdraw button on the site, and confirms by email. To date, 449 questions have been posted on the site and received 6,450 answers, Pollis shared, adding that: What do you think of Bitfortip? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-02-27T06:00:56-04:00,4 Apps Helping Bitcoiners With Tax Compliance,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/4-apps-helping-bitcoiners-with-tax-compliance/,"The U.S. is already well into tax season, and many bitcoin users will have capital gains to declare this year. To help them remain tax compliant, there are numerous software programs to help keep track of digital currency cost basis and profits over the course of one’s mining, buying, trading or earning bitcoins. Related: IRS Asks to Postpone Hearing with Coinbase Bitcoiners often debate on online forums whether or not Bitcoin should be taxed, and former presidential-candidate Rand Paul has even suggested a laissez-faire approach to Bitcoin regulation. Bitcoin tax law, however, remains vague today. After the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released their March 2014 guidance on Bitcoin tax responsibilities, San Jose State University professor Annette Nellen helped the American Institute of CPAs draft a request for further guidance on bitcoin tax law. The IRS never responded; that is, perhaps, until they sent Coinbase a John Doe summons requesting information from the digital currency exchange’s customers. Not much is certain when it comes to Bitcoin tax law. What is for sure: Bitcoin gains are taxable. Income, no matter if it is in national currency or digital currency, is taxable unless the IRS states differently. Indeed, U.S. citizens could be liable for taxes on their trading, holding, spending, mining, gifting, tipping, and donating of bitcoins. Bitcoin.com gathered information on services that can make paying Bitcoin-related taxes easier – at least for those not living the ‘PT’ lifestyle, of course.  This solution works for businesses which deploy a cryptographic ledger, trade digital assets or simply experiment with smart contracts.

2017-02-26T19:00:04-04:00,Stegoseed: Hiding Bitcoin Seed Keys In Plain Sight,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/stegoseed-hiding-bitcoin-seed-keys-in-plain-sight/,"James Stanley, a Bristol-based software developer, has developed a tool that steganographically encodes Bitcoin wallet seeds. Stegoseed essentially gives Bitcoin users the ability to hide funds in plain sight. Also read: The Joinmarket Community Wants to Improve Bitcoin’s Fungibility Stanley’s stegoseed is a tool that enables Bitcoin users to encode and decode BIP39 seeds steganographically. Steganography is the art of concealing images, messages, files, or video within another one of these four mediums. The practice of obscuring messages in this fashion was first recorded in 440 BC. Stegoseed allows users to hide a seed phrase in randomly-generated text, or hide the seed in an existing piece of text. The output stegoseed creates is a series of sentences containing the BIP39 words given by the user. The words are “in the correct order, and do not contain any other BIP39 words — We can simply remove all non-BIP39 words to retrieve the original seed,” details the platform’s developer. Stanley also provides an example of his work by re-wording an existing news article using a loaded BIP39 wallet seed. “I manually removed all of the existing BIP39 words from the article, and then inserted the words corresponding to my own BIP39 wallet seed,” explains Stanley. “It contains some funds as a prize for whoever sweeps it first (update: this has been taken).”  Bitcoin.com chatted with James Stanley, and he told us why he created a tool that conceals seeds and the possible benefits of utilizing this steganographic method. “I love coming up with fun ways to hide wallet seeds,” Stanley tells Bitcoin.com. “We don’t need anything like this for traditional banking because the legal system pretty much guarantees that even if somebody gains access to your bank account, you’ll eventually get your money back. Bitcoin has no such guarantee, so as Bitcoin gains adoption I think we’ll see more creative ways of safely backing up wallets.” Now Stanley does not suggest publicly uploading your seed online even if you use a steganographically encoded phrase. However, it may be a good method to store your keys at your house where a random thief will likely have no idea what it is, explained Stanley. “I can see two classes of use cases for paper seeds in general: when you want to backup your wallet long-term, and when you need to travel somewhere where you can’t trust that your hardware wallet or other devices won’t be stolen or tampered with,” Stanley added. Stanley says he enjoys playing with Bitcoin, Tor, and cryptography in general. The software developer has also created SMS Privacy, a platform that allows users to buy mobile phone numbers anonymously for bitcoin. Stegoseed is another example of Stanley’s devotion to privacy and cryptographic methods using Bitcoin. What do you think about Stegoseed? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-02-26T09:00:37-04:00,Rental Marketplace Portion Uses Bitcoin and Smart Assets,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/rental-marketplace-portion-bitcoin-smart-assets/,"Portion is an upcoming decentralized marketplace built on Bitcoin’s blockchain. Using Portion’s smart asset tags, users will be able to earn bitcoins by renting out anything to other users. Bitcoin.com caught up with CEO Jason Rosenstein to learn more about his new venture. Also Read: Bitcoin Freelance Marketplace Rein Launches in Beta  The New York-based 11-man team behind Portion is currently finalizing their angel funding and product development, including an iOS app. The company has launched a new website and is currently looking for beta testers for their upcoming product launch in April. Renting out unused goods, everything from an old toy to a new moving truck, can be tricky on a website such as Craigslist because items are not well tracked and ownership is not assured. Portion uses adhesive “holographic smart-tags” to represent a physical item as a virtual asset on the blockchain, which can then be used to prove the authenticity of the physical item as well as its custody. “Smart-tags are fraud resistant and leave a watermark if removed”, Portion website says. To put an item up for rent using Portion, a user “simply tags that item thereby making it ‘smart-property’”, Rosenstein explained to Bitcoin.com. “Once tagged, the individual will upload product details, images, rental period, and all other details to the marketplace”, he conveyed. When another user wants to rent that item at an agreed upon price and duration, the item will be delivered to the renter, he detailed. Beta testers will be using the ‘freemium’ model which will allow them to lend assets within their groups of friends. “This ‘closed network’ approach will allow users to tag, loan, and track goods to those they know at no fee. This will provide Portion with the insights and customer feedback we need to continue to be successful”, the CEO described. Rosenstein said that “payments supported will be bitcoin & USD”, adding that: Specifically, “We will be using Counterparty to create assets”, he further described, noting that “This will all be obfuscated to the end user, who is simply somebody wishing to put a good on the market”. “Smart contracts are utilized to facilitate the marketplace, payments, security, and other crucial logistics”, he expressed. Using an example of a person loaning out a camera lens, he said the lens “becomes smart-property after it has been tagged with a Portion tag”. The cryptographic asset representing the lens is sent between smartphone apps. Rental rates are set by the user for each item. “Users can charge whatever they want”, Rosenstein said. For Portion’s fee, the company is still “exploring algorithms to calculate fees” but the CEO believes that “it is generally accepted in the rental space to charge between 10% – 20%”, so future fees in that range may apply. However, Portion plans to provide smart-tags for free at first. “Each individual will be able to procure 5 smart tags at no cost. From there, we will send more at no cost if they become a power user”, Rosenstein revealed. “This will ensure we continue to grow and nurture our advocates and give them everything they need to make our marketplace as liquid as possible”.

2017-02-26T06:00:38-04:00,How One of the Original Cypherpunks Recalls Bitcoin’s Inception,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/original-cypherpunks-recalls-bitcoins-inception/,"In the early nineties, a group of cryptography experts called ‘cypherpunks’ gave life to ideas like digital currency and promoting freedom through the use of technology. Timothy C. May was one of these visionaries, and he predicted the rise of encrypted messaging, cryptocurrencies, and electronic contracts. Also read: Europe Lays Out Roadmap to Restrict Payments in Cash and Cryptocurrencies Just recently the hacker house Paralelní Polis in Prague released a keynote talk by May. His speech, called “Thirty Years of Crypto Anarchy”, saw the former Intel engineer describe the early days of the cypherpunk movement. The group of privacy advocates and May started organizing in Silicon Valley, as well as online, using the cypherpunk electronic mailing list. Cypherpunks from San Francisco include Eric Hughes, John Gilmore, St. Jude and others. May, being one of the most vocal of this crew, wrote many crypto-anarchy themed pieces throughout the 1990s and into the early 2000s. Many of May’s essays foretold the coming of technologies that would undermine perceived tyranny and surveillance of nation-states. One of these essays, written in 1988, was called the “Crypto-Anarchist Manifesto”. It envisioned the use of decentralized technologies like Bitcoin to ultimately disrupt the operations of corporations and governments. Following May’s recollection of the origins of the cypherpunk movement, the former engineer spoke about Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the infamous DAO debacle last summer. After distancing himself from the cypherpunk mailing list, May discovered an online character calling himself Satoshi who was distributing information on a new digital currency. “In the mid-2000s, around 2006-2007, a lot of people began revisiting digital currency,” May explains to the crowd at Paralelní Polis. “In 2008-2009 through the ‘cryptography mailing list’, the successor to the ‘cypherpunk’s mailing list,’ a person going by the name of Satoshi issued a white paper proposing a system which solved the Byzantine consensus problem in a novel way using Proof-of-Work.” May details throughout his story how Bitcoin was a technology that did not ask for permission from government agencies. “[Bitcoin] is yet another example of something thrust out there into the world and was in widespread use before there was any time to stop it,” May states. The cypherpunk movement’s founder then goes on to explain his opinion of Ethereum and the recent DAO incident. May explains that the hacker legitimately got away with the theft of Ether because of the way the code was written. May explains that the “killer app for Ethereum has not yet appeared.” Ethereum is more general purpose than Bitcoin, but it is not yet clear what the killer app for that is going to be. May follows cryptocurrency news on Reddit and believes the many blockchains, announced daily, will most likely fall by the wayside. May wrote about cryptocurrencies many years before bitcoin was conceived. During the end of May’s discussion, he detailed that the prospects of the original cypherpunk movement are still bright.

2017-02-25T19:00:09-04:00,The Butterfly Effect of Chinese Bitcoin Regulations,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/butterfly-effect-chinese-bitcoin-regulations/,"Over the past few weeks, China has implemented regulations across all bitcoin exchange operations within the country. This, in turn, has caused a significant drop in trading volumes within the region. Some people speculate that Chinese bitcoin traders are now going abroad finding friendlier overseas entrances to bitcoin exchanges. Also read: An Alliance Forms Under China’s New Bitcoin Regulations According to reports, the People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) new regulatory policies are affecting Chinese bitcoin traders. The decision to cease margin lending, add fees to every trade and pausing withdrawals has led to Japan taking the lead in global bitcoin trading volume. However Chinese bitcoin trader Lin Qi (pseudonym) tells the China Business Journal (CB) he is optimistic and traders should maintain their holdings rather than sell. To outsiders, Lin Qi says the situation looks dismal, but to him, the PBOC’s attitude toward bitcoin is still friendly.   Moreover, a veteran bitcoin business owner in China, Li Qian (pseudonym), told CB that bitcoin turnover rate in China used to be high but now due to regulations things have changed a great deal. “You should view the impact of this regulation storm from both the upstream and downstream directions of the business,” explains Li Qian. “For the those at the upstream direction, i.e. the bitcoin miners, they are not affected. Chinese miners continue to mine as usual. Our electricity and labor cost are always cheap. The most affected is the trading aspect of Bitcoin (exchanges). Currently, the impact of the Chinese market in the world has declined a lot, especially after charging fees, our turnover rate is now severely limited.” Over the past few months, Japan has become a big player within the bitcoin economy. According to an employee from one of the top Chinese bitcoin exchanges, the upcoming Japanese regulations will encourage Japan’s trading volume lead. Japan’s bitcoin regulations are also viewed by regional exchanges as progressive and will help maintain Japan’s position in the cryptocurrency economy. “The Japanese Yen market is now adopting zero fee policies, and became the new leader,” a Chinese bitcoin exchange employee tells CB. “Compared with other countries, Japan seems more friendly to digital currency. Also, the new regulation methods will be effective; Bitcoin will be a legal way of payment.” Over the past few months, Japanese exchanges like Coincheck, Bitflyer, and Zaif have had a significant influx of bitcoin traders. Furthermore, the Japanese-based GMO Internet group plans to create an exchange as well adding to the growing list of bitcoin exchanges within the region. People are also speculating another reason the PBOC may be regulating bitcoin more strictly. According to a recent report by Bloomberg, some think the new policies may correlate with an upcoming PBOC cryptocurrency. In January 2016, China’s central bank detailed it was working on a prototype of its own and will have a developed virtual currency in the near future. The Bloomberg report details the central bank cryptocurrency is being advocated by senior officials in the region such as the PBOC deputy governor Fan Yifei.  Many people wonder what will happen to the bitcoin industry after all of these new regulations, inspections, formed alliances and closed door meetings. Li Wei, a researcher at 21st Century Research Institute, explains to CB that Chinese regulators are not encouraging bitcoin adoption, but are also not forbidding it. Wei believes the technology itself is beyond country borders and in the long run, it will be difficult for the nation state’s regulators to effectively manage it.

2017-02-25T10:00:58-04:00,What to Expect From Ledgerx’s ‘Physically-Settled’ Bitcoin Options,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/expect-ledgerxs-physically-settled-bitcoin-options/,"Institutional trading and clearing platform Ledgerx is preparing to offer ‘physically-settled’ bitcoin options. The company is currently waiting for full regulatory approval from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to trade and clear bitcoin options. Bitcoin.com caught up with CEO Paul Chou to find out more about their upcoming bitcoin derivatives products. Also read: EU Parliament Report Recognizes the Bitcoin Blockchain’s ‘Dominance’  Ledgerx has two registration applications pending with the CFTC. The first is as a swap execution facility (SEF), for which it received a temporary registration approval from the Commission in September 2015. The other is as a derivatives clearing organization (DCO), which any clearinghouse must register as before providing clearing services with respect to futures contracts, options on futures contracts and swaps. “If approved, Ledgerx would be the first federally regulated bitcoin options exchange and clearinghouse to list and clear fully-collateralized, physically-settled bitcoin options for the institutional market”, the company’s website claims. In December, Miami International Holdings (MIH) announced the completion of an investment in Ledgerx’s parent company, Ledger Holdings. Early investors of the company include Google Ventures and Lightspeed Venture Partners, a venture capital firm out of Menlo Park, California. The latest investment provides Ledgerx with “the capital that is critical to help us meet the minimum financial requirements necessary to be approved as a DCO and SEF by the CFTC”, Chou remarked at the time. While pending CFTC’s approval, the company is “restricted from any live trading or clearing activities”, Chou told Bitcoin.com. Bitcoin.com (BC): What and how many products will Ledgerx offer? Paul Chou (PC): Ledgerx will initially list vanilla puts and calls on bitcoin with standardized strikes and expirations. Strikes will be in a range around the current spot price and expirations will be from one-to-six months in tenor. BC: Where will these products be listed? PC: The products will be listed on the Ledgerx SEF (Swap Exchange Facility) and cleared by the LedgerX DCO (Derivatives Clearing Organization). We’re an integrated exchange and clearing operation so all parts of the transaction lifecycle from contract listing, trade matching, to final settlement are handled by us. BC: Can you explain what “fully-collateralized, physically-settled bitcoin options” mean? PC: Ledgerx’s focus is on physically-settled options. This means that the long holder of the option has the right to purchase, in the case of a call, or sell, in the case of a put, actual bitcoin. This is in contrast to derivatives that are cash-settled, where the holder receives fiat. BC: What is the benefit? PC: Accepting bitcoin as collateral at the clearinghouse enables us to fully-collateralize physically-settled positions such as short call options, ensuring that the clearinghouse holds the full deliverable for all trades. This model reduces risk for participants and enables comfort around clearing a new, volatile asset class. A long option holder will never have to worry about taking a forced haircut on his expected bitcoin deliverable. BC: Who can buy/trade Ledgerx products? PC: Any participant who is an Eligible Contract Participant (as defined by the Commodities Exchange Act) may participate in trading on the Ledgerx SEF. Under this definition, retail would not qualify, but a range of hedgers and professional investors would be eligible. BC: How much interest do you expect these products to garner? PC: BC: What is Ledgerx spending its time on while waiting for the CFTC’s approval? PC: In addition to continuing various tests of the platform, we’ve been working on product development for other derivatives we can list down the line. We expect to have a range of interesting digital currency-related products that will suit both hedgers and investors / speculators; these products will look nothing like traditional financial derivatives and we aim to introduce them later this year.

2017-02-25T04:00:33-04:00,The Practice of Predicting the Price of Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/practice-predicting-price-bitcoin/,"“The hereditary gift of prophecy will go to the grave with me,” the infamous ‘super forecaster,’ Nostradamus, said in the year 1555. Indeed, there have been many investors and economists who tried to predict bitcoin’s price value over the years. Some of them have been significantly on point with their predictions, while others have been way off target.  For instance, Yves Lamoureux, president and chief behavioral strategist of macroeconomic research firm Lamoureux & Co., recently predicted that bitcoin will “eventually catapult” to at least US$25,000 or more. Also read: An Alliance Forms Under China’s New Bitcoin Regulations According to economist Yves Lamoureux, bitcoin is on a course to blast off into bubble territory. Lamoureux states that he predicts an “end target of $25,000 or more” in regards to bitcoin’s price value. The president of Lamoureux & Co thinks that people are starting to look at cryptocurrency for the same reasons people buy gold. “One of the reasons people buy gold is to avoid the dilution of fiat money,” explains Lamoureux. “This is why we are convinced that digital money or cryptocurrencies will eventually find its appeal with hard asset investors.” Lamoureux details that, back when gold was trading at $300, proponents “fought tooth and nail” to get media coverage. He says that the gold market played out across many decades, in many cycles. “And as blockchain becomes more ubiquitous, it lends credibility to the technology behind bitcoin. We feel that digital currencies, such as bitcoin, have now entered a similar cycle,” Lamoureux adds. Many others have tried to forecast bitcoin’s value. Just last week the firm Emerita Capital suggested bitcoin’s price may rise to over $3,600 if a bitcoin ETF is approved by the SEC.  Back in December, the South African entrepreneur Vinny Lingham predicted that the price of bitcoin would blow by the $800s and enter the $900s rather quickly. Lingham’s prediction came true, as many of his forecasts have.   Another notable past prediction was Tim Draper’s 2018 price forecast. A venture capitalist and strong bitcoin supporter, Draper said in a 2014 interview that bitcoin would hit $10,000 by 2018.  Many bitcoin experts tried to predict the cryptocurrency’s price in February 2014, and many of them were way off the radar. For instance, Alan Silbert, the CEO of Bitpremier, said, “It should be a year of big name business adoption. $2,000.” Even Ethereum’s inventor Vitalik Buterin revealed his bitcoin price prediction, stating:   According to the Harvard Business Review, forecasting takes practice. “The top-performing ‘super forecasters’ were consistently more accurate, and only became more so over time,” explains the Review. “A big part of that seems to be that they practiced more, making more predictions.” Predictions will always be a favorite pastime for humans to enjoy. It is no different when discussing the value of bitcoin in the years to come. Many will also try to forecast bitcoin’s death, as they have in the past…over and over again.

2017-02-24T12:00:05-04:00,Analyst: Bitcoin’s Market Cap Could Grow âWell Beyond $100 Billionâ,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/analyst-bitcoins-market-cap-100-billion/,"On Thursday, former Needham analyst Spencer Bogart, famed for predicting the sub-25 percent chance of the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approving a Bitcoin ETF, published a blog post estimating that bitcoin’s market cap could reach âwell-beyond $100 billionâ. Also read: Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF âVery LowâÂ  Bogart has recently left his position as Vice President of Equity Research at Needham where he published many investment reports focusing on Bitcoin, including coverage of Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust. He has joined Blockchain Capital as managing director and head of research. Launched in the fall of 2013, Blockchain Capital is a startup by Brock Pierce and co-founders Bart Stephens and Brad Stephens. The venture capital firm has invested in 42 companies including Abra, Alphapoint, Bitaccess, Bitfury, Bitgo, Bitpesa, BTCC, Chain, Civic, Coinbase, Gem, itbit, Kraken, Ledgerx, Stampery, Terion, Wave, and Xapo. Bogart describes Bitcoin as “a quintessential disruptive technology that is moving from smaller and harder to serve markets toward more mainstream, high-value markets”, adding that: In addition, he observes that âOver the past few years, bitcoin has also grown tremendously by nearly all measurable statsâ. He named two of his favorite indicators. The first is the ‘estimated USD transaction volume’ which he said is “a reasonable proxy for economic activity of the Bitcoin network”, and its daily economic activity has more than quadrupled (CAGR 160%+) over the past 18 months. “Simply stated, Bitcoin has gained significant economic momentum”, he wrote. The second of his favorite indicators is the ‘Bitcoin network hash rate’, which measures the computing power that is securing the Bitcoin network. “As is readily observed, this metric has increased five-fold since the beginning of 2016 (300% CAGR)”, he revealed, citing that âthis amount of computing power is thousands of times more powerful than the worldâs top-500 supercomputers combinedâ. While not a direct comparison, itÂ indicates that the amount of computing power helping to secure the Bitcoin network is immense, Bogart conveyed. While bitcoin has a market capitalization of over $18 billion at press time, Bogart wrote that “Unless trends reverse drastically, bitcoin is on its way to becoming a $100B+ market over the next few years”. In addition, he noted that : These tailwinds consist ofÂ factors that can be grouped into ‘internal’ and ‘external’ factors of Bitcoin and its ecosystem. Internal factors include Bitcoin’s endemic features like multisignature protection and time-locked transactions, apps that require bitcoin to use, and maturing market fundamentals such as liquidity and stability. The external factors he cited are national policies and financial crises. National policies can be for or against Bitcoin such as Switzerlandâs pro-Bitcoin stance or Chinaâs capital outflow restrictions. What do you think ofÂ the $100B+ market cap estimate?

2017-02-24T10:00:15-04:00,The Recently Discovered Cloudflare Bug Could Affect Bitcoin Users,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/cloudflare-bug-could-affect-bitcoin-users/,"On February 17 an individual had discovered a bug with the Cloudflare infrastructure, a company that many bitcoin companies use for DoS protection and other services. The severity of the bug is considered very bad, and security credentials for many bitcoin accounts should be changed. Also read: The Bitcoin Exchange Thefts You May Have Forgotten The Cloudflare system has reportedly been leaking significant amounts of uninitialized memory which could contain sensitive data, including two-factor authentication (2FA) secrets and passwords.  According to many reports including the person who found the bug, this may have been happening for months, and the data may have been spraying onto the open web. The leak could possibly lead to people’s accounts being compromised on many bitcoin websites and services. Bitcoin websites that could be affected include Coinbase, Localbitcoins, Poloniex, Kraken, Bitfinex, Bittrex, Bitstamp, Reddit, and many more. Many people in the bitcoin community are warning others to reset their 2FAs and change passwords immediately. Alongside this, bitcoin companies who may have been affected are also warning customers to take the necessary precautions. “A bug was recently discovered with Cloudflare, which Kraken and many other websites use for DoS protection and other services,” states the San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange Kraken. “Due to the nature of the bug, we recommend as a precaution that you change your Kraken security credentials: Change your password, Change your two-factor authentication (remove and re-enable it), Clients who use API keys should generate a new set of keys. You should similarly change your security credentials for other websites that use Cloudflare.” The Cloudflare issue is very reminiscent of the Linode attacks in 2012 and the Heartbleed vulnerability back in the spring of 2014. However whether or not Cloudflare’s leak got into malicious hands is undetermined, but Bitcoiners on forums are shaken up. The uninitialized memory held by the Cloudflare service includes data such as cookies, HTTP content, passwords, and TLS certificates. The person who discovered the bug, Taviso says, “Cloudflare reverse proxies are dumping uninitialized memory.” Furthermore, Taviso also details “It took every ounce of strength not to call this issue ‘Cloudbleed’” “I don’t know if this issue was noticed and exploited, but I’m sure other crawlers have collected data and that users have saved or cached content and don’t realize what they have, etc.,” explains Taviso’s opinion concerning the extent of the damage. “We’ve discovered (and purged) cached pages that contain private messages from well-known services, PII from major sites that use cloudflare, and even plaintext API requests from a popular password manager that were sent over https (!!).” To stay precautious Bitcoin users should take a few minutes to change their passwords and reset their 2FA’s on certain accounts.

Over 1,000 participants of 43 different nationalities consisting ofÂ national governments’ representatives, businesses, NGOs and European institutions gathered to debate key European policy issues. Muscat was the keynote speaker for the event. Instead of delivering a well-prepared speech which he said âwould have bored you to deathâ, he opted to âget into the spirit of this event by proposing ideas, some sensible, others risky, yet others which might sound, and be, outright insaneâ. Instead of address the crowd as âPrime Minister of the Member State holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Unionâ, he is speaking as âa European who is fed up of us going round in circles, and of someone who wants to provoke debateâ.Â Malta is currently holding the Presidency of the Council of the European Union. In his speech, he presented five âprovocative ideasâ on rebuilding the EU. âNow is the time to double down with yet another unthinkable projectâ, he said. Among the list of ideas, Muscat proposed that âEurope should become the bitcoin continentâ.Â The Head of Communication at CEPS, Marco Incerti, then tweeted about the statement, which Muscat retweeted.  âThe rise of cryptocurrencies can be slowed but cannot be stopped,â the PM conveyed. âSome financial institutions are painstakingly accepting the fact that the system at the back of such transactions is much more efficient and transparent than the classical ones,â he added, as transcribed by Live News Malta. The Maltese PM then elaborated: Muscat then went on to present the four other controversial ideas to his fellow Europeans, including selling citizenships to the EU and opening a dialog with Turkey about their human rights problems. At the conclusion of his speech, he said that he hopes the five ideas incites a few debates and that he looks forward to their reactions. Do you think Europe should be the bitcoin continent?

2017-02-24T06:00:40-04:00,How Specifically The EU & US Intend To Tax Your Bitcoin,Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/specifically-eu-us-intend-tax-bitcoin/,"For the EU and US, the Wild West days of bitcoin are over. 2017 will be the year of bitcoin regulation and taxation during which individuals need information and caution.  Also Read: Fedcoin: The U.S. Will Issue E-Currency That You Will Use The bad news: Central bankers want private, centralized blockchains to facilitate all movement of wealth so they can skim the top. Complicit governments intend to regulate competitors, including individual wallet holders, and then collect a ‘fee’ in the form of taxes. The good news: Bitcoin cannot be regulated without disabling the internet or the bitcoin network, which is arguably the largest and most diverse network in the world. “If you want to kill Bitcoin, it will be an impossible task,” the Former Governor of the Bank of China LH Li recently stated. More bad news: Central banks and governments will try. LH Li added, “So it [bitcoin] will continue to exist. What is important now is that we should properly regulate it.” To avoid becoming collateral damage, individuals should plan now. Of course, the real threat to most readers is not China but the EU or the US, both of which are signaling specific plans to regulate and eventually tax cryptocurrencies. From January 16 to 18, an international conference of some 400 representatives of intelligence units met in Doha, Qatar to discuss the ‘problem’ of money laundering (tax evasion) through digital currencies. The conference sprang from an alliance between the Basil Institute, Europol and Interpol. Bitcoin was mentioned by name; “Special attention should be given to the international exchange of suspicious Bitcoin addresses that threaten economic stability.” Economic stability is bureaucratese for economic control. Six recommendations for action resulted.  In summary: Exchanges and wallet providers are targeted because they are low-hanging fruit. They are far easier to detect and regulate than individuals, which is why individual wallets are the most private alternative. Conventional merchants who accept bitcoin are almost certainly next, and for the same reason as exchanges. Some impending measures are obvious. EU nations will accelerate information sharing, especially of blacklisted bitcoin addresses. EU members that were formerly friendly to bitcoin, such as the Netherlands, may turn hostile. Anti-money laundering regulations and “Know Your Customer” policies will be imposed on exchanges and wallet Providers. For those who value privacy, this is a fine time to consider relocating from exchanges that will function as an arm of the state to exchanges that will put their customers first. Know Your Bank. Know Your Government. Know Your Exchange. The use of mixers and tumblers will be de facto evidence of illegal activity. The EU wants to track ‘suspicious’ transactions in real time and it will “not tolerate” being denied. Again, those who value privacy should consider exchanges that are not within unfriendly resident nations. The crime of “unexplained wealth” is becoming globally popular, with Australia and the UK actively proposing legislation. Turning “unexplained wealth” into a criminal offense gives the tax people a blank check to sift through the worth of everything you own, of every cent you receive. You are guilty until or unless you can demonstrate innocence to the tax man’s satisfaction. If your assets appear disproportionately high compared to your income, then be prepared to document the sources. Of course, it is possible to live within your visible means and carefully document it. Coinbase, a popular American cryptocurrency service provider, is a cautionary tale on several levels. In March 2014, the IRS issued its “Virtual Currency Guidance” on the tax requirements for cryptocurrencies. The guide created confusion more than it clarified. Lacking an enforcement mechanism and, perhaps, tripping over its own tangled requirements, the IRS sought a nuclear solution. In November 2016, the IRS served Coinbase with a John Doe Summons for the  transaction records of all users between January 1, 2013 and December 31, 2015. A “John Doe” summons does not identify a person but aims at a group or class of people. Because one Coinbase user might be guilty of a crime, all records were to be examined. Many people asked “Why Coinbase?” Coinbase has a reputation for being hyper-compliant with regulations and government demands. Coinbase’s co-founder Brian Armstrong stated, “At Coinbase, our first priority is to ensure that we operate the most secure and compliant digital currency exchange in the world.” Surely this is the last exchange with which the IRS needs to use brute force. But it makes sense that Coinbase would be the first exchange approached; the IRS wants to set a chilling example to others. It may have assumed Coinbase would cave to its demands and an important precedent would be easily established. Coinbase reportedly dug in its heels with Armstrong announcing, “We will likely incur a legal cost of between $100,000 and $1,000,000 in the process of defending our customers from this overly broad subpoena.” The cryptocurrency community applauded. There is a phenomenon known as “demonstrated preference,” however. In short, when a person’s words contradict his actions, you should believe the actions. Coinbase’s recent actions and surrounding events raise the possibility that Armstrong’s announcement was either PR or a position from which he has backed down. Consider: None of the preceding is a smoking gun. Taken together, however, they suggest a pattern: whatever Coinbase states publicly, it seems to continue a course of hyper-compliance. If so, the IRS will undoubtedly pursue other exchanges in the same manner. If so, bitcoiners should use Coinbase and affiliated agencies with full knowledge. Conclusion A poster on Steemit captured the governmental zeitgeist toward bitcoin when he wrote, “The old axiom goes, if you can’t beat them, join them. But for the establishment cartels that seek to rule the world through control over the global monetary system, their addendum to this is, if you can’t beat them, usurp them.” The EU and US cannot beat bitcoin in a fair fight. They cannot beat bitcoin in a rigged fight. But they are going to try. One way or the other, users should get out of the path of damage.  Images via Shutterstock.

2017-02-23T15:30:09-04:00,Bitcoin Price Surpasses 2013 All Time High,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-price-surpasses-2013-time-high/,"According to recent charts, the price per bitcoin has surpassed it’s 2013 all time high (ATH) on February 23, 2017, reaching $1168 per BTC. Related: Bitcoin’s Transaction Queue Sets a New Record Bitcoin’s price value has been on a tear throughout most of 2017 and just recently crossed its highest price point ever. Throughout the past few weeks, the cryptocurrency’s price movements have been slowly escalating upwards with a few hiccups along the way. News from China’s central bank imposing new regulations on Chinese exchanges slightly stirred markets but the price persevered throughout these events. According to a few different price index sites, bitcoin reached a high of $1165 on November 30, 2013. The price didn’t stay high for very long and suffered a bearish decline over the course of the following year. This years bull run has seen bitcoin’s price remain above the 4-digit mark much longer than 2013’s rise. The run up of 2013 was also a bit more controversial as rumors of trading bots on Mt Gox may have attributed to the year’s price spike. The Mt Gox price ATH is an entirely different and debatable number showing bitcoin hitting $1236 per BTC on December 4th, 2013. Currently, the price is struggling to maintain staying above $1168, but the 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) shows strong support in this range. Technical indicators such as the Stochastic and the Relative Strength Index (RSI) show there may be some heavy selling for the time being. For now, charts suggest the bullish uptrend may take the price to newer ATHs after breaking more resistance. Throughout bitcoin forums and social media sites, bitcoiners have been celebrating the price rise. Surpassing the 2013 rise is quite a milestone and this 2017’s run up has been entirely different from years prior. Many community members are speculating the price spike is due to the upcoming SEC decision concerning the approval of a bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). Currently, there are three ETFs awaiting approval and bitcoin enthusiasts are hoping for an approved decision on March 11. What do you think about bitcoin surpassing 2013’s ATH?

2017-02-23T14:00:22-04:00,Bitcoin’s Transaction Queue Sets a New Record,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-transaction-queue-sets-a-new-record/,"On February 22 the transaction queue for the Bitcoin network, otherwise known as the mempool, reached its all-time-high. During peak hours of the day, over 100,000 transactions were unconfirmed, and many people were once again experiencing significant delays. Related: Bitcoin Transaction Fees Are Up More Than 1200% in Past Two Years As the bitcoin price slowly approached the currency’s all-time-high the network also suffered from significant transaction congestion. For the past 36 hours, there has been a vast backlog of unconfirmed transactions. Currently, at press time there were 108,000 unconfirmed txs waiting in the mempool following the first record breaking 100,000 six hours prior. Of course, there have been lots of people complaining about high fees and long delays throughout the event. Bitcoin.com previously reported that fees have increased by over 1200 percent in the past two years. At present fees being recorded for high priority transactions have been averaging 0.40-0.75 cents per transaction. Alongside this, the network is trying to process 3-4 txs/s, and over 70 btc worth of fees sits in the waiting. The last time the network suffered from significant backlog was on February 2 with over 900,000 btc waiting in the transaction queue. During the rise of unconfirmed transactions on February 2 Bitcoin developer, Lukejr responded to a Reddit post asking for suggestions in regards to the 75K tx backlog that day. “Just pay a $5 fee, and it’ll go through every time unless you’re doing something stupid,” explains Lukejr. The week prior while the network was suffering from congestion on January 24, Lukejr revealed a Github BIP proposal asking to lower the block size. Meanwhile, throughout the congestion, these events have fired up the block size debate on both sides. Currently, there seems to be no sign of compromise for scaling solutions and bitcoin forums are filled with discussions on the best approach. Many bitcoin supporters say they are patiently waiting for Segregated Witness (Segwit), but the implementation is only supported by 26 percent of miners. Another faction of bitcoin proponents looks to the Bitcoin Unlimited client which aims to raise the block size and has 20 percent support at the moment. Currently, the only option for bitcoin users to send a transaction without much delay is to send a transaction with the appropriate fee. 21inc offers a fee calculator to help with the process of sending high priority transactions, based on their charts which are updated every few hours. At the moment the fastest and cheapest transaction fee is 180 satoshis/byte, or for a median transaction size of 226 bytes, the fee is 40,680 satoshis.  Another way a user can bump a transaction up the queue is by utilizing the Replace-By-Fee (RBF) option that’s available for core client users. This means nodes will accept a relayed double spend with a higher fee and miners may accept these transactions faster. Essentially RBF allows the second transaction to process with its higher fee, and the first broadcast is dropped from the network. Additionally, the mining pool Viabtc has released a transaction accelerator that can be utilized to prioritize low fee transactions. Users simply submit a TXID that includes a minimum 0.0001BTC/KB fee to Viabtc’s accelerator. The transaction will then be prioritized by Viabtc, and the pool will mine these transactions on the next block they mine. However, there is a maximum of 100 txs that can be submitted every hour, but the service is completely free. Rumor has it that other pools have also created tx accelerators but will charge a fee to use the service. Many bitcoiners have tried to figure out why these backlogs are taking place more frequently. Some believe an individual or organization may be creating spam attacks on the network or sending significant amounts of low fee transactions. Other people suggest the congestion is due to the rising price as traders are likely exchanging bitcoins more often. Whatever the case may be the congestion has yet to subside, and the mempool transaction count continues to remain at its highest level.

2017-02-23T12:00:23-04:00,Bitcoin Transaction Volumes Playing Increased Role Amid China Shakeup,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-transaction-volumes-play-increased-role-amid-china-shakeup/,"“If you had told most people that the vast majority of Chinese trading volumes were going to disappear and Bitcoin was going to hold over $1,000, people would not have believed you just a month-and-a-half ago,” ARK blockchain products lead Chris Burniske tells Bitcoin.com. “That bitcoin’s value is potentially more supported by its transacting volume than its trading volume is counter to the narrative that bitcoin is supported mostly by speculation.” Indeed, it appears the Bitcoin market is adjusting to new regulations from the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) regarding areas like trading fees, margin restrictions and anti-money laundering (AML) and know your customer (KYC) policies. Related: An Alliance Forms Under China’s New Bitcoin Regulations Some market participants anticipate more regulations are forthcoming. Mr. Burniske believes, regardless of whether increased regulation is forthcoming, trading volume will likely pick up again as more institutional traders come online amid excitement over things like a potential Bitcoin ETF, which some suggest could be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission this year.  “When you look at 2016, the ratio of trading volume on exchanges to transacting volume on bitcoin’s blockchain was ten-to-one,” the ARK Invest blockchain specialist imparts.  “A lot of critics say bitcoin has an inflated value because of speculation. But, what we’ve seen as a result of the change in Chinese regulation regarding exchanges is a significant slowdown in trading volumes globally. Right now there is more transaction volume than trading volume.” Mr. Burniske describes how a currency fulfills three core value propositions: a means of exchange, store of value and unit of account.  “It’s important that bitcoin continue to grow as a means of exchange,” Mr. Burniske argues. “Thus far in February, roughly 16% more bitcoin have been transacted on a daily basis than traded.”  He summarizes: “You have an inversion in how Bitcoin is being used, and a significant decline in trading volumes. Nonetheless, the price has been stable.”  What was the source of Chinese exchange volumes? About this, there has been much speculation.  “The most likely hypotheses for what was going on with China is algorithmic trading,” says Mr. Burniske. “There were zero fees and good liquidity. Trying to shave off small gains via algorithmic trading doesn’t necessarily provide much support to Bitcoin’s value-proposition, so losing that trading volume is not necessarily that important for Bitcoin in the long-term.”  Immediately after the PBoC actions, there was a negligible spike in Bitcoin’s volatility. But, since then, the volatility seemingly normalized. The bump that takes place in ‘Jan-17’ below represents the bump in volatility as the PBoC made its recent announcements. As you can see, the market barely shuddered.  “While it might be too early to reach a conclusion, an early hypothesis is declining trading volumes in China will be replaced by another geography,” Mr. Burniske suggests. “Japan comprises now roughly 60% trading volumes, whereas before 90% went through China. The Japanese markets have shifted, as well, and you can see patterns that would suggest these are algorithmic traders. Either way, these trading volumes may not be as important as people previously imagined.” He adds: “Bot traders are shifting to Japanese markets.” What do you think of Bitcoin transaction volume playing an increased role in Bitcoin amid the shakeup in China?  Images courtesy of Shutterstock, ARK Blockchain Bitcoin.com is a unique online destination in the bitcoin universe.

2017-02-23T08:00:56-04:00,How Much Does it Cost to Run a Full Bitcoin Node?,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/cost-full-bitcoin-node/,"Bitcoin’s health largely depends on how many people run the decentralized peer-to-peer network globally by participating as a ‘Bitcoin node,’ which vary in size. A node might represent a single individual with a laptop, a company running a single node for mostly symbolic purposes or even a massive Bitcoin mining farm harnessing a large percentage of Bitcoin’s overall hashing power. In short, Bitcoin nodes keep the Bitcoin blockchain’s peer-to-peer network running.   A full bitcoin node fully validates transactions and blocks. It also helps the network to accept transactions and blocks from other full nodes, as well as validate transactions and blocks, and relay them to other nodes. Perhaps their most useful functionality, other than helping to maintain a healthy Bitcoin network, full nodes generally also have built-in wallet functionality. Related: Bitcoin.com Adds Stash Node Pro to its Online Store To run a node today, one needs generally 125 gigabytes of free disk space, 2 gigabytes of memory (RAM), a broadband Internet connection with upload speeds of at least 400 kilobits (50 kilobytes) per second, and a connection with sufficient download limits. Bitcoin nodes commonly use 200 gigabytes upload or more a month and download around 20 gigabytes per month.  Active redditor ‘BeijingBitcoins’ calculated two months ago how much it costs for him to run a node. He uses a two-year-old Lenovo T440 Thinkpad with an Intel i5, 4GB of RAM and a 500GB HDD. This machine runs $549 brand new on Bitcoin-accepting Newegg. A refurb with 8GB of RAM runs just $340. His internet bill runs $55 per month. The redditor conjectures the setup uses .48kWh per day or 175.2 kWh per year. He pays $0.26 per kWh. So, the node alone costs $0.125 per day to run. That’s $3.74 per month or $45.55 per year for electricity alone.   ‘foragodrolo’, another Redditor, detailed two years ago how he ran a Bitcoin node on Amazon Web Services for $20.43 per month. “Not bad,” he wrote. “And I’m happy to do this for a while giving back for my gains in BTC.” Reddit user ‘MillionDollarBitcoin’ compiled Bitcoin Unlimited on a raspberry Pi 1 Model b with 512MB. It runs at nearly 100% average load, runs no other processes and draws 2 watts of power. Some users detailed procuring a virtual private server for $5-10/month, though this is less desirable. People generally encourage bitcoiners to run nodes to increase the network’s decentralization. Nodes that run 24/7 are needed to make sure the blockchain is always available somewhere.  BitcoinCatSatoshi documented on Reddit how he ran a Bitcoin full node for just $130. The Redditor used a mini PC he found on Aliexpress. The PC featured a N3150 Celeron quad core processor known for low consumption and the user added 8gb of unused RAM and a 500gb HDD. Others have discussed how an appropriately outfitted Raspberry Pi runs just $90 and can also be used as a full Bitcoin node. Most single nodes do, and will likely continue to come from the developed world, with the remainder being server farms as envisioned by Satoshi. Nodes help to maintain Bitcoin’s decentralization. If not enough nodes are running, clients won’t as easily connect through the peer-to-peer network that comprises Bitcoin. A centralized service will have to be substituted for this operation. There are, to be certain, potential risks running a Bitcoin node, depending on the digital currency’s legality in the jurisdiction where one resides, particularly in unstable nations of the developing world.  If you already have a computer, a hard drive, and internet connection, then running a node is easy. Indeed, many node operators even use their daily desktop computers to run the Bitcoin network.  Currently, there are currently just over 6,000 nodes serving all of Bitcoin. The top 5 nations are United States, Germany, France, Netherlands, and Canada.  Do you run a full node? Let us know how much it costs you in the comments below.

Bitcoin miners signal their support of their preferred bitcoin client by ‘relaying’ the version number when they mine new blocks. If 75 percent of all blocks being relayed over a two week period are signaling for BU, the software ‘locks in’ and activates. While the share of the overall network hashrate is not a guarantee of the percentage of blocks being relayed, knowing which pools prefer BU is a common way to form an estimation. CANOE’s addition adds to the roughly 20 percent of total hashpower that prefers the BU client.  The person in charge of the CANOE pool is Ang Li, a bitcoin entrepreneur since 2013 who became a miner in 2015. Li started to build a large-scale mine the following year in Sichuan, which has recently been called the capital of bitcoin mining. Apart from CANOE, a pool called BTC.top is another newcomer that has been publicly supporting BU. BTC.top was launched in December 2016, and now has about 7% of the network’s hashrate. Other pools that have publicly supported BU’s scaling plans include ViaBTC, the Bitcoin.com pool, India’s GBMiners, and a sizable portion of SlushPool. Li told Chinese news website 8btc that Bitcoin’s network congestion is the reason why bitcoin’s block size needs to be increased. While Bitcoin’s users and transactions have been expanding, the network can still only handle between 3 and 7 transactions per second. Li described: A scaling solution called the Lightning Network is being developed by at least five different development teams. Some believe it to be an alternative to the BU client, while others including the BU development team, have pledged support for the Lightning community. The network’s solution calls for high-valued transactions to be processed on the Bitcoin blockchain while 0.042 BTC or smaller transactions are meant to take place across their network instead. Entrepreneurs who open a Lightning ‘Payment Channel’ for the network will be able to collect fees from users directly using the Lightning Network. Keeping transactions ‘on-chain’ will require higher fees under this arrangement. “BS [Blockstream] supports Core dev team’s path which will lead to the Lightning Network”, Li said. “They’re thinking of the interest of their own company and team, but they did not consider the interest of the majority of miners. Meanwhile, their solution cannot solve the long-term problem of network congestion. It is also against the original vision of Bitcoin,” he argued. Li also believes that as new miners and big money flow into the network, most miners cannot fathom the potential outcomes of the various scaling plans like BU and Lightning. The lack of technical knowledge has, in his opinion, contributed their indifferent attitude towards scaling. “We are much more deeply involved in the mining business”, Li shared. “Therefore we want to guide miners to work toward the best of their interest. This is also the reason to found the pool”. He also explained that: The incentives that Satoshi Nakamoto designed in the Bitcoin whitepaper are not enough to sustain mining for long, Li feels, adding that as the block reward halves every four years, miners income will continue to decline. According to him, keeping the block size where it is now will not provide enough incentive and therefore has to be reconsidered. Li also believes that only a larger mining transaction fee will maintain the balance. “By increasing block size, and transaction numbers, the fees will gradually replace the block reward, providing enough incentive for the miners to defend the bitcoin hashrate. This is the fundamental way to achieve healthy development of the whole ecosystem.” Nonetheless, he believes that other scaling plans should not be ruled out. “We support increasing the capacity, it does not simply mean that BU’s plan is the best one. But increasing the capacity is essential,” he noted. His future plan for the pool is to deploy another facility for mining in Xinjiang, named “Dian Jin Blockchain,” or Electric Gold Blockchain. The new project will have a capacity of 130,000kw with the intent to become the largest bitcoin mine in the world. Updated: a previous version of this article stated that Bitmain would take part in the funding of the above mentioned new project. In an email to Bitcoin.com Bitmain clarifies: “Bitmain only built the farm and sold it. Bitmain is funding neither that mining farm nor that mining pool.” What do you think of CANOE?

2017-02-23T01:00:33-04:00,The Joinmarket Community Wants to Improve Bitcoin’s Fungibility,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/joinmarket-community-bitcoin-fungibility/,"Many people within the cryptocurrency environment are on a quest for fungible digital currency transactions. Some have opted to use altcoins while others patiently wait for Bitcoin implementations like Schnorr signatures and Tumblebit. For the time being, there is a platform that Bitcoiners can experiment with that uses coinjoin transactions called Joinmarket. Also read: Europe Lays Out Roadmap to Restrict Payments in Cash and Cryptocurrencies Joinmarket was announced by Bitcoin developer Chris Belcher on Bitcointalk.org in January 2015. The platform operates on either Linux or Windows and aims to improve the privacy of bitcoin transactions. Joinmarket utilizes what’s called coinjoin transactions, which means the protocol mixes multiple people’s transactions together to create obfuscation against transaction analysis. “A coinjoin transaction requires other people to take part,” explains Belcher’s announcement. “The right resources (coins) have to be in the right place, at the right time, in the right quantity. This isn’t a software or tech problem, it is an economic problem. I propose a new kind of market is created that would allocate these resources in the best way.” The protocol’s Github sources state that there are two groups within Joinmarket called market makers and market takers. By initiating a coinjoin transaction, takers pay a fee to the makers incentivizing both groups to perform the process.  “A form of smart contract is created, meaning the private keys will never be broadcasted outside of your computer, resulting in virtually zero risk of loss (aside from malware or bugs). As a result of free-market forces, the fees will eventually be next to nothing,” details Joinmarket. In September 2016, a vulnerability concern with Joinmarket was posted on Github. The announcement called “Joinmarket release 0.2.0 ameliorates this snooping attack” detailed that the platform’s privacy aspect was degraded.  “Joinmarket is a young project, there are some possible vulnerabilities which could be exploited to spy on every user,” explains Github issue #156. “It means that an attacker for free can learn what UTXOs belong to which maker, and can eliminate them when analyzing coinjoins on the blockchain. It’s not trivial to actually obtain all the UTXOs from a maker, but even learning a proportion of them is enough to spy on a large amount of coinjoins.” This news caused concern towards using the project across many social cryptocurrency forums. However, crypto-privacy advocates still applauded the project and believed the platform was still in its infancy. Monero’s Riccardo Spagni had good things to say about Joinmarket when the vulnerability reached the public’s ears.     Joinmarket is still a popular coinjoin application within the community. The platform’s developers had also addressed the snooping attack in a matter of days with Joinmarket’s release version 0.2 and asked the entire community to update.  The community of Joinmarket users has a very active subreddit, and IRC channel for issues with the platform and general development discussion. The protocol’s code is updated regularly and has a vast array of guides for users to implement Joinmarket to the Bitcoin client or Electrum wallet support. At press time, Joinmarket has 80 orders by 62 counterparties on the platform’s order book. “[The] aim is to improve the confidentiality and privacy of bitcoin transactions, as well as improve the capacity of the blockchain, therefore reduce costs,” explains the platform developers. “The concept has enormous potential, but had not seen much usage despite the multiple projects that implement it.” Have you tried Joinmarket?

2017-02-22T19:00:59-04:00,EU Parliament Report Recognizes the Bitcoin Blockchainâs ‘Dominance’,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/eu-parliament-report-recognizes-bitcoin-blockchains-dominance/,"The European Parliament published an “in-depth analysis” on Tuesday on blockchain technology, focusing on âhow Bitcoin’s dominance of the blockchain field could affect wider development of the technology and other applications of distributed ledgersâ, its authors wrote. The 28-page report entitled ‘How blockchain technology could change our lives’ was put together by the European Parliamentary Research Service (EPRS). Also read:Â Europe Committed to Tightening Digital Currency Rules by End of 2017Â  The purpose of the report is to assist the Members and staff of the Parliament âin their parliamentary workâ. However, opinions expressed in it are of the authors alone. Two out of three authors, Philip Boucher and Mihalis Kritikos, areÂ from the European Parliament’s Scientific Foresight Unit. The third, Susana Nascimento, is from the European Commission’s Foresight, Behavioural Insights and Design for Policy Unit. The paper covers both the public and private sectorâs use of blockchain technology and highlights the differences between the two. It explains that bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies “could spearhead a process of decentralisation whereby the institutions that traditionally govern finances â including governments and banks â become less powerful”. However, the authors also noted that âthese same governments and banks are currently driving blockchain research and development in directions that suit their own purposes. These blockchains may prove less decentralised and transparent than othersâ.Â Citing use cases beyond the financial system, the report suggests that: The report went on to discuss blockchain proof of existence, citing that these low-cost services can make the current patent systems more efficient. However, the authors warn: “It must be made clear that proof of existence via a blockchain (or, indeed, any other means) cannot be interpreted as equivalent to patent protection”. They also explain that âFor proof of existence provided by third parties, such as those that make use of the existing Bitcoin blockchain, to be accepted as a legitimate means for keeping records, they would have to be recognised as such by the appropriate enforcement bodiesâ. While claimingÂ how transactions in Europe are usually already fast, cheap and secure, the report authors say users of blockchain applications see additional benefits in its transparency and immutability. They noted: Blockchain-enabled e-voting (BEV) is an example of a blockchain application in the report. BEV would allow voters to log and verify records that are transparent and distributed among users. The authors suggest that a cheap and easy way to develop BEV is to â’piggyback’ a more established blockchain, such as Bitcoinâ. The report also describes a greater social awareness of the blockchainâs usefulness, which itÂ says coincides with a loss of trust in governments and the banking system. It states: “Indeed, there is a growing trend towards less trust in financial and governance institutions and greater social expectations of accountability and responsibility. The popularity of blockchain technology may also reflect an emerging social trend to prioritise transparency over anonymity”. What do you think of this EUÂ Parliament report?

2017-02-22T12:00:19-04:00,Bitcoin Transaction Fees Are Up More Than 1200% in Past Two Years,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-transaction-fees-1200-past-two-years/,"Bitcoin transaction fees are up 1289% since March 2015 as Bitcoin transaction volume in 2017 approximates $250 million per day or about $180,000 per minute. That represents a 55% increase over 2016 and 173% over 2015. Bitcoin has added $10B to its market cap over the last year and currently processes three transactions per second. While Bitcoiners aren’t paying for bitcoin transactions like they did in May 2016, when bitcoin transaction fees peaked, 171 bitcoins in fees still went to miners on February 15. Yet the Bitcoin network continues to grow, transacting upwards of half-a-billion USD so far this year. Bitcoin’s 30-day moving average has moved towards the $1,000 mark. Related: Could Bitcoin Affect Emerging Market Monetary Policy? The peer-to-peer (P2P) bitcoin exchange, Localbitcoins, has seen steady growth throughout its existence, with reports of increased demand for P2P trade where there is economic turmoil or capital controls. “[Localbitcoins] grows at quite steady, predictable pace,” founder Jeremias Kangas tells Bitcoin.com. “In some countries where inflation is high with big differences in currency exchange rates – like Nigeria, Venezuela and others –  the rate at which bitcoins are exchanged can be quite different from what the official rates into fiat are. So, bitcoin might be a more and more relevant tool to get the actual value of a specific currency in the future.” Some call Localbitcoins volume “light” overall but note it’s showing strong growth. The increased demand, though, has pushed Bitcoin up against its block size limit. This has resulted in a two-tier bitcoin transaction process wherein miners consider high transaction fees high priority and low transaction fees low-priority. Underpaid transaction fees can result in bitcoin transactions stalling. At the time of writing, there were more than 67,000 such transactions backed up in Bitcoin’s mempool, which helps the network record transactions. Many online exchanges handle transaction fees themselves so their users enjoy high priority transaction speed. Those who host their own clients, however, could see a bitcoin transaction held up. The most important indicator of transaction fees is how large that fee is when compared to the amount of space a transaction comprises on the blockchain. Called ‘fee/size’, this measurement is taken in satoshis per byte. Bitcoin transactions comprise on average around 226 bytes of space. The current fee level for a 3 block wait transaction confirmation time is 100 satoshis per byte. Thus, for a quick transaction, you must pay 0.00022600 bitcoins, or around 0,25 USD. Once a transaction is sent, it can be monitored through a block explorer like Tradeblock or Blockchain.info. To find your transaction, you will need to know the transaction ID, often visible in a Bitcoin wallet’s transaction history. 21 Inc. has bought the service Cointape and rebranded it into a tool listing current estimated confirmation times for transactions based on different fee sizes.

This is the company’s first partnership with a broker in Europe, where it currently does not have a large presence. Bitcoin.com caught up with both Purse and Bity to learn more about the partnership. Also read: Purse and Unocoin Partner to ‘Drive Indian Bitcoin Adoption’ Prior to the partnership with Bity, Purse already has a few on-ramps to use for purchasing bitcoin. “We are partnered directly with Coinbase and Shapeshift which are integrated natively. And, we have exchange partnerships with Unocoin (India), Coinsecure(India), Coins.ph (Philippines), Airbitz, and Bitso (Latin America/Mexico) as well”, Purse Head of Growth and Product Content, Steven Mckie, told Bitcoin.com. According to the company’s latest data, the U.S. tops the list with 40 percent user base, followed by India, Venezuela, the United Kingdom, Brazil and Japan. The company hopes that the partnership with Bity will increase the number of users in Europe. Bity is a Swiss cryptocurrency broker which serves the majority of users in Switzerland, France, and Germany but operates throughout Europe. The exchange accepts both EUR and CHF. “By partnering, Purse can increase the number of on-ramps for individuals looking to purchase bitcoin in order to spend them on our unique service”, according to Purse’s announcement. All of Purse’s partners, including Bity, “each promote our e-commerce services either via in-wallet promotion to direct users to our service as an affiliate, or we use a GeoIP filtering modal that directs new users to our various partners as the go-to exchange to buy bitcoin in their particular region”, Mckie described. He added that: Cross promotion has already begun. An ad that says “Save 15% Off Amazon with Bitcoin. Purse.io and Bity.com together can help you save money on all your online purchases from Amazon” can be seen on the Bity account log in page. Alexis Roussel, Bity’s co-founder, shared with Bitcoin.com: “The whole Bity team are regular users of Purse. We were already recommending it and using it as a very good example of bitcoin usage. Partnering with Purse was definitely a no-brainer for us”. “Currently, we see our largest growth in Venezuela, Brazil, Philippines, and India,” Mckie said, adding that the company has more partnerships in the pipeline to expand into a few more key markets including more exchanges. More interest is found in “areas with economic uncertainty/currency volatility where bitcoin is the best hedge to protect wealth”, he further noted. Furthermore, he said: “Most of the users in emerging markets see Purse more as a utility than just a normal e-commerce site, and depend on our site as a means to live normally”.

2017-02-22T06:00:47-04:00,Washington State Bill to Ban Bitcoin for Pot Fails,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/washington-state-bill-ban-bitcoin-pot-fails/,"A possible ban on bitcoin for marijuana purchases in Washington State has failed, according to a source close to the matter, who wished to remain anonymous. SB 5264, the much-discussed ban on virtual currency for marijuana, failed to make it out of committee. Further, a Senator that brought the bill forward, most likely Senator Ann Rivers, has withdrawn her support of the bill after a hearing in the Washington State Senate highlighted Bitcoin’s positives, not its potential negatives. The bill to ban virtual currency use in the cannabis industry was brought forth by the founders of Payqwick, which some refer to as the “Paypal of Pot”.  It didn’t take long for their concerns to be downplayed by multi-state agencies and a company specializing in bitcoin payments for the marijuana industry. Related: A Cannabis Industry Icon Accepts Bitcoin Founders of Bitcoin point-of-sale service Posabit, as well as a lawyer from Perkins Coie, spoke against a virtual currency ban for cannabis businesses. “We just follow the Department of Financial Institutions lead on this issue,” said James Paribello, legislative liaison for the Liquor and Cannabis Board. “They have licensed businesses, [and] there are businesses licensed by us operating in this space and accepting and transacting through [bitcoin].” LCB had no concerns over Posabit. “We rely on the [Division of Financial Institutions] to make the call as to who can play in this space and since the DFI has said it’s okay, we’re okay,” said Mr. Paribello. The Senators, who had certain prejudices about Bitcoin, asked numerous questions about digital currency in general.  “When I read about Bitcoin on the international space, it’s talked about with international drug transactions, the black economy, a way to get around currency controls, a way government can track things and anonymity,” said Senator Michael Baumgartner, who came away from the hearing intrigued about Bitcoin’s ability to limit the amount of marijuana cash being transported by armored car in his state.  Perkins Coie lawyer Joseph Cutler argued: “Before we regulate currency [we] might want to understand how it works. What are the benefits? What does it do? It is a transparent, auditable transaction ledger. Every transaction done today is posted to that public ledger. This idea that it’s untraceable is simply false. People say Bitcoin is anonymous, that’s also false. We call Bitcoin pseudonymous, which is better than cash. In marijuana, cash is king, and there’s no traceability of customers for cash spent in marijuana stores. In virtual currency, that is not the case.” Cash is dangerous, suggested Posabit founder Ryan Hammond. “It’s dangerous to hold, dangerous to move, and you become a target of potential crimes.”  Posabit Chief Compliance Officer, John Baugher, echoed this concern:  “If law enforcement has questions about a certain transaction, and if they paid in cash, there is no way to answer this question.” The failed Washington State bill to ban bitcoin for pot received widespread press coverage before the hearing.

2017-02-21T19:00:00-04:00,The Far-Out Claims Behind Onecoin: The Self-Described ‘Bitcoin Killer’,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/onecoin-the-self-described-bitcoin-killer/,"As Onecoin “mastermind” Dr. Ruja Ignatov comes onto stage last year to deliver a speech called “The Blockchain”, fire is shot from the stage and fog machines are deployed as a big pop song proclaims its refrain – “this girl is on fire” – over and over. Those in attendance scream and applaud.  How did the founders of a ghostly cryptocurrency that is not even listed on the popular cryptocurrency ranking website Coinmarketcap, gain so much attention? Related: Buyer Beware! The Definitive OneCoin Ponzi Exposé “The English follow the principle that when one lies, it should be a big lie, and one should stick to it. They keep up their lies, even at the risk of looking ridiculous.” – Josef Goebbels A sense of urgency delivered in glossy speeches, and liberal use of superlative grammar (a popular practice with Ponzi schemes and dictators), have brought the fintech company much attention, and even provided smoke and mirrors for the more sinister aspects of the project.  “The company does not warrant that product descriptions or other content is accurate, complete, reliable, current, or error-free,” the terms of service on the Onecoin website reads. “The company reserves the right to, at any given time, change the Onecoin Compensation Plan.” Onecoin claims other cryptocurrencies can “never” be as successful as it has been. What makes it so great? “We keep our promises to people,” says Ms. Ignatov. Possibly due to questionable marketing techniques, one bitcoin billionaire recently stated that he does not promote Onecoin. “We can confirm that Sir Richard Branson does not endorse and does not have any association with Onecoin,” a Virgin Management spokesperson told Mirror.co.uk after a well-known Onecoin evangelist used a photo of Sir Branson making an “A-ok” sign with his hands, closely resembling Onecoin’s official hand gesture. The get-rich-quick scheme claims to have created 300 millionaires among its three million users. Onecoin evangelists sell the coin with religious zeal. Buy just a little and it will make you “filthy rich,” they claim. Obsessed with trash-talking Bitcoin, adherents claim their crypto-currency is kind of like Bitcoin, but more attractive to merchants. Onecoin, however, is not currently accepted by any merchants (except at Dealshaker, the company’s own ecommerce solution for its members) nor is it traded on cryptocurrency exchanges.  Still, Onecoin “has the potential to become the biggest cryptocurrency on the market,” reads a slide from the Kuala Lumpur version of the ‘Bitcoin Killer’ presentation.  “Only the biggest and best [cryptocurrencies] will survive,” says Ms. Ignatov, painting a picture of an arm’s race of cryptocurrency. For Onecoin supporters, Bitcoin contains a weakness. “Bitcoin cannot go aggressively into payment systems because they cannot do the transactions that they need to do,” Ms. Ignatov instructs. “Let’s say I have a small flower shop and want to take bitcoins. The customer needs to wait 10 minutes while the transaction is processed. Now, do you want to wait ten minutes to buy some flowers?”  The crowd ripostes loudly: “NO!”  This is why, according to Ms. Ignatov, Bitcoin is “not for the masses.” (Forget that Washington State merchants accept Bitcoin for a particular type of combustible flower, very popular globally). Onecoin planned to do this by “simply” retiring its original blockchain and mining coins on a blockchain that produces more onecoins. The switch to the new blockchain was completed in October 2016. “So we will switch off the website for a few hours,” Ms. Ignatova explained beforehand. “Switch off the old blockchain that runs currently at the back office, switch on the new blockchain, mine the coins in the first block, give them to your account and switch them on again.” She assures: “So, what this means for you, for us, for all of us, is first of all of course we can continue our expansion, our growth, and really make it number one worldwide.” Applause.  “We will make the wait list [to receive coins] very, very short – 3 to 6 days.” That’s compared with the current three-to-six month wait time. Ms. Ignatova announced Onecoin’s forthcoming IPO last month in a YouTube video. She claims the fintech company has done what “no other cryptocurrency has done.”  She declares: “Definitely Onecoin has been one of the biggest success stories out there. It’s time for us to go public and open up to the world.” And so, in the second quarter of 2018, Onecoin plans to be public on an as yet unnamed stock exchange in Asia, where it claims most of its members are located. She celebrates how Onecoin will be the first fintech cryptocurrency and ecommerce company listed on a stock exchange.  Once public, every coin holder becomes a shareholder, according to Onecoin. But, here’s where the sorcery comes into play. In order to be eligible for the IPO, to take place in fourteen months, one must first sell a ONE (Onecoin’s token) for an ‘OFC’, a Onecoin futures certificate. This entitles members to receive shares in the company Onecoin once public. “This is one of the most amazing promotions we are running,” Ms. Ignatova clarifies. She says anyone can double shares and thus their Onecoin holdings.  A Onecoin package ranges from the $100 Starter Package to $30,000 for a Special Combo Package. But this does not buy Onecoins per say, but, rather tokens which at a later date can be exchanged for Onecoins. Numerous inquiries by the Bitcoin.com team to Ruja Ignatov and Onecoin evangelists have thus far failed to receive replies. Bitcoin.com has done extensive research on Onecoin’s previous claims which can be found here and here.  An inquiry to Onecoin support asking for technical details behind the cryptocurrency’s blockchain, in which Bitcoin was mentioned, did receive a reply in broken English suggesting any Bitcoin questions be directed to ‘Bitcoin’s support team’.

On February 21 Nikita Smirnov vice president of the state-owned bank Vnesheconombank had some positive things to say about the digital currency bitcoin. In fact, Smirnov believes the Bitcoin network is the only “successful” blockchain technology. Also Read: Russia’s Relationship with Bitcoin May See Brighter Days Ahead Russia’s relationship with digital currencies has been confusing, to say the least. Over the past few years, a few Russian bureaucrats have perceived bitcoin use as a criminal activity. Moreover, in the past, there have also been website blockades against bitcoin domains such as BTC-e and Localbitcoins. However, it seems politicians and banks are slowly changing their minds towards the country’s relationship with bitcoin. Just recently Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister, Alexey Moiseev told the public that bitcoin was “not a threat,” and Russia’s largest bank Sberbank has also been bolstering blockchain technology. Now one of Russia’s well-known state banks Vnesheconombank (VEB) vice president has told the regional publication Kommersant that bitcoin has many benefits. Additionally, Nikita Smirnov says that bitcoin has an indisputable network effect. “Bitcoin is the only blockchain technology in the world that has widespread adoption,” explains Smirnov. “It has existed for several years already, people tried to hack it, but no one has succeeded. So right now, if you ask whether there’s another algorithm, which established itself as a solution to distributed consensus problem, then the answer is probably NO.”  Meanwhile, the Russian bank Sberbank has been researching and developing its own enterprise-grade distributed ledger prototype for quite some time. Sberbank CEO Herman Gref believes commercial blockchains will be ready in two years and the company is working with the government on this project. However, according to the VEB vice president bitcoin is really the only successful blockchain today and can be considered a positive bacteria in his opinion.      Vnesheconombank also works with the Russian government managing state debts and pension funds. The bank, instituted in 1922, has grown significantly over the past few years acting as a progressive “Russian Development Bank.” Smirnov’s opinion may not reflect the bank’s official stance towards bitcoin but may push the bank to research the cryptocurrency further. “[Bitcoin] truly is a new philosophical concept, which isn’t very well understood quite yet,” Smirnov concluded in his interview.

Mulvaney has shown the public his interest in Bitcoin and blockchain technology for quite some time. Also read: An Alliance Forms Under China’s New Bitcoin Regulations The Trump administration seems to be filling up with bureaucrats who are well-known bitcoin advocates. This includes household names like Travis Kalanick, Peter Thiel, and 21.co-CEO Balaji Srinivasan as a potential FDA director nominee, and now Mick Mulvaney as the director of the U.S. Office of Budget. The senate approved Mulvaney in a tight vote which resulted in a 51-to-49 vote in favor of Mulvaney being appointed as the new budget director. “With Mick at the head of OMB, my administration is going to make smart choices about America’s budget, bring new accountability to our federal government, and renew the American taxpayer’s trust in how their money is spent,” explained Trump during Mulvaney’s nomination. Mulvaney has participated in government committees concerning virtual currency regulation alongside helping Rep. Jared Polis (D-Colo.) and David Schweikert (R-Ariz.) with the launch of the bipartisan Congressional Blockchain Caucus. Additionally, Mulvaney has solicited bitcoin donations for his campaigns.  According to a speech obtained by the publication, Mother Jones Mulvaney told the John Birch Society that the Federal Reserve had “effectively devalued the dollar” and “choked off economic growth.” Mulvaney also explained to attendees that he was a fan of bitcoin and government manipulation would be nonexistent with cryptocurrency. At the Small Business Committee hearing on Bitcoin Mulvaney stated:      Bitcoin supporters hope the latest appointments made by the Trump administration will be favorable towards the cryptocurrency economy without stifling innovation. Mulvaney definitely takes keen interest in digital currencies and the underlying blockchain technology. When Coin Center revealed the initiation of the Congressional Blockchain Caucus with Representative Jared Polis, the South Carolina Republican had good things to say about this emerging technology.

Bitcoin-native Brave browser has recently integrated Webtorrent which could pull many consumers back to torrenting and potentially increase Bitcoin adoption. Also read: Brave Browser Finally Unleashes Bitcoin Micropayments  In 2008, Bittorrent traffic accounted for roughly one-third of the Internet’s bandwidth. By February 2013, it fell to a low of 3.35% worldwide. Meanwhile, video streaming operations like Netflix took its place. As of 2015, the behemoth video service accounted for 36.5% of all downstream North American Internet bandwidth during peak hours. Last year, DSLReports researchers noted that “the sharp climb in Netflix usage continues to coincide, rather un-coincidentally, with a notable drop in Bittorrent traffic”. The reason Netflix has gained Bittorrent’s market share is because “It’s convenient, it’s not that expensive, and the selection is just good enough”, reported Slate. A former Bittorrent user told the publication: “I’m happy to pay $8 a month for not-terrible selection and amazing convenience”. Webtorrent is a powerful new technology that allows web pages to stream Bittorrent content directly to the browser. Clicking on a torrent magnet link could open up an audio or video player and start streaming it right in the same window, just as if they had paid to watch a Netflix program. Brave CEO Brendan Eich first tweeted that he was “Excited about #webtorrent coming into Brave” in November. By the 18th, the new feature was added as a default extension but there was no official announcement about it. At first, there were a few bugs to sort out. However, today Webtorrent works well in Brave and can handle high-definition movies through the browser flawlessly, as tested by Bitcoin.com. Now, anyone with the latest version of Brave who clicks on a Bittorrent magnet link can now either download the file in question, or view/listen to it in their browser window.  Since convenience is reportedly one of the main factors that drove users from their Bittorrent clients to Netflix, the convenience of using the Brave Browser to torrent could also draw many consumers back to torrenting. Recently, Brave has been working on adding Chrome extensions to its platform. Soon they will be available, thereby removing one of the largest barriers to users switching from their existing browser over to Brave. The company has made no secret that they promote Bitcoin, and have even developed their own bitcoin micropayments system to help pay publishers and users alike, growing the bitcoin economy from both sides.

After the countryâs central bank implemented new regulatory inspections and policies a lot has changed for Chinese bitcoin exchanges. According to regional sources, a meeting took place between two Chinese bitcoin exchanges and financial authorities on February 17 with intentions to form an alliance to address regulatory issues. Additionally, Chinese bitcoin traders are finding alternatives amidst the regulatoryÂ confusion and exchange policy changes.Â  Also read:Â Call for a Digital Geneva Convention Could Affect Bitcoin The former vice-governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) XL Wu and other Chinese financial authorities have recently met with representatives from several large chinese bitcoin exchangesÂ to discuss compliance. The meeting at the Museum of Internet Finance saw representatives establish ways bitcoin exchanges can comply with Chinese regulations and form a regulatory partnership. Ten points were discussed on how bitcoin exchanges could meet the demands of regulators. According to the report, XL Wu added the tenth point, which may protect the privacy of bitcoin exchange users. The new proposed rules includes calls for the following;  Following the withdrawal suspensions, Chinese bitcoin traders have seemingly moved in great numbers to the peer-to-peer trading platform Localbitcoins. Volumes have quadrupled on Localbitcoins reaching the countryâs all-time-high. Furthermore, according to the regional publication 8BTC, Chinese high-frequency traders (HFT) are finding different avenues to exchange. The publication states that it is believed that roughly 80 percent of transactions were conducted by HFT traders on exchanges such as Huobi, Okcoin, and BTCC.  An HFT trader tells 8BTC that when the 0.03-0.2% trading fees commenced HFT traders had trouble adjusting and capturing a profit was âalmost impossible.â According to the report, many of these traders have moved into other markets such as foreign futures and Over-The-Counter (OTC) operations. According to our own sources in China, “Some of theÂ big high-frequency traders are doing OTC themselves too.” Additionally, 8BTC says the exchange BTCC indicatesÂ more bitcoin regulations may be on the way. Furthermore, bitcoin withdrawals from one exchange are slowly coming back online. On February 20th the smaller bitcoin exchange BTC123 announced it would be lifting its withdrawal suspension. However, the rules for withdrawals have changed, creating a slower process. According to sources users will be able to withdraw five btc or less overÂ a twelve hour time period, on BTC123. If the withdrawal exceeds five bitcoins, users must wait 48 hours for the request to be processed. So far no other bitcoin exchanges have announced lifting withdrawal suspensions.

2017-02-20T06:00:24-04:00,Call for a Digital Geneva Convention Could Affect Bitcoin,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/call-for-a-digital-geneva-convention-could-affect-bitcoin/,"Concerns about government-sponsored hackings, digital warfare, and an increasing number of malicious cyber attacks prompted tech giant Microsoft to call on governments for a Digital Geneva Convention. Presently, members of the Bitcoin community fear persecution in some countries. For example, Bitcoin miners and traders are being arrested in Venezuela. Therefore, the proposed Digital Geneva Convention should incorporate articles or protocols also to protect members of the Bitcoin community, as well as the free development of the cryptocurrency. Also read: Venezuelan Authorities are ‘Weakening’ Bitcoin Mining Operations Brad Smith, President, Microsoft, manages Microsoft’s external legal affairs, and he called for a Digital Geneva Convention, at the RSA Conference, San Francisco, CA, on February 14, 2017. Smith has been a key player in leading Microsoft’s efforts on privacy and security. As reported by Reuters, “Microsoft President Brad Smith on Tuesday pressed the world’s governments to form an international body to protect against nation-state hacking, saying recent high-profile attacks showed a need for global norms on police government activity in cyberspace.” Smith confirmed his appeal for a Digital Geneva Convention via Twitter declaring: “Needed: a Digital Geneva Convention to protect civilians on the internet, as the 1949 Geneva Conv. protects civilians in times of war.”  Smith in his appeal refers to the Fourth Geneva Convention, which added articles for the protection of civilians. This Convention was introduced in 1949. The purpose of Geneva Conventions is to protect vulnerable and defenseless individuals, during armed conflicts. According to Cornell University Law School: “The Geneva Conventions is a body of Public International Law, also known as the Humanitarian Law of Armed Conflicts, whose purpose is to provide minimum protections, standards of humane treatment, and fundamental guarantees of respect to individuals who become victims of armed conflicts.” Setting up the Digital Geneva Convention and then having the states ratify it will undoubtedly entail a substantial diplomatic effort. Incidentally, Denmark is planning to appoint its first Digital Ambassador. Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen has declared that given that Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and other technology giant corporations have reached importance and power of such magnitude that “they merit their own ambassador,” Politiken reported. If the Denmark’s digital ambassador becomes a reality, his or her job will certainly be to encourage technology corporations to increase investments in Denmark, as well as contribute to the advancement towards building a cashless society. Also, supporting Smith’s call for a Digital Geneva Convention might be a pertinent responsibility of the Digital Ambassador. Bitcoin is a technology-driven, borderless world currency. Bitcoin’s blockchain technology open-source code makes all transactions transparent, immutable and irrevocable. Changes in the blockchain cannot occur without being exposed. Bitcoin and its blockchain technology are decentralized, permissionless and trustless networks. All these features allow Bitcoin to be censorship resistant and resilient, capable of overcoming tremendous challenges, as demonstrated during its short existence. Nevertheless, members of the Bitcoin community are being persecuted and arrested. Specifically, the government of Venezuela has been shutting down significant mining operations as well as arresting Bitcoin miners and Bitcoin traders. Therefore, the call for a Digital Geneva Convention is consistent with the need to ensure the protection of the cryptocurrency from malicious cyber attacks and the Bitcoin community from oppressive governments, thus allowing the currency to strive and flourish in freedom.

2017-02-20T02:00:33-04:00,Bitcoin Freelance Marketplace Rein Launches in Beta,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-freelance-marketplace-rein-launches-beta/,"A peer-to-peer, bitcoin-only freelance marketplace called Rein has launched a beta version, bringing it one step closer to completion. The service could create a strong, uncensorable market for Bitcoiners to offer their skills online and earn a living in bitcoin. Also read: Openbazaar Integrates Tor – The Platform’s Most Requested Feature  Like Openbazaar, Rein has been designed as a decentralized software program that offers user ratings, a multisignature escrow solution, and TOR routing, while taking no fees from its users. Instead of selling products, however, Rein users sell services that were designed to be not censorable. The platform must be installed by both the freelancers and the clients offering jobs. Once they have done so, it works a lot like other popular freelance job boards such as Upwork, Peopleperhour, Toptal, and Simplyhired.  The new Rein version 0.3.0 beta was launched last week for Linux users. The instructions on how to install the program are, however, not newbie friendly. “The software has been through the command-line only stage”, developer David Sterry told Bitcoin.com, adding that it is now “seeing the first push with a GUI”, referring to the program’s new graphical interface. In addition, he said: Once installed, users will find that there are already some active listings with a few jobs completed. “Previously there have only been a handful of users, mostly centered around testing, and building Rein itself”, Sterry said. “A couple of programming jobs for Bitcoin software, a few for Rein itself, and some marketing gigs”. The jobs board offers many of the usual features found at a freelance jobs website, such as making a profile, posting jobs, browsing jobs, making bids, and accepting delivery, all with a built-in multisignature escrow system. As proof that the marketplace itself works, he noted that “Rein is, in fact, being used to accelerate building itself,” in his latest announcement. “All of the work for newest developments were done by working individually with 2 devs and 5 translators paid collectively 1.2 BTC.” The escrow works much like Openbazaar’s escrow, where moderators (called mediators in Rein) can become involved after a dispute arises. A set of 2-of-3 multisignature keys is always generated with every contract. Once both parties have chosen a mediator during a dispute, the mediator then gets the third multisignature key. Mediators charge their own pre-determined fee, typically around 1%, according to Sterry. He also noted that: The open source project also has a full TOR integration, allowing Freelancers, Clients, and Mediators all to use the site anonymously. Sterry has been working since late 2015 on the project and has kept the focus on decentralization and anonymity. There are no contractual obligations to the site or Sterry in any way. “Unlike many other platforms, we don’t impose any legal limits or requirements on our users,” he explained. Since the project is still in development, Sterry admitted that Rein isn’t yet fully decentralized, and is currently operating “using a couple of servers” at the core for now. However, he explained that “The software is designed to make use of any number of servers and anyone can run their own server to add to the decentralization of the network”. In addition, he pointed out that: However, the current lack of decentralization creates an opportunity for anyone who wants to run their own server to earn some coin. Sterry explained that “The software also includes basic payment processing so if anyone is interested to run a server they can charge for it”. In the new beta version, there are only a handful of jobs listed, but Sterry is confident that this will soon change. “My impression is that for the few people I’ve engaged, the income they earned working on Rein was significant for their own monthly budgets”, he detailed, adding that he doesn’t “think it’ll be long, probably this year,” when a full version is ready. By that time, most people already using bitcoins can install Rein and start earning a living. Sterry realizes, however, that the rest of the world will be dragging behind in adoption because they aren’t already a part of the Bitcoin economy. He believes that “For those who have bitcoin and have never hired anyone to do anything, Rein is a great way to get started leveraging their coins to accomplish their goals whatever they may be.” He further noted that: “We are working on a mobile app that should see its first release next quarter,” Sterry revealed. “Rather than native desktop apps, it’s more likely that we’ll make a Chrome extension or a client-side encrypted web application similar to Blockchain.info’s wallet.” Until then, the developer realizes that there is a long road ahead getting the word out. “The key challenge is showing potential clients the benefits of using bitcoin to pay for online work in the way Rein makes possible,” he described. However, he believes that if he can show them these benefits, the value proposition of a decentralized marketplace for labor that takes no fees will help market itself. He noted: What do you think of Rein? Let us know in the comments section below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock Bitcoin.com is a unique online destination in the bitcoin universe. Buying bitcoin?

2017-02-19T19:00:17-04:00,5 Ways Bitcoins Could Be Transferred to a Sidechain,Kyle Torpey,https://news.bitcoin.com/5-ways-bitcoins-transferred-sidechain/,"The idea of sidechains is something that has garnered a large amount of hype in the Bitcoin community ever since the concept was first publicly discussed in the media back in 2014. The creation of a sidechain essentially allows users to transfer bitcoin to and from other blockchains with different features. Examples of sidechains currently in development include RSK, which is an Ethereum-esque platform for more flexible smart contracts; MimbleWimble, which is an experimental method for improving privacy and scalability on the Bitcoin blockchain; and Bitcoin Hivemind, which is a blockchain-based prediction market platform. To “move” bitcoins from the main chain to a sidechain, the coins are first frozen on the main chain and then activated on the secondary chain; this is called a two-way peg. There are currently five well-known options when it comes to who or what should control the locked funds on Bitcoin’s main chain for these two-way peg mechanisms. Also read: Hivemind, Bloq Developer Paul Sztorc Discusses Bitcoin & Sidechains The simplest way to implement a two-way peg between Bitcoin and a sidechain is by sending the funds to a single custodian to hold on the main chain while the funds are active on the sidechain. The obvious problem here is that this is a completely centralized solution. In reality, having one party control the frozen funds sent to a sidechain wouldn’t be much different from simply depositing funds at bitcoin banks such as Coinbase or Xapo. In this way, you can view these bitcoin banks’ internal ledgers as sidechains to Bitcoin. If one centralized party is going to have complete control over the frozen funds, then it may be a better idea to extend the functionality of those funds via a centralized server rather than a new blockchain. Things get a bit more interesting when you replace the single custodian with a federation of notaries by way of a multisignature address. In this model, a federation of entities must sign-off on movements to and from the sidechain, so more parties must be compromised for a failure situation to unfold where the bitcoins frozen on the main chain are stolen. Blockstream recently released a whitepaper on “strong federations,” which is essentially their vision of a federated two-way peg system. Liquid is a sidechain created by Blockstream that uses the strong federations model. The sidechain is used to transfer bitcoins between centralized bitcoin institutions, such as exchanges, at a faster pace than the public Bitcoin blockchain. One of the main selling points of the single custodian and federation models is that they do not require any further changes to the Bitcoin protocol.  The SPV sidechain is the original vision of the decentralized two-way peg as outlined in the original sidechains whitepaper. An SPV sidechain uses SPV proofs to move bitcoins to and from the Bitcoin sidechain. An SPV proof is a way to prove the existence of a transaction in a block via a small amount of data related to that transaction’s existence in a particular block. In other words, an SPV sidechain moves bitcoins between the main chain and the sidechain after receiving proof that a transaction signaling for the movement of some bitcoin between the two chains has been mined in a block. To be enabled, SPV sidechains require a soft-forking change to Bitcoin. Unlike the other two-way peg mechanisms discussed in this article, SPV sidechains do not give direct control of real bitcoins on the main chain to a custodian; however, the ability for a majority of miners to produce and build upon fraudulent SPV proofs gives them indirect control over the funds, including the ability to send to themselves. Having said that, there are ways to mitigate this issue.  A drivechain is an alternative to the sidechain vision outlined in the original whitepaper. In a drivechain, miners signal the current state of a sidechain. In other words, the miners are essentially the custodian of funds, and they’re able to unfreeze funds for users who wish to move their coins back to the main chain. The drivechain concept was developed by Paul Sztorc, who is an economist at Bloq and the creator of Bitcoin Hivemind. One of the key tenets of drivechains is that miners are the least problematic custodians of funds being used on a sidechain from a game theory perspective. According to Sztorc, drivechains can be structured in a way in which any theft of coins frozen on the mainchain would obviously be orchestrated by miners.  “Such brazen theft would indicate [1] that Bitcoin would be (in the near future) without sidechains of any kind, and [2] that Bitcoin itself may be in danger from the miners (and we may need to consider using an alternate proof-of-work hash function),” he explained the impact of this setup in his original post on the topic. Like SPV sidechains, drivechains require a soft-forking change to Bitcoin. Combinations of the aforementioned methods of achieving a two-way peg are also possible. For example, a concept explored by RSK Labs is the combination of a drivechain with the federation model. In other words, both the miners and members of a federation will have to sign-off on a movement of funds from the sidechain back to the main Bitcoin blockchain. As mentioned previously, a drivechain requires a soft-forking change in Bitcoin, so RSK currently uses a federation-only model. Although a federation will be used in conjunction with the drivechain model, the federation’s role in the RSK blockchain will no longer be necessary once (if) 90 percent of Bitcoin miners have decided to merge-mine RSK. Another idea similar to the concept of sidechains is called extension blocks. Much like sidechains, extension blocks allow users to opt-in to blocks of transactions with different validation rules. The key difference between a traditional sidechain and an extension block is that upgraded Bitcoin full nodes validate the transactions on the extension block. This means that the extension block is tied much more closely to the main Bitcoin network than a traditional sidechain. The level of separation between extension blocks and the Bitcoin network is almost non-existent, which means issues on extension blocks are more likely to cause issues for the entire Bitcoin network. With sidechains, there is a layer of separation between two blockchains, which means the main chain can be protected from issues on the sidechain. For this reason, it’s likely that more experimental ventures, such as RSK, will be implemented as a sidechain rather than extension blocks. Recently, Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau posted an early version of a BIP draft for effectively increasing Bitcoin’s block size limit through the use of extension blocks. Since extension blocks can be implemented via soft forks, the features of the extension blocks are essentially opt-in for users. Even in the case of extension blocks with a larger block size limit, users are not forced to upgrade and validate or propagate blocks that are much larger in size. Those who wish to enjoy the level of decentralization offered by 1MB blocks can continue to do so, while those who would like to experiment with much larger block size limits can do so on an opt-in basis. Although users are able to opt-in to extension blocks, miners must upgrade to continue mining valid blocks on the main chain. Soft-forked sidechains are similar to extension blocks, with the key difference being that soft-forked sidechains are merge-mined rather than mined as part of the main Bitcoin blockchain. This article is largely based on a recent presentation by RSK Labs Chief Scientist Sergio Lerner on Zeppelin’s YouTube channel and conversations the author had with Blockstream CEO Adam Back.

Furthermore, in just over a month, in spite of Greek capital control restrictions, citizens have withdrawn 2.5 billion euros from regional banks. The turbulent economy in Greece may once again cause more demand for bitcoin as a safe haven. Also read: 10,000+ EU ATMs to Cash Out Bitcoin  Greek citizens are only allowed to withdraw 1,800 euro per month due to capital control restrictions. However, the country’s capital flight policies have not stopped a vast amount of Greek residents from taking their funds out of the banks this past month. Throughout the years of economic depression surrounding Greece, bitcoin has become a widely suggested alternative currency for the country’s citizens. Demand stemming from the neighboring Republic of Cyprus’s debt problems had seemingly caused a spike in bitcoin’s price in 2013. In July 2015, the infamous Grexit also may have spurred demand for the cryptocurrency. During the 2015 summer Grexit, bitcoin’s fiat value went from a low of US$225 per bitcoin to a high of $309. At the time, foreign lenders and Greek authorities continued to have problems maintaining the country’s volatile economy. Certain banks closed, ATMs were inoperable, and credit cards were shut off, alarming Greek citizens. During the Grexit crisis, Bitcoin proponents began enticing Greeks to join the Bitcoin economy. Thanos Marinos, the founder of the bitcoin exchange BTCGreece, said demand had risen by 400 percent. Other companies, such as Coinbase, waived fees that month for Europeans and crypto-exchange Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees asked the Bitcoin community to send small transactions to Greek citizens. Furthermore, Coinbase noted at the time that even though Greek users were unable to use their platform, they saw a large spike in demand from surrounding European countries.  According to the publication Eidiseis, the latest spike in Greek withdrawals has shaken up the regional banking community. The publication’s sources say that the Union of Greek Banks believes that “time is not working in their favor.” Citizens once again may pivot back to storing wealth in homes, safes, mattresses, and possibly convert it to alternative currencies like bitcoin. There are few options for Greeks to learn about the decentralized money and obtain bitcoins. Localbitcoins is fully operational in Greece and prices are currently thirty dollars higher than bitcoin’s global average. Alongside this, there is a regular Bitcoin Meetup group in Athens and the city has two Bitcoin ATMs as well. So far, worldwide economic turbulence in countries like Venezuela, India, Britain, and Italy has added more demand for Bitcoin’s benefits. The deadlock between Greece and creditors doesn’t seem to be going away anytime soon and citizens like Greek farmers are growing tired of austerity measures. The possibility of Greeks and citizens within neighboring countries finding solace in the digital currency’s store of value is probable. Moreover, digitally storing bitcoins securely is probably far safer than storing euros under the mattress. Do you think this economic crisis could spur more Greeks towards Bitcoin?

The proposed Bitcoin scaling solution will supposedly offer an upgrade to 100 Transactions Per Second (tps) without raising the block size or risking a hard fork. Also read: Following a Day of Delays, Lukejr Proposes to Decrease the Block Size  Lumino takes a whole new approach to scaling Bitcoin, according to RSK’s (Rootstock’s) co-founder and Chief Scientist Sergio Demián Lerner, who is in charge of the project. In early January, during bitcoin’s steep rise to the year-to-date high, while all eyes were on the price charts, Lerner unveiled the project for the first time, tweeting that “I’m working on a new approach to scalability on PoW-based blockchains. Allows 5K tps over home PCs. Very exciting! Soon I’ll publish!” At that time, he considered the yet-unnamed project just a sidechain for Bitcoin on the RSK platform. “Can this be used for #Bitcoin?”, a Twitter user asked him. Lerner replied: “As a sidechain, yes. As a hard-fork or soft-fork, it would require a lot of work. Our plan at @RSKsmart is a Bitcoin sidechain”. Lerner told Mooti CEO Bradley Chun: “It’s something truly different, looks like hub-and-spoke net, but in the background something different happens”. Over the last month, the Rootstock Chief Scientist has been leaking hints about Lumino from his twitter feed, and early this week, he tweeted: Since Lerner’s announcement, many people have asked him for access to the white paper. However, he did not publicly respond to those requests and has been quiet about who the reviewers are. Earlier this month, Lerner tweeted that 100 tps was demonstrated at blockchain developer conference Construct, which ran the last two days of January in San Francisco. In his tweet, he wrote: At Bitcoin’s current 3 to 7 tps, Lumino’s proposed 100 tps represents approximately 33 to 14 times more transactions in each block than Bitcoin currently allows, and 6 to 14 times more than it could have after a hard fork to two-megabyte blocks. To accomplish this feat, Lerner explained that he has found a way to store all the information of a transaction inside a tiny amount of space, cramming that many transactions inside a single megabyte block. He also confirmed that Lumino does not require Segwit. Earlier this week, he tweeted: 64 bits of data is far smaller than each transaction is in a current block, which has somewhere between 18 bytes and several hundreds of bytes per transaction, depending on the number of input and output addresses that the transaction has. So even with the smallest transaction possible, the amount of space it would take up inside a block could be reduced significantly using Lumino. On Saturday, Lerner’s latest hint addressed the long-term scaling solution by offering the possibility of scaling up to 20,000 tps with Lumino. He tweeted:  He also mentioned in another tweet that “Lumino is better as a sidechain of Bitcoin (@RSKSmart) to get 10 seconds confirmations, but could be also a Bitcoin soft-fork”.

2017-02-18T12:00:47-04:00,Falling GBTC Premium Indicates Market Expects SEC to Approve Bitcoin ETFs,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/falling-gbtc-premium-indicates-market-expects-secs-approve-bitcoin-etfs/,"Next month, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has to make a couple of decisions regarding bitcoin ETFs. While three of them are pending approval, the third, Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT), is many months away. As the deadlines for the first two bitcoin ETFs draw near, the BIT’s premium has fallen significantly, indicating that the market may be expecting the Commission to approve a bitcoin ETF soon. Also read: Needham’s Insights Into Factors Affecting SEC’s Decision on Bitcoin ETFs  BIT is an open-ended trust sponsored by Grayscale Investments available to accredited investors. Trading under the symbol GBTC on the OTCQX market, it is invested exclusively in bitcoin. Its annual fee is 2 percent, and at the end of January, it has $165.64 million assets under management. BIT shares also have a one-year hold period before they are “eligible to become unrestricted and resold in the public market”, wrote Grayscale, citing the SEC Rule 144. GBTC typically trades at a substantial premium to its Net Asset Value (NAV). Its NAV per share tracks the price of bitcoin and is calculated daily. Its market price per share is the closing price of BIT shares on the OTCQX market. According to Needham & Company which provides investment analysis of GBTC, there are several reasons why GBTC trades at large premium. “Some investors prefer or require that their investments are registered securities – which means that holding bitcoin directly is a nonstarter for at least some subset of investors”, Needham explains in its latest ETF report. Other reasons include avoiding the risk of handling bitcoin themselves and the complexity and hassle of dealing with bitcoin exchanges, Needham further details, adding that there are also investors who just don’t realize they are overpaying for the associated amount of bitcoin. The number of bitcoin per GBTC share is 0.09350819. As of February 17, GBTC’s market price per share is $108 and its NAV price per share is $97.96. Recently, GBTC premium over its NAV has fallen significantly, which indicates that the market may be expecting the SEC to approve a bitcoin ETF soon. Needham wrote: Contrary to what the market may be signaling, Needham estimates that the chance of the SEC approving a bitcoin ETF is less than 25 percent. While citing that speculations of an ETF approval may be a major factor driving GBTC premium down, the firm also mentioned other factors. For example, some investors who bought the shares a year ago may be selling them and “take whatever premium still remains to avoid the risk that the premium disappears entirely in the case of ETF approval”, Needham wrote.

2017-02-18T06:00:58-04:00,Yours Updates Reveal Many Ways to Earn Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/yours-updates-earn-bitcoin/,"Yours is a long-awaited social media platform that promises to pay users bitcoin for different types of content. Long hailed as a potential killer app for bitcoin, Yours will have the ability for anyone anywhere in the world to start earning bitcoin with nothing more than an internet connection. As the project approaches its launch date, more details have recently been released on its website and from CEO Ryan X. Charles. Also read: ‘Yours Network’ to Use Bitcoin in Competition Against Steemit  Yours’ biggest reveal recently has been the many types of revenue models that content
creators will have access to. At least six models have been detailed, but only two of them will be available at launch. The first model allows creators to place paywalls inside their content. Article, story, video, or image formats were mentioned on the site. In each case, the poster could choose how much of the story is tucked away behind the paywall and how much readers would be charged to see it. The second model is the classic endorsement model which lets content creators earn as users pay to upvote their content. Revenue is split in half between the content creator and those who made early endorsements of their content by upvoting. If the early voters pick good articles that earn more later, they too will earn from the content. Meanwhile, downvoters can also earn through ‘short-selling’ when a piece of content is unpopular. The third model pays readers to see ads, which would show up as black boxes beside the content with a price on them. If the reader clicks on the box, they get the money listed for viewing the ad. The fourth model pays commenters when other readers upvote good comments. Content creators set a price for comments below their post upfront, and commenters can out-bid each other for the top spot. The fifth model is a content investment model which allows content owners to set an amount for investment beside their content. Anyone can then invest in the content by clicking a button beside it to get a cut of that content’s revenue over time. The last model centers around user-created subcommunities. Similar to how Reddit works, niche-focused communities can be created inside Yours that let the owners earn on upvotes and pay moderators a percentage for doing a great job curating the content there. Charles’ inspiration for creating Yours was the fact that facebook, Reddit, and all other social media websites get rich without creating any content of their own. Users create all the content, but since they do not have an incentive to make good content, bad content often rises to the top, such as spam and trolling. Ads are also intrusive and predominant. Now that bitcoin allows users on the internet to directly monetize good content, Charles believes this is one problem we no longer have to put up with. He told Bitcoin.com: The CEO is confident that the platform he is creating will do a great job of attracting some of the best content on the web. Charles explained that his upcoming social network “absolutely will compete with Facebook” in the long-term, although he’s “not so ambitious as to think we will seriously compete with Facebook in 2017.” Since Bitcoin’s network fees can be even larger than the size of the average payment that users earn in the Yours community, Charles has spent the last nine months developing a bona-fide fee-free, decentralized micropayment solution and the resulting wallets for use on the Yours platform. Configured much like the upcoming Lightning Network, Yours uses only bitcoin to make tiny payments across the community, and at no point does the company hold onto anyone’s bitcoin. The payment network and wallet are both now complete, Charles reports on his website, and in a recent video he shows off the micropayments wallet inside the Yours platform.  The fully-functional wallet denominates bitcoins in bits, or one millionth of a bitcoin. There is no installation. The wallet and the whole Yours platform live within the browser like a self-installing plugin. Charles mentioned that there will be a quick-buy button later for people to get small amounts of bitcoin into their wallet from their local currency. Once open, authors on Yours will be able to sign up for free and start earning bitcoin right 
away, Charles explained. Even if they have never used bitcoin before, new users can show up to the site, get their first bitcoin wallet, and create or interact with content there to start earning immediately. This will be even easier later as more revenue models are introduced. Until then, there will be plenty of content creators testing out the site. Charles said: As for the launch date, Charles was careful to not give an estimate, only saying it’ll be “ASAP”. He did, however, note that the infrastructure is done and he’s now focused on testing. “We will launch as soon as our early preview users tell us the app is good enough to launch,” he said.

2017-02-17T01:00:09-04:00,Global Cannabis Seed Banks Are Accepting Bitcoin,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/cannabis-seed-banks-accepting-bitcoin/,"“What has really struck us is the way the global cannabis community has banded together using the power of the internet,” says a Royal Queen Seeds representative who prefers to simply go by Alex. “Before, people had to rely on friends, local growers, and trial-and-error to learn and grow. The internet has created a platform for everyone to share techniques and ideas, as well as easily obtain new genetics to try out.”  The company’s mission has always been to bring an eclectic mix of cannabis genetics to growers across the world. The internet and Bitcoin has allowed the company to reach a much wider audience. Related: Washington State Liquor and Cannabis Board OK with Bitcoin for Pot “Bitcoin allows our customers to pay with a digital currency not tied to any one country,” Alex explained. “It provides a safe and secure alternative payment method that has proven immensely popular, especially by those concerned about privacy. Once set up, bitcoins are extremely easy to use, and it has become the preferred choice of payment for many of our customers.” Cannabis seed websites have been around for many years. Royal Queen Seeds came online around April 20, 2008. Founded in the Netherlands, the company launched its own line of cannabis seeds after years in the business. It has gone on to produce many Highlight Cup and High Times Cannabis Cup award winners, including classic strains like White Widow, Shining Silver Haze, Northern Light and Amnesia Haze. “Starting up the Royal Queen Seeds website was a labor of love and passion – as cheesy as it sounds,” says Alex.  After years in the business, Royal Queen Seeds has seen cannabis become more widely accepted by the general population, especially in Spain. “It is leading to changes in cannabis laws, as evidence and reason overtake fear-mongering,” Alex said. “This has shaped the industry in so many ways. It is still early days, but the industry has become a lot more accessible – with people moving away from buying off the black market to growing their own supply in their backyard. This makes things safer and more prosperous for everyone.” Royal Queen Seeds has recently started selling seeds in Canada and plans to begin selling in the United States directly to consumers, as well. “Things are moving forward with legalization movements making progress across the world,” he told Bitcoin.com. “It has spurred on genetic experimentation like never before in cannabis.” Royal Queen Seeds have recently produced two all-new CBD focused auto-flowering cannabis strains, Stress Killer Automatic and Fast Eddy Automatic. What does this mean? “Those who want to create their own crop of CBD-rich bud don’t need to be pro-growers,” he said. “They can plant a seed or two in their back garden and get a personal harvest of CBD-rich weed, growing multiple crops a year.” Royal Queen Seeds is not the only seed bank accepting digital currency.  The UK-based Attitude Seed Bank accepts bitcoin and has become known for its giveaways to bitcoiners. Bitcoinseedstore.com only accepts cryptocurrencies (such as Dash, Litecoin and Potcoin), with similar offerings as the seed banks above.

2017-02-16T19:00:00-04:00,Luis Buenaventura Highlights ‘Bitcoin’s Strongest Use Case’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/luis-buenaventura-bitcoins-strongest-use-case/,"Many people believe global remittance will be Bitcoin’s killer application. This week Bitcoin.com spoke with Luis Buenaventura, remittance expert and Chief Technology Officer at Bloom Solutions, concerning using Bitcoin within the remittance market. We discuss Bitcoin’s possibilities within the billion dollar remittance industry and the recent regulations in the Philippines.   Buenaventura has studied the subject of utilizing Bitcoin with remittances extensively and has written a book called “Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin” on his research collected since 2014. Bitcoin.com (BC): So how did you originally get involved with Bitcoin and remittance services? Luis Buenaventura (LB): I’ve been building tech startups in the Philippines for over a decade now, and one of my earlier companies was an ecommerce marketplace that failed because there wasn’t enough local credit card usage to make the business model work. Bitcoin seemed like an interesting alternative payment mechanism at the time, and although I still believe that it could be the case, I’m a little more realistic about how long it might take for people to really get into it.   Eventually, it became apparent that Bitcoin’s strongest use case was probably remittances – at least in countries like the Philippines – and I’ve been focusing on that exclusively since 2014. BC: When did you begin to heavily research the subject of Bitcoin remittance strategies and global startups? The remittance problem has been the core focus of the last three years for me, and naturally, a lot of my knowledge has come from interacting with other startups and founders who are working in the same space. The amount of knowledge and data I’ve collected is very much the sum of the work of many others. BC: In your book “Reinventing Remittances with Bitcoin” you say a small Bitcoin startup will not be able to overthrow current remittance incumbents at this stage. Can you tell our readers why this is the case? There are a lot of factors here, but I think the biggest is that trust takes a long time to build. Acquiring customers from different cultures and different languages is not straightforward, and apart from the Korea/Philippines corridor, I’ve not seen many other examples with great traction. I should emphasize that I’m not saying it will never happen, but it will take a lot more time and resources than many young startups currently have access to. BC: What is a “last mile” remittance service? Bitcoin remittance startups can be classified into a few distinct types: first mile, last mile, or end-to-end. First mile remittance services focus on acquiring customers in the sending countries, but don’t actually have any presence in the receiving countries. They rely on other businesses – the last mile startups – who handle the actual disbursement and support the beneficiary customers on that end of the transaction. Then there are the end-to-end services which manage both sides of the transaction. That’s a much more challenging model to pull off because you’re learning how to acquire customers on one end, while struggling against the nuances of an under-developed banking infrastructure on the other. BC: At this stage how do you think governments and regulators are handling Bitcoin remittance services? In the Philippines, it’s now obvious that the government views Bitcoin primarily as a cross-border value transfer mechanism, based on how they’ve written their recent legislation. I suppose you could say that the People’s Bank of China has similar views, although they’ve chosen to focus on capital flight instead of its positive impact on migrant worker remittances the way we have. Because of this, they’ve taken extra aggressive steps to try to curb some of Bitcoin’s capabilities. I can’t speak for other countries, but here in Manila, at least, I think that getting the conversation started was an important first step. Now it’s on the local Bitcoin community to make sure that the tone stays friendly and that we keep customer benefits and security at the center of the discussion. BC: What did you think when Western Union invested in the Digital Currency Group?   Well, it certainly makes sense, and I’m sure they viewed it as a hedge to ensure they always had a close eye on the industry. Having met VPs from Western Union, Moneygram, and RIA, I can say that they’re all aware of Bitcoin and blockchain technology, and are obviously not going to stand by idly and wait for their whole industry’s demise. The question really is, how will they adapt to the new possibilities that Bitcoin opens up? That’s still unclear. BC: What is the Bloom Network?  The Bloom network is a loosely-coupled network of blockchain-based partners that we work with around the world to form our various remittance corridors. BC: Can you explain why you believe Bitcoin is terrible at the moment as a currency but good for settlement?  Bitcoin is good for two things at the moment: long-term speculation and instant settlement. Unfortunately, volatility is a by-product of price discovery, so it’s difficult for people to use it for their daily expenses. However, because it’s relatively quick to send bitcoin from one wallet to another, it means we can use it to settle debts in real-time. The catch is that the receiving party needs to be able to liquidate it for fiat currency fairly quickly as well, in order to avoid potential volatility pitfalls. BC: Can you tell our readers why price trends don’t affect Bitcoin remittance startups? The instant-settlement, instant-liquidation workflow that’s described in the book avoids volatility risk by never taking a long bitcoin position. In theory, a rising or falling bitcoin price should have little effect on a Bitcoin remittance startup as they don’t hold the cryptocurrency for a long enough period of time. BC: In your opinion how long do you think it will take for Bitcoin to make a dent in the global remittance market? It’s tough to say. There’s a version of our future where people will just bypass remittance companies completely and go peer-to-peer via Bitcoin, and I think that’s the future anticipated by the Philippines’ new guidelines. The other possibility is that we’ll continue to rely on remittance companies in some form (whether physical or digital) to act as on- or off-ramps, but those transactions will be settled in the background via the blockchain. I tend to believe that this is the more likely of the two scenarios, because the migrant workers who traditionally benefit the most from cost savings are also the ones who are least likely to trust a virtual form of money with no government backing it. The latter scenario is where we’re at right now, and if it continues at this pace, there’s no reason not to expect a few hundred million USD being settled through the Bitcoin blockchain annually, within the next two years. That’s still less than 1% of the world’s remittance market, but hey, we gotta start somewhere. What do you think about the current Bitcoin remittance environment? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-02-16T10:00:52-04:00,Qtum’s Patrick Dai Talks Smart Contracts and Bitcoin Security,Bitcoin.com,https://news.bitcoin.com/smart-contracts-bitcoin-security-interview-qtums-patrick-dai/,"Bitcoin.com recently covered the blockchain project Qtum that mixes the Bitcoin protocol with the Ethereum Virtual Machine in order to enhance smart contracts. We chatted with Patrick Dai, co-founder of Qtum, for more technical information. Dai gives our readers the inside scoop on what this project entails and its goal to create a new blockchain economy.  Also Read: How Bitcoin Apps Help People Survive Emerging Market Volatility Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers about the Qtum Foundation and the Qtum concept in simple terms? Patrick Dai (PD): The Qtum Project combines Bitcoin Core 0.13, the Ethereum Virtual Machine to execute smart contracts and Proof-of-Stake as the consensus mechanism. The Qtum Foundation, which is headquartered in Singapore, is the organizational body that oversees the development of the Qtum Project. Qtum brings the best of both worlds together, since we can easily implement any Bitcoin Improvement Proposals (BIPs) to Qtum and Ethereum DAPPs can also be ported to Qtum. BC: Why did you design a protocol that uses the Bitcoin client 0.13, and the Ethereum Virtual Machine? PD: Bitcoin Core is the most stable blockchain codebase to date, it has proven itself over eight years, and the security of its code is trusted with an accumulated market capitalization of over 16 billion dollars. The Qtum Project combines Bitcoin Core with Ethereum by enabling the EVM to operate on the UTXO model through Qtum’s Account Abstraction Layer The Qtum project has extended the Bitcoin script by adding three opcodes. This provides an environment the Ethereum Virtual Machine can operate in, and do so within the parameters of an UTXO environment. One may ask, ‘Why is this necessary when the end result is a successful smart contract execution?’ The answer is ‘parallelism.’ The current Ethereum structure takes a linear approach to Smart Contract execution. Reinventing the wheel, when a flexible solution already exists, seems like an industry regression. Although Qtum is a hybrid solution, we wanted to avoid a situation where we merged two codebases that weren’t compatible. The vast resources available for the UTXO projects – like Bitcoin, Litecoin and others – can easily be modified to work with Qtum’s blockchain. Plus, the ability to implement BIPs was a ‘must-have.’ We believe that the sum of all transactions is what makes up the blockchain. We wanted to avoid a situation where virtual transactions result in two block explorers showing different results for one transaction, as some would be virtually untraceable. The UTXO platform will not allow this, and we also get the security benefits like “Pay 2 script hash” (BIP16), native multi-signatures, protection from double spend attacks, and reduction in the threat of having to fork. This is only scratching the surface on why we chose the best platform to build on. It is cost-effective to implement the Ethereum Virtual Machine, because of the money spent developing it. We can focus on other core features, and dedicate resources to improve the sustainability of our project. BC: Do you feel smart contracts will be more popular in the near future?  PD: I think we will see a lot of businesses automate their processes with blockchain smart contracts. A multitude of industries have explored blockchain technology over the last few years, and we believe with the Qtum platform they will be able to move from proof-of-concept to implementation quicker. Once businesses adopt blockchain smart contracts, we will then see more consumer applications of the technology. BC: Can you explain what a ‘Master Contract’ is? PD: Designed to be flexible for the mainstream business industry, Master Contracts are ‘off-chain’ agreements that make use of oracles and data feeds. This feature will be designed for certain use cases, bringing a new concept to the blockchain industry, and changing the way contract lifecycle management is handled. BC: Your team recently got backing from a prominent member of the cryptocurrency space. Can you tell our readers about this?  PD: Qtum received backing from Roger Ver, the first investor in blockchain startups. Roger is a visionary, he saw the potential of Bitcoin before almost everyone, and he bet big on it. This gives us a lot of validation for our project. We believe our contributions will benefit the blockchain community as a whole and illustrate that innovation is the key to growing. We also have the support of Anthony Di Iorio, an Ethereum founder; Bo Shen, Managing Partner of Fenbushi Capital; Xu Star, the CEO of OkCoin; as well as Chen Wei Xing, founder of Kuaidi, which merged with Didi and others. BC: Why is Qtum designed with a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) mechanism? PD: There are so many reasons to implement a staking consensus model, and we considered this carefully when designing the Qtum architecture. Our lead developer Jordan Earls created a new proof-of-work algorithm in the past, so we spent some time discussing if this was the path we wanted to take. Should a network offer ASIC resistance to fend off centralization of the hashing power or not?  In all of our talks to businesses, maintaining the network through proof-of-work mining was a real concern. They asserted that efficiencies of blockchain technology shouldn’t be undermined by the inefficiencies of mining. Industry users don’t spend an excessive amount of time learning how proof-of-work systems operate. The more we delved into the topic with financial institutions, logistics providers, manufacturers, the argument for a proof-of-stake consensus model became more obvious. The proof-of-stake consensus model makes a strong case for adoption in the Proof-of-Stake whitepaper. They list some potential threats that Sunny King’s original protocol could be vulnerable to, and offer more incentive for people to secure the network. The fact that this system rewards users who actively stake, opposed to those who just keep their coins on an exchange, or build up coin age to stake in bursts. In short, the reason we adopted proof-of-stake is the fact that it’s an efficient and secure consensus algorithm. BC: Can you explain what ‘Sparknet’ is? PD: “Sparknet” is the fruit of our labor. It’s a fully working testnet of the Qtum Core technology. This is where we merge Bitcoin Core v0.13 with proof-of-stake and the Ethereum Virtual Machine. This is only possible by making changes to Bitcoin Core’s scripting language and adding an “Account Abstract Layer.” While these Qtum tokens will just be used for testing, they will be a great way to showcase our technology while we look for bugs before the main network is launched. We plan to release Sparknet within a couple of months of the crowdsale. BC: How will Qtum avoid smart contract bugs and exploits, such as the recent DAO incident?  PD: We will try to avoid these smart contract bugs through two approaches. We will introduce the formal semantics method to verify the completeness and veracity of one smart contract, so before the contract has been deployed on blockchain, we can prevent some bugs. Also, Qtum aims to establish a smart contract hub, offering secure and thoroughly tested contract templates, tailor fit for a multitude of industries, such as supply chain management, telecommunications, IoT, social networking, and more. BC: What’s the ultimate goal of the Qtum Foundation?  PD: We recently released a 32-page governance document called: “The Qtum Blockchain Economy Whitepaper.” In the Economy Whitepaper, we go in depth and discuss how the ultimate goal of the Foundation is to become irrelevant, giving the community full control of the project after four years. The goal of the Qtum Foundation is to assist getting the Qtum Project off the ground and ensuring that the project has sound management. The goal of the Foundation is not to control the project, but to aide it in its infancy. What do you think about the Qtum project? Let us know in the comments below.  Disclaimer: Roger Ver, CEO of Bitcoin.com, is a Qtum investor.   Images courtesy of Patrick Dai, Qtum, and Shutterstock.  What’s the quickest way to see the current bitcoin price in your local currency?

2017-02-16T01:00:17-04:00,A Closer Look at How and Why Bitcoin is Traded P2P in Russia and Venezuela,Kyle Torpey,https://news.bitcoin.com/closer-look-bitcoin-traded-p2p-russia-venezuela/,"Localbitcoins saw a roughly 85 percent increase in global volume over the course of 2016, and the growth seen by this bitcoin trading platform was seen equally in both the developed and developing world—albeit for different reasons. While the need for increased privacy and the avoidance of Know Your Customer regulations is known to be the driving force behind Localbitcoins and other forms of P2P trading volume in the developed world, much less is known about Localbitcoins’s popularity in places like Russia and Venezuela. To get a better idea of why Localbitcoins saw so much growth in these two particular areas of the world, Bitcoin.com reached out to bitcoin users on the ground who are familiar with the activities in these particular countries. Also read: Following the PBOC Exchange Shakeup China’s Localbitcoins Volume Surges Venezuela saw greater growth in Localbitcoins trading volume than any other country in the world in 2016. Although there were only around 25 bitcoins traded per week via Localbitcoins in Venezuela at the beginning of 2016, there were ten times that amount being traded per week by the end of the year. This number is even more impressive when considering the fact that the bitcoin price more than doubled during the year, which means growth was 900 percent in US dollar terms. According to sources within the country, SEBIN, which is basically Venezuela’s secret police, has been targeting bitcoin users and miners, including Surbitcoin employees, and threatening them with jail time if they do not pay bribes. “I know of a close acquittance that got the shackles because he was mining,” an anonymous member of the Bitcoin community in Venezuela told Bitcoin.com. Although Surbitcoin’s volume numbers were still greater than the visible alternatives at the end of the year, the exchange recently had their bank account revoked, which has led to a spike in trading on Localbitcoins and other P2P options. In addition to Localbitcoins, a lot of trading activity also takes place via Facebook, Telegram, and amongst friends. Since cash is basically non-existent in Venezuela at this time, most of these trades happen by way of bank transfers. Although it may seem unwise to make these sorts of trades via trackable bank transfers, a source in Venezuela claims the amount of legal commerce conducted via bank transfers makes this financial transparency a non-issue. “Heck, I even buy weed with bank transfers,” claimed the anonymous source. Of course, many Venezuelans would prefer to get paid directly in bitcoin rather than having to exchange bolivars for it. Bitcoin mining is a popular way to earn some bitcoin in Venezuela due to government subsidization of electricity, but some Venezuelans also try to find traditional work for bitcoin on websites such as XBTFreelancer. In terms of why Venezuelans prefer bitcoin over physical US dollars, which can be found on the black market, an anonymous source in Venezuela claimed, “At least from my perspective, bitcoin is easier to use online and it has the possibility to go up. Cash USD won’t work for both scenarios.” Russia has more trading volume than any other country on Localbitcoins, besides the United States. According to bitcoincharts.com, Localbitcoins is the most popular option for buying and selling bitcoins in Russia, but Blockchair Lead Developer Nikita Zhavoronkov says those numbers can be misleading. “Localbitcoins is not the only popular way to trade bitcoins in Russia, as there’s also off-line trading involving redeemable BTC-e codes, which anyone can redeem on the exchange,” Zhavoronkov told Bitcoin.com. “It’s hard to say which of these ways is more popular. So many people simply put bitcoins on BTC-e, create a code, and sell the code itself.” According to Zhavoronkov, the advantage of selling the BTC-e codes instead of actual bitcoins is that the codes do not require traders to wait for confirmations on the blockchain. Instead, the code can be given to the buyer to be redeemed on the site, which speeds up the trading process. In most cases, trades for BTC-e codes are made via Yandex, Qiwi, Payeer, or physical cash. According to Zhavoronkov, the local online payment systems tend to have lower identity requirements than bank transfers. Many Russians trade via the BTC/USD pair on BTC-e because that trading pair has more liquidity. BTC-e volume numbers are not entirely accurate because of the exclusion of trades involving BTC-e codes. According to Zhavoronkov, the trading of these codes is so popular in Russia that there is even a market between USD BTC-e codes and USD cash. An interesting aspect of the popularity of Localbitcoins in Russia is that it has been banned by The Federal Service for Supervision in the Sphere of Telecom, Information Technologies and Mass Communications. This means those visiting the website from Russia have to use a VPN or Tor. Even with this attempt to block access to Localbitcoins, over $20 million worth of bitcoin has been traded for rubles on the platform in the past 30 days. In addition to Localbitcoins, Zhavoronkov says much of the P2P trading activity in Russia is coordinated via Bitcointalk.org and other Russian forums. Bitcoin exchange Exmo is another means of trading the digital asset in Russia—albeit in a more centralized manner. According to Zhavoronkov, Russians use bitcoin for reasons similar to people in other countries around the world. Some simply use it as a store of value, while others use it to gain access to darknet markets and ICO (initial coin offering) schemes. In other words, it’s difficult to find a place where someone can actually spend their bitcoin in Russia. In terms of laws and regulations regarding bitcoin in Russia, it seems that area is still evolving. “It’s just like with China—our officials can’t decide what they want,” said Zhavoronkov. Do you use Localbitcoins? If so, why? Let us know in the comments below. Update: A previous version of this article claimed Surbitcoin’s volume declined in 2016.

2017-02-15T12:00:56-04:00,The Davos Plan For Your Cash and Bitcoin,Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/davos-plan-cash-bitcoin/,"“The European Commission has quietly launched the next offensive in the war on cash…The ECB…[is also] working towards a Trojan horse blockchain network that will serve only to entrap those naive enough to trust it,” states the publication Activist Post on February 9.  An acceleration in the war on cash and a shift on bitcoin occurred in the wake of the January World Economic Forum (Davos) at which the world elites planned the economic rules under which the rest of us are meant to labor. Also read: Following the PBOC Exchange Shakeup China’s Localbitcoins Volume Surges The war on cash is a war to eliminate physical money and drive all currency exchanges into the digital realm. For some bitcoin enthusiasts, this signals greater legitimacy and wider adoption. But for the war on cash to achieve the goals desired by states and central banks, the digital realm must be under state control and tightly monitored by authorities. Bitcoin, as a vehicle of personal freedom and independence, will be driven underground or gutted by regulation. To the extent it can, the EU will cripple its competitors – the free market and dissident individuals – even if it needs to co-opt internet access in the manner of an emerging nation. Fortunately, the situation is chaotic, even within the EU proper. This is fortunate because decentralization – that is, the chaos of competing and independent alternatives – results in freedom and opportunity. While France and Spain go slap happy about capping cash transactions, Germany stands in strong opposition because roughly 80% of all its transactions are conducted in cash. While the European Commission talks of reigning in bitcoin to thwart terrorism and crime, average Italians flock to it as a protection against their government’s fiscal policies. Vigorous opposition exists. Why then is there a sudden EU drive behind the cashless society and the centralization (regulation) of bitcoin? Sessions of the powerful are accompanied by public announcements which often reflect vague goals and non-binding commitments. Next to nothing is known about the private agreements that almost certainly occur between the global powerful who pitch their own interests. These specifics need to be teased out by events and policies that occur in the direct wake of Davos meetings. But two items long recognized as crucial by the Davos Men are the monetary crisis which verges on collapse, and that Fintech is the main competition to their mainstream system. Nick Giambruno, among other influential economic forecasters, believes the June meeting had “huge historical significance” which developed behind closed doors. Giambruno, the Senior Editor of Casey Research’s International Man periodical, pointed to several indications of the historical direction, including: • “Immediately after the conference, there was a big acceleration” toward a cashless society, beginning with the elimination of “high-denomination currency notes.” Publications such as Bloomberg and the Financial Times called for a cashless society. “A flood of articles from The New York Times, The Economist, Zero Hedge, and other publications picked up on this.” • Only days after Davos, “the head of the Japanese central bank implemented negative interest rates for the first time ever.” He did so despite having repeatedly denied it would happen. • Similarly, “the CEO of Deutsche Bank called for the elimination of cash. Norway’s biggest bank essentially did the same thing.” • Academia fell in line. “Harvard put out a paper talking about the need to eliminate high-value paper currencies, like the $100 bill and the €500 note.” The War on Cash, to which negative rates are integral, began to gallop. Why are negative rates integral? Banks hold very little physical cash with most currency consisting of digits flowing through official computers. If people en masse demanded cash, there would be extensive bank runs and probably a collapse. If nothing but digital transfers existed, however, the runs would not occur. Moreover, banks could charge their trapped ‘customers’ a negative interest rate. That is, people would be compelled to pay a fee for maintaining an account. This would create a vicious circle. Rather than maintain $1,000 in an account that slices off $5 a month, people would have incentive to immediately spend their digital money on real goods and services with more static value. Of course, each exchange – every penny earned, every book and head of lettuce purchased – would be seen by the state. The centralized funds could be easily taxed, frozen, confiscated, trapped within borders, and otherwise manipulated at will. The analysis of goods and services purchased could become a mainstay of social control. But the brave new monetary world only works in the absence of viable currency and trade alternatives, such as physical cash, bitcoin, and barter. Authorities know this.  Consider just two events that occurred directly after the latest Davos: • “On the 23rd January 2017, the EU Commission issued the ‘Commission Initiative Roadmap’ for 2018 regarding the step up fight against the financing of terrorism, also known as its ‘Payments Restriction Initiative’ or…the cashless society.” (EU Steps Up The Pace For Cashless Society In 2017/18). • January 28, a Bitcoin.com headline read “Bitcoin Powerhouse Bitfury Initiates Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC) in Davos.” The Davos announcement stated, “The GBBC is meant to be a truly global body for the Blockchain and business ecosystems.” If the GBBC is voluntary and does not benefit from government privileges that hobble its free market competitors, then no one can object any more than they can object to cashless systems that evolve naturally within the private sector. What are the odds? An article entitled “EU Seeks Cash Limits in Push for Orwellian ‘Cashless Society’” (Feb.7) astutely comments; “Because a ban or limits on cash transactions would, if actually enforced, lead to people using alternative means to bypass Big Brother, the EU also anticipates the need for other assaults on other means of payment that allow privacy. “ In short, an assault on bitcoin and the like. The world is a diverse maze of monetary practices, policies, and needs. The reality of cash and bitcoin use will differ dramatically from place to place depending on the specific circumstances. For individuals to prosper, rather than corporations and banks, however, the increasingly difficult trick will be to avoid regulation and the many traps that states will establish, such as Trojan horse blockchain networks. One thing that should not be tricky is the response of the bitcoin community to an expanding state presence. Regulation should not be applauded as legitimacy; it should be recognized as a death threat to the personal freedom and flexibility that bitcoin promises. And, yet, some bitcoiners will herald the state and global usurpation in the belief that it is credibility, not nationalization. Trading freedom for credibility is like trading freedom for security; it results in neither and damages both. What do you think about the Davos plan for your cash and bitcoins?

2017-02-15T06:00:42-04:00,The Many Ways You Can Book Your Travels Using Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/many-ways-book-travels-using-bitcoin/,"Many bitcoiners like to travel. In 2017 there are ways for people to use their bitcoins to book flights, car rentals, and hotels. Indeed, there are many options available to purchase any travel amenities imaginable without having to convert bitcoin to fiat. Also read: Here Are Four Bitcoin Exchanges That Require Very Little Identity Verification Did you know there are quite a few options out there to pay for flights and travel accommodations with Bitcoin? In fact, everyone’s favorite cryptocurrency can pay for plane tickets, purchase a rental car, and book lodging in cities across the globe. Over the past few years, a good handful of travel companies have embraced Bitcoin, thus enabling people to visit worldwide destinations on the decentralized currency. Cheapair.com is well-known in the cryptocurrency community for offering affordable flights for Bitcoin. The California-based company introduced Bitcoin support in 2013. Cheapair believes it was one of the first travel firms to accept the digital currency for payment processing.  “We will do whatever it takes to make travel buying easier and give Cheapair customers more options,” said Jeff Klee, CEO of Cheapair at the time. “We’re intrigued by the growing Bitcoin phenomenon, and we are happy to provide Bitcoin users an easy, secure way to book flights.” The platform’s interface is pretty straightforward and operates like any other online travel service. Users can book flights to anywhere in the world from most airports and major airline services. Cheapair can also provide hotel accommodations and car rentals for trips as well. All of these services can be purchased with bitcoin immediately by using the company’s shopping cart portal. BTCTrip believes it is “the travel agency for the cryptocurrency community.” The New York-based company, founded in 2013 by Yamil Alis and Martin Fernandez, enables users to pay with bitcoin for travel needs. Currently, the service offers flight and hotel accommodations, covering many destinations worldwide. The user interface is fairly simple, allowing users to fill out where they would like to travel, followed by departure and return dates. The travel company also accepts Dogecoin and Litecoin payments.  Expedia is probably one of the most popular online travel agencies and has been around since 1996. The full-service travel giant announced it would accept bitcoin back in June 2014. The announcement pleased the cryptocurrency community, as it meant a degree of mainstream acceptance. The company partnered with Coinbase to facilitate bitcoin purchases for flight and travel accommodations. Fred Ehrsam, co-founder of Coinbase, explained that “By accepting bitcoin as a form of payment, Expedia is giving a wider community of users the opportunity to book hotels from their site’s inventory of properties all around the world quickly and easily.” Expedia users simply choose a flight, hotel or car rental using the company’s online platform, and proceed to pay with bitcoin at checkout. Expedia does have a separate terms and conditions page specifically for bitcoin purchases. The site explains how Coinbase facilitates the payment, tells its customers about miner fees, and how bitcoin transactions are irreversible. There are other companies that offer airline tickets for bitcoin payments. If you are planning to travel around the European mainland a company called Abitsky offers discounted flights and travel accommodations for travelers paying with bitcoin. Destinia is another company that offers trip amenities for destinations all around the world using cryptocurrency payments. Destinia recently said it would rather “build bridges than walls”, speaking out in opposition to Donald Trump’s immigration statements. The travel agency is offering a 5 percent discount for those traveling from Mexico to the U.S. Another full-service travel agency that accepts bitcoin payments is Fluege.com, which offers flights, hotels, and car rentals worldwide. Furthermore, the well-known airline service Airbaltic has offered alternative payment choices, such as bitcoin for flights, since 2014. The well-known airline takes passengers to many Baltic state destinations, and the company can be found at many local airports worldwide. While planning a trip can be frustrating, finding a travel agency that accepts Bitcoin is pretty easy. Have you ever used any of these companies to purchase travel arrangements with bitcoin?

2017-02-15T01:00:28-04:00,"Hivemind, Bloq Developer Paul Sztorc Discusses Bitcoin & Sidechains",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/software-developer-paul-sztorc-discusses-bitcoin-sidechains/,"Bitcoin.com chatted with the Chief Scientist of prediction market protocol Hivemind. Paul Sztorc, who also works with the blockchain firm Bloq, gives our readers an update on Hivemind, his work on peer-to-peer sidechains, Blockstream’s Liquid, Segregated Witness and more. Also read: Hedge Funds Are Buying Mt Gox Bitcoin Claims Bitcoin.com (BC): What’s new with Hivemind? Paul Sztorc (PS): Hivemind has gone so well that work on it has outstripped the work on its prerequisites. In other words, Hivemind is a sidechain of Bitcoin, but in 2015 my work on Hivemind ended up being more complete than anyone’s work on sidechains. So I have moved ‘down the stack.’ I paused my work on an individual sidechain to work on “sidechains” in general. BC: Can you tell our readers how you are working with sidechains? PS: It became clear in 2015 that no one was actually working on making P2P sidechains. So I gave the problem a few weeks of thought, and published “Drivechain” on my blog in November 2015. Since then, most of my full-time efforts have been on drivechain itself. BC: You recently retweeted something in regards to “concerns” with Blockstream’s Liquid sidechain. Can you tell us about this?  PS: Firstly, Liquid is not peer-to-peer, it uses a federated model. The federated model is very old – it is effectively a single multisignature wallet – and, in my humble opinion, it is boring. The security model is unlikely to scale, because if ‘X=7’ keys are compromised, then the wallet can be emptied, and divided among the seven conspirators. So it is unlikely to work for more than, say, $70 million.  However, my main problem with Liquid is that I don’t understand how it is useful. Supposedly, it allows exchanges to send BTC payments to each other, quickly. However, this is exactly what payment channels do. My understanding is that Blockstream charges money for Liquid, but payment channels will do the same job for free. In some sense, Liquid is a bet that the engineers who work at Bitcoin exchanges will be too stupid to figure out how to use payment channels. And, once lightning is operational, the exchanges can just open lightning channels with each other. BC: What are the benefits of using sidechains over altcoins? PS: There are many. The big one is that anyone can code up a blockchain project and deploy it, without also facing the near-impossible task of bootstrapping a new unit of money.   BC: What is your opinion of Segregated Witness consensus? PS: If memory serves, Segwit was, in fact, the compromise that everyone had consensus about. Segwit was itself the terminus of the first two Scaling Conferences. Given that Segwit gives (almost) everyone what they want, ‘Why is it not activating?’ BC: How do you feel about the current state of Bitcoin development? PS: In one sense, development is fantastic. Many smart people, all working hard, on fantastic stuff. We see tremendous specialization of labor and wonderful inventions. In another sense, it is a disaster. This is a difficult place to work for many people. There is a constant developer shortage. Developers often work 24/7 and don’t have time for peer review or public education. At the same time, poor work can potentially destroy Bitcoin for everyone. The result is a dev culture that is very paranoid, irritable, and hostile. And with some justification – much of the work is useless or an outright scam, and most of the good ideas are unintentional duplicates. We could also improve things if there was some kind of reputable repository of knowledge – like a textbook, an academic journal or an up-to-date wiki. Due to the polarized climate, such a resource would likely be captured by one side, and de-legitimized by the other. BC: How is your work with Bloq going?  PS: I enjoy it here because I have the freedom to direct my own work. Bloq is not very large, only 15 or so people. But I like being a big fish in a small pond, so the saying goes. I also feel that we have a rare mix of innovativeness and practicality. What do you think? Let us know in the comments below?

2017-02-14T18:30:07-04:00,"Former Governor of Bank of China: `If you want to kill Bitcoin, it will be an impossible taskÂ´",Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/governor-bank-china-kill-bitcoin-impossible/,"“Bitcoin was built on a platform without national boundaries,” the Former Governor of the Bank of China, L H Li, said on CCTV Tuesday in China. “If you want to kill Bitcoin, it will be an impossible task. So it will continue to exist. What is important now is that we should properly regulate it.”Â  Rumors in China have led bitcoin exchange executives to expect âforthcoming official guidelines in the coming weeksâ by PBoC (People’s Bank of China). âSuch regulations could set a global precedentâ, says AurÃ©lien Menant, Founder, and CEO of Gatecoin, a regulated blockchain asset exchange based in Hong Kong. âChina will probably beat Japan as the first nation to officially regulate cryptocurrency trading and exchange activities.â Related: Localbitcoin’s Volume Surges in China âFollowing the growth of QQcoin in the late 2000s, virtual currencies were banned in China,â says Mr. Menant, referring to a previous digital currency experiment. But this did not stop China from becoming a Bitcoin powerhouse. The Bitcoin industry started to emerge in 2011, as did interest from several large regional venture capital firms, like Zhenfund, IDG and Sequoia Capital. Since late 2013, according to Mr. Menant, Chinese bitcoin exchanges came to dominate global trading volumes. This was largely thanks to large bitcoin mining operations in Mainland China, which created a high amount of liquidity in the market. âA lack of lucrative domestic investment opportunities also stoked demand for alternative assets, such as bitcoin, and until recently the government had taken a relatively laissez-faire approach to bitcoin exchange activities which provided opportunities for leveraged tradingâ, Mr. Menant says. The situation has changed swiftly early 2017. âThe PBoCâs investigations into Bitcoin service providers prove that the Chinese Government recognizes the potential of Bitcoin to enable secure value transfers,â according to Mr. Menant. Chinese authorities are seeking to ensure that Bitcoin investors receive the same protections and are subject to the same levels of scrutiny as investors of conventional asset classes, according to state releases. âThis change in perspective demonstrates the growing adoption of bitcoin as an asset class, and is a sign of the development of regulated bitcoin trading markets in Mainland China. This is significant given that China is still home to the largest bitcoin trading volumes,â says Mr. Menant. âThere are persistent and increasing rumors of capital controls being applied to local bitcoin exchanges, which, if true, are likely to have a strong impact on volumes and price.â There are no official statements confirming such capital controls. Mainstream media both in the east and the west has fostered an environment of hysteria around PBoC actions, claiming there will be a âcrackdownâ or âbanâ on Bitcoin. Gatecoin believes actions by Chinese authorities will instead harbor a âclearer understandingâ about Bitcoin in the country, and weed out bad actors. âPlayers will be forced to comply with regulations designed to protect retail investors and legitimize bitcoin as an asset class,â according to Mr. Menant. âWith the absence of so many exchanges offering leveraged trading, we are seeing more normal volumes and price movements, and as the global share of Chinese exchanges declines, events in China are going to have far less influence on the average price.â Chinese volumes did demonstrate a steep drop after PBoC announcements, and the subsequent fees on Bitcoin margin trading instituted by main Chinese bitcoin exchanges. The volumes have since partially rebounded. Although Gatecoin is based in Hong Kong, forty percent of the firmâs clients are based in Europe, with thirty percent from Greater China and the rest of the world. The firm, which lists ethereum tokens, is still working to reimburse the clients affected by a May 2016 hack, in which $2 million in funds were stolen, but has yet to announce a timeline for the completion of the repayment. Gatecoin participated in a blockchain conference in 2016 organized by Chinese officials in Changsha. Ji Xiaonan, President of the Board of Supervisors for Chinaâs State-Owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission,â referred to Bitcoin as âthe only mature blockchain technologyâ in use. âThe biggest blockchain market is China,â he added, while commending the digital currency for its decentralizing aspects and peer-to-peer nature. Mr. Menant adds: âWe are eager to meet with the Chinese authorities on a regular basis to help them setting up a balanced regulatory frameworkÂ like we do in Hong Kong and Europe.â What do you think about the new changes to Chinese bitcoin exchanges?

2017-02-14T12:00:55-04:00,How Japan’s New Regulations Affect Bitcoin Exchanges,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-regulations-bitcoin-exchanges/,"Japan has recently overtaken the US and China as the highest-volume country for bitcoin trading in the world. In April, the first Japanese bill with provisions for digital currencies including bitcoin will enter into force. It will recognize bitcoin as a method of payment, but at the same time, it will impose regulations on bitcoin exchange service providers. Also read: Countdown: Bitcoin Will Be a Legal Method of Payment in Japan in Two Months  Japan’s Payment Services Act and the Act on Prevention of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds were amended on May 25, 2016, to impose certain regulations on digital currency exchange service providers, including bitcoin exchanges. The drafts of proposed amendments were announced by the Financial Services Agency of Japan (FSA) last December and are expected to take effect in April. Any entity wanting to provide a digital currency exchange service must be registered with the Prime Minister. The amendments lay out numerous other requirements such as having a minimum capital of 10 million yen, deploying sufficient IT system defenses against theft and loss, and providing certain information to users such as their trading address, registration number and fee schedule. Another part of the new regulations requires exchanges to establish several systems and processes, including employee training, internal rules, governance, and guidance for outsourcing. In addition, they must also regularly undergo an audit by a public certified accountant or audit firm at least once a year and submit periodic activity and annual reports. The bill aims to protect consumers with “reasonable restrictions,” Yuzo Kano, CEO of Bitflyer, told Bitcoin.com. “Even foreign entities who provide services to Japanese residents will be regulated under the law”, he said. Bitflyer is the largest exchange by volume today, according to Coinhills. The exchange has raised a total of $35.6 million in funding up to date, including the recent investment of 200 million yen from investors such as Mizuho Capital. Other shareholders include large Japanese corporations such as SBI Investment, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Mitsui Financial Group, Densu Digital Holdings, and GMO. Kano noted that: Kagayaki Kawabata, Business Development Lead at Coincheck, another major Japanese exchange, told Bitcoin.com that “overall the new bill itself is a progressive bill that will position Japan as the leading Bitcoin country.” However, given that there are so many requirements, he feels that “the law will be a huge barrier to entry for underfunded early stage cryptocurrency startups”, adding that “from our standpoint, as a cryptocurrency startup started by a single programmer, it’s pretty sad that the new regulation may wipe the potential of startups like us”. Coincheck has been experiencing substantial growth recently, with US$130 million in monthly transactions, and new signups at a rate of 1,000 every day. Its merchant processor service is also growing quickly, swelling from 1,000 to 5,000 merchants over the last year. Overall Kawabata believes that: Kawabata explained that “there are various requirements we need to comply with to continue our exchange business,” he said. “As an operating exchange, KYC/AML and paperwork are probably the heaviest part. We need to comply with strict KYC requirements similar to banks which cause new users’ KYC process to be somewhat complex”. For Bitflyer, Kano also admitted that “we will need to change the KYC process to fit the new rule.” In anticipation of this bill, he noted that “we have already been audited and have prepared necessary internal organization changes.” Do you agree with the two exchanges that this bill will help take bitcoin adoption in Japan to the next level?

2017-02-14T01:00:43-04:00,Bitcoin and the Solar Energy Industry Are Booming in Sync,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-solar-energy-industry-booming/,"Due to its unprecedented growth, the economic importance of the solar energy industry is surpassing that of the fuel energy industry. The solar industry’s exponential growth has boosted solar jobs by 25 percent since 2015, the Solar Foundation reported. Concurrently, Bitcoin and the Internet of Things are becoming an even more integral element of the solar energy industry. Also read: Dutch Hackathon Looks at Blockchain Energy Solutions The fall of installation costs is one of the main factors driving the solar energy boom. One key indicator of this extraordinary growth is the number of jobs the solar industry is creating. According to the Solar Foundation, “The Solar Jobs Census 2016 found that solar employment increased by over 51,000 workers, a 25 percent increase over 2015. Overall, the Solar Jobs Census found there were 260,077 solar workers in 2016.” The report estimates that the industry will continue to sustain its growth, predicting that total solar employment will increase by 10 percent to 286,335 solar workers, in the next 12 months. Now, in the US, the solar energy industry has created one of every fifty new jobs. As a result, the number of solar energy industry jobs is twice as great as the number of coal jobs. Another key indicator is the number of photovoltaic installations, which are breaking historic records in the US, particularly during Q3 2016, as shown in the chart below.  The solar energy industry growth is indeed dramatic. The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that “4,143 megawatts (MW) of solar PV were installed in the U.S. in the third quarter of the year, a rate of one MW every 32 minutes. That pace is even faster today, as the fourth quarter will surpass this past quarter’s historic total.” Bitcoin and the solar energy industry are increasingly intertwined. For instance, buying solar panels with bitcoins is becoming easier. Several businesses, such as gogreensolar.com, AM Solar, and Spendabit, offer complete solar panel kits and accept bitcoin as payment. Additionally, many experts believe Bitcoin technology can help solve fundamental problems related to the energy industry, in particular distribution and trading. Laurent Schmitt, Smart Grid Strategy Leader for GE’s Grid Solutions, says, “The problem of ‘too much’ renewable energy on a grid can be solved with blockchain, a technology most often associated with Bitcoin. Blockchain will provide a transparent way for households and businesses to trade renewables with each other.” In this regard, an Australian startup, Power Ledger, announced on December 1, 2016, the launching of Australia’s first “blockchain-powered” residential electricity trading market. This market facilitates the sale of surplus renewable energy produced at residential and commercial developments connected to existing electricity distribution networks, or within microgrids. “Power Ledger puts the power to manage the energy economy into the hands of consumers while maintaining the value of existing distribution networks,” claims the Power Ledger’s website. Thanks to the combined power of the Internet of Things, Bitcoin technology, and community power storage, innovative microgrid concepts are becoming a reality. “Community storage, distributed generation, electric vehicle fleets, and coordinated load management can all be enabled by IoT, machine learning, and blockchains. We are exploring how this will make for a more efficient and clean energy system,” affirms IDEO Colab’s website. Specifically, the blockchain-based Transactive Grid provides real-time metering of local energy production and usage and other relevant data, allowing users to trade energy on this platform openly. This project, which started in a Brooklyn neighborhood, in New York, has now attracted the interest of tech giant Siemens. According to an LO3 Energy and Siemens joint press release: “The microgrid planned for Brooklyn, which started as a pilot project of LO3 Energy, is now being further developed with the aid of Siemens Digital Grid in the US. For the first time, a microgrid control solution from Siemens is being combined with the peer-to-peer trading platform from LO3 Energy known as Transactive Grid.” Bitcoin technology, the IoT, and other Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies will continue fueling the growth of the solar power industry with increasing momentum, facilitating the creation of amazing solutions to generate, distribute, and trade solar and other renewable energy sources.

2017-02-13T17:00:37-04:00,Following the PBOC Exchange Shakeup China’s Localbitcoins Volume Surges,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/pboc-exchange-shakeup-china-localbitcoins-volume-surges/,"Things are changing in China as far as Bitcoin exchanges are concerned. Over the course of the past few weeks, China’s central bank has been inspecting and regulating the country’s top cryptocurrency exchanges. The event has caused a significant shift in Chinese Bitcoin trading causing Localbitcoins volumes to grow exponentially while exchanges in China make changes to their business model. Also read: Hedge Funds Are Buying Mt Gox Bitcoin Claims It all started in the first week of 2017 when Chinese officials from the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) began inspecting the country’s local Bitcoin exchanges. At the time it was shrugged off by the Bitcoin community as the Chinese exchange BTCC’s founder Bobby Lee detailed it was business as usual. However, the top three leading exchanges began publicly stating new exchange policies which included ending margin lending and adding fees to every trade facilitated. “Market makers and takers will both be charged a flat fee of 0.2 percent per transaction,” explained BTCC at the time. “We are implementing fee-based trading to curb market manipulation and extreme volatility.” Following these initial inspections by the PBOC and the top three Bitcoin exchanges, word broke out the bank was also visiting with nine other exchanges. The PBOC’s recent statement revealed the bank was looking for illegal activities and technical risks. The central bank warned exchanges were not to allow margin lending practices and money laundering. The news didn’t seem to stir the Bitcoin community or price at the time. But the following day was a different story.  On February 9 the exchanges Huobi and Okcoin announced they were suspending BTC and LTC withdrawals for one month. The news seemed to resonate with Bitcoin trading markets as the price slid 10 percent that morning. Bitcoin’s fiat value has rebounded since that time, and many believe China’s grasp on the market is grower weaker. Meanwhile, smaller exchanges in China such as Btctrade, Yunbi and others have started to strengthen withdrawal reviews. Other Bitcoin trading platforms like Bitbay, Chbtc, and Yuanbao have temporarily suspended withdrawals. Chinese Bitcoin trading volumes have dropped significantly since these new policies took effect while the price continues to remain high. Now, this week the Chinese Bitcoin exchange and mining company HaoBTC has revealed it will be ending its exchange services. The company will be focusing solely on its mining efforts, online wallets and leaving the bitcoin trading business entirely. Moreover, after all these Chinese exchange revelations, Localbitcoins volumes have exploded.  All eyes will continue to remain focused on further changes within China’s bitcoin exchange industry.

2017-02-13T11:00:01-04:00,Hedge Funds Are Buying Mt Gox Bitcoin Claims,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/hedge-funds-buying-mt-gox-bitcoin-claims/,"Mt Gox creditors have waited for over three years to see some of their lost bitcoins returned, but the end is still not in sight. However, a number of them may be able to cash out soon since some hedge funds are now buying Mt Gox claims, offering 15 percent of the claims’ value in cash. Also read: CoinLab Lawsuit Delaying Mt Gox Payouts: Trustee  A website called Mygoxclaim, has been created by some Mt Gox creditors to connect claimants with interested buyers. According to the Financial Times, Daniel Kelman, an attorney representing creditor interest in the case and a Mt Gox creditor himself, is one of the people responsible for setting up the site. Created last week, this website serves “as an information portal and liaison to help you sell your claim in the MtGox bankruptcy”. The owners claim to have friends in finance and found some people interested in purchasing claims. “There are indeed parties interested in purchasing claims on a claim by claim basis”, they wrote, adding that: “The process is simple”, the site noted, adding that interested sellers need to send an email with their claim information including name, claimed amount, and whether the claim is in bitcoin or fiat. “We need sufficient information to identify you and your claim so we can get you an offer”, the website says. In addition, “serious inquiries only”, it further informs citing that “there will be due diligence to make sure your claim is real before any transaction takes place”. When Mt Gox closed its doors for the last time in late February 2014, it had already been denying all withdrawals from the exchange for several weeks as the price fell sharply. In April 2014, the exchange announced that around 850,000 of their customers’ bitcoins were missing. Local Japanese investigators were quickly brought in but investigations have been slow. In November 2014, bitcoin exchange Kraken was appointed by the Japanese court to help with the investigation of missing bitcoins and the distribution of assets to Mt Gox creditors. Last May, Kraken confirmed that the amount of bitcoin held by the Mt Gox estate is approximately 202,185 bitcoins, which represents less than a quarter of the amount lost. According to Kraken, 24,750 creditors have filed claims as of last May. The list of all eligible claimants can be found on the Mygoxclaim website. At least four hedge funds in the United States and Japan have begun buying or offering to buy claims from many thousands of Mt Gox claimants, the Financial Times reported. Claimholders can sell their claims now and “receive 15 per cent of the yen value of each claim in cash” the publication was told. “For three years we have followed the proceedings and grown increasingly frustrated at the slow pace of events”, Mygoxclaim website owners wrote. The claim is now going on its fourth year and could take significantly longer to settle since there are also five other Mt Gox-related legal disputes going on. For example, the $75 million lawsuit filed against Mt Gox by its former business partner Coinlab has to be resolved before claims can be settled.

2017-02-13T05:00:06-04:00,Erik Voorhees On “The True Cost of Bitcoin Transactions”,Erik Voorhees,https://news.bitcoin.com/true-cost-bitcoin-transactions/,"This op-ed article is written by Erik Voorhees and was originally published here. It seems the Bitcoin community is not correctly tallying the true cost of Bitcoin transactions. The belief is that Cost = Miner Fee. We’ll show why this is wrong, but the fee is of course part of the cost, so let’s examine it first… Fees are currently averaging in the range of $0.30 to $1.00 per transaction. Here’s an anecdotal sample as I’m writing this: 83 cents per transaction on average… Is that “too expensive?” That’s a judgement call, and sincere people can disagree about what is “too expensive.” It depends what one uses Bitcoin for. Some people, indeed, are using Bitcoin to move “normal” amounts of money around (ie – like a “peer-to-peer cash system”). This doesn’t refer to “micro transactions,” which are fractions of a dollar and have been impractical in Bitcoin for years, rather it refers to casual payments of $1-$50 in value, which make up the vast majority of human economic activity broadly, and a great deal of Bitcoin activity, specifically. An $0.83 fee doesn’t matter for a $2,500 payment, but it matters if you’re sending $7 to a friend. Indeed, it will actually preclude a $3 daily wage payment. Consider that a great way to make Bitcoin centralized is to reduce its utility to only the world’s richest. And those who imagine such users to be using Bitcoin “wrong” are perhaps not understanding what consequences that sentiment invites: such users, finding less utility in Bitcoin, will be incentivized to go to other platforms or just stick with the status quo: fiat. How tragic that someone would actually prefer fiat, but many will if Bitcoin is too expensive to use as a peer-to-peer cash system. So on the topic of the explicit miner fee, maybe $0.83 is too high, and maybe not. It depends what a user is trying to accomplish. But $0.83 isn’t the true cost… and this is a point most observers are missing. The true cost of a Bitcoin transaction can be better considered as: Cost = Fee + Time taken to determine fee + Risk of uncertainty. What do I mean by this? Those people who are using Bitcoin today pay more than a miner fee, they pay in time and uncertainty (risk). As blocks are full, users often need to change the fee they add to their transaction (before or after they send it). Some wallets do an okay job of this, but most don’t (and before you vilify wallet creators, realize that “smart fee policy” is nowhere near a science yet, and changes all the time). So, in addition to the $0.83 miner fee, the user currently has to also spend Time to determine that it ought to be $0.83 in the first place. A highly-skilled Bitcoiner can figure out an appropriate fee in a minute, but Bitcoin cannot be imagined as a platform only for highly-skilled Bitcoiners. If that is the target market, then the project is doomed. A normal user (meaning most users) struggle with the fee estimation (hell, I’ve been doing Bitcoin for six years and I’m not the most graceful at fee calculation myself). Many casual (read: normal) users of Bitcoin get horribly confused, and if they even bother trying to figure it out, they may wander over to /r/bitcoin to ask advice. Look at this comment on Reddit to a user who was confused about transaction delays and fees:  We should realize how awkward and confusing that is for a normal Bitcoin user (ie – a non-technical person who wants a system that is easy and convenient). And at least that comment was trying to be helpful. Many users get responses more like this:    Jesus. Add in the misery of dealing with people like /u/MinersFolly and it’s amazing Bitcoin is gaining users at all. So back to our equation, the true cost of a transaction is: $0.83 (maybe?) + time to determine $0.83 + Risk of uncertainty. What do I mean by uncertainty? Well, even if a user figures out a recommended fee, there is no guarantee it will be confirmed in the next block. Using a recommended fee gives zero guarantee of delivery time. Here’s a depressing real world anecdote: A couple months ago I had some friends over for a Civ 6 LAN party. One guy didn’t have the game, so I offered to buy it on Steam for him (they accept Bitcoin!). I paid the BitPay invoice for the Steam game, and waited. And waited. And waited. 25 minutes later it still hadn’t showed up. Three blocks had already happened. Everyone is sitting around waiting. Ultimately, I just pulled out a credit card and bought the game (paying again) so that we could all play. A year ago, this would not have happened. What went wrong? Was my fee incorrect? (I paid the high fee option in Jaxx wallet). Was the mempool too full? We just wanted to play, so back to the 50 year old credit card technology I went. There are some in the community who read the above and actually think, “meh, what’s the big deal?”  Or perhaps respond, “just wait two years for Lightning!”  Cool, tell me that when I’m trying to buy Civ 7. Back to the present… because of this uncertainty users are facing, one of two consequences happen: 1) the user gets annoyed at the delay, or actually suffers some kind of economic loss, or 2) the user can’t use Bitcoin for this tx at all because it is time sensitive and user can’t risk the uncertainty. And be careful not to discount the utility loss to a Bitcoin user, who was getting excited about making a Bitcoin transaction (the future of money!), only to discover his tx is stuck in the mempool for 33 hours. We’re lucky if that user ever gives Bitcoin another chance. Fee + Time + Risk of uncertainty (F+T+Ru). Since T and Ru are not measureable, it seems most engineers in the industry have been completely oblivious to them. The costs are more apparent to an economist, and are very apparent to anyone in business with actual users (there’s a reason why nearly every Bitcoin business with more than ten thousand users is very eager to see both SegWit and a hardfork blocksize increase… but that’s another topic). As blocks approach capacity: 1)     Miner fees get more expensive 2)     Time/effort to determine fees rises 3)     The reliability of transactions falls toward zero (risk of hours-long delay for first confirmation, even with “good fees”) Many people have only been considering #1, above. Those who look at a recent tx fee of $0.30 and obnoxiously proclaim, “transactions are cheap, you can’t expect the system to be free!” are really missing the point and are harming the prospects of this project. The miner fee is only part of the cost that users are dealing with, and if peoples’ time and sanity are worth anything, it is the lesser part. And let’s end this silly false dichotomy of Bitcoin as a “payment system” vs a “settlement system.” Such distinction is a relic of fiat banking networks and has no place with blockchain-based assets. The reality is this: every payment on a blockchain network is a settlement, and the cheaper these transactions, the more widespread uses the platform will find, meaning greater utility, a broader and more decentralized user-base, higher market capitalization, more liquidity, and therefore more hashpower dedicated to it, and more security derived therefrom. If Bitcoin transactions are too expensive (considering F+T+Ru), people will use other platforms instead for some or all of their economic activity, period. As I tweeted yesterday, I’ve found myself now holding a modest balance of Ethereum merely for the purpose of small (not micro) payments to friends. It’s just cheaper and more reliable. And I’m doing that with more allegiance to Bitcoin than almost anyone on Earth, how dedicated will a normal person be to a platform that isn’t helpful to them? The response of some has been, “so what, good riddance.” Such people are being arrogant, naïve, and suffering from a disease common in the business world: not listening to or respecting customers. Such people are free to have that sentiment, of course, just as they are free to end up on a lonely platform. Now, obviously a blockchain cannot (and should not) handle all the world’s transactions on-chain, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t do all we can to acquire as much transaction marketshare as safely possible. This is a platform about network effects, after all. Just because it’s true that Bitcoin’s blockchain can’t handle Visa-level scale on-chain, doesn’t mean we should be comfortable and complacent about a 5 tx/sec threshold today, especially during Bitcoin’s formative years, while the world is still watching and waiting to see if it catches on as the money protocol of the future (those who think Bitcoin’s dominance is “inevitable” are, again, suffering arrogance). The community needs to take at- or near-capacity blocks seriously, and yet many have dismissed the issue, saying silly things like “well when fees rise it’s just the free market at work.”  Sure it is, and when users leave Bitcoin, or never bother a second transaction because their first was obnoxious and unreliable, their preference of alternatives will also “just be the free market at work.”  The goal should be to do everything practical to make Bitcoin cheaper and more efficient, because if we don’t, it leaves a huge opportunity for Bitcoin’s successor. Bitcoin is free-market money. It competes, and it must be competitive. As the true cost of Bitcoin transactions rises, utility at the margin falls, and the platform’s fundamental value as a tool for human economic interaction declines alongside. Reduce the number of use-cases for which Bitcoin makes sense, and the quantity and quality of people willing to hold a portion of Bitcoin declines.

2017-02-13T00:00:29-04:00,Could Bitcoin Affect Emerging Market Monetary Policy?,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/could-bitcoin-affect-emerging-market-monetary-policy/,"Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis Vice President, Dr. David Andolfatto, is optimistic about Bitcoin, as an alternative currency could impose limitations on the ability of governments to raise revenue through money creation. “In some countries”, the former professor says, “the ability for a central bank to print money is a significant source of revenue for the government. It’s not the case in the U.S. or developed countries. But in underdeveloped countries, where you don’t have a well-developed tax system, and still a relatively large fraction of the population living in the countryside, an alternative to collecting taxes is through the inflation tax. That is, to print money”. Also Read: How Bitcoin Apps Help People Survive Emerging Market Volatility Dr. Andolfatto, who posts his thoughts on the Macromania blog, doesn’t take a qualitative position on the inflation tax. “If a government does it to build a hospital for sick children, it’s arguably a good thing,” he points out. “If it does it for military hardware for evil friends, it’s probably bad. Either way, if a government finds itself fiscally constrained, it’s going to want to start printing money at a faster and faster rate. 10 percent in the first year, then 20 percent a year, 30 percent, and so on. At those rates, it becomes costly to hold cash because it’s losing its purchasing power very rapidly”. In such circumstances, people tend to seek out money substitutes or alternative currencies like gold, the US dollar or bitcoin. Recent examples include places like Zimbabwe and Venezuela. “What people do in high inflationary and hyperinflationary circumstances is seek alternative or competing currencies,” Dr. Andolfatto tells Bitcoin.com. “This could be the U.S. dollar, gold and things like that. Governments and central banks often then impose currency restrictions, maybe by implementing laws keeping people from opening USD denominated bank accounts.” It’s not so easy, however, for a money printing central bank to stymie capital inflows into digital currency. “Enter Bitcoin, where any kid with a phone and access to the internet can now access this alternative cryptocurrency not under jurisdiction of any government, because it’s accessible through the internet,” the Vice President explains. “The only way a government could really crack down on it is through draconian measures, essentially shutting down the internet in the country or confiscating everyone’s personal devices.” Also Read: Federal Reserve Report Favors Private Ledgers to Open Blockchains Provided a government doesn’t go so far, Dr. Andolfatto believes Bitcoin could promote central bank moderation in fiscally strained countries. “You can see how this competing currency might impose some sort of discipline on a central bank in the future if Bitcoin becomes more popular, and is more widely used in, say, a country like Venezuela,” he says. “This potentially precludes the ability of a central bank and government to over-inflate the currency.” This alternative currency could have implications for central bank policies in other jurisdictions in the developing world, according to Dr. Andolfatto, whose interests are in banking, money and payment systems. “You’ve always seen competing currencies emerge, the only difference is this one is digital and through the internet,” he notes. “To the extent that Bitcoin is available, to the extent bitcoin has zero inflation, people are going to be asking themselves, ‘Why should I accept this bolivar for my labor and goods when the bolivar is depreciating at a quick rate? Why don’t I just accept bitcoin with my phone and payment address?’ In that matter, the population substitutes out the domestic currency, the bolivar in this case, and starts to ignore it. It becomes valueless or is driven out of circulation and the economy switches to bitcoin or some other substitute.”  So, if no one wants the bolivar, Venezuela’s ability to extract an inflation tax then goes to zero. “[A government’s] ability to acquire goods and services by printing money depends on people accepting money,” Dr. Andolfatto elucidates. “If no one accepts bolivars, only bitcoins, then the central bank and government are going to be out of luck”. He adds: “If central bank and government understand the threat of this currency substitution, they are not likely to increase inflation rate. They will keep the inflation rate lower than it otherwise would have been, and will be able to extract less inflation tax revenue because people could dump the bolivar and substitute with bitcoin”. Dr. Andolfatto, notably, doesn’t believe Bitcoin represents an entirely new phenomenon altogether. “Central banks have been under threat of currency competition since the beginning of [central banking history],” he tells Bitcoin.com. “Currency competition is arguably a good thing. It’s been a good thing. There is nothing to prevent anyone from paying someone in pesos here in the U.S. The same is true for bitcoin. And bitcoin is a de facto foreign currency as far as central banks are concerned.” Why do you use bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-02-12T15:00:49-04:00,Bitcoin Privacy Enhanced: Reusable Payment Codes Just Got More Useful,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/reusable-payment-codes-useful/,"Reusable payment codes, which can be used in place of bitcoin addresses to give transactions more privacy, just got more useful. Now there is a directory for payment codes, beta-launched last week by the Samourai Wallet developers. Also read: Reusable ‘Payment Codes’ for Privacy: Coming to a Wallet Near You?  The invention of the highly private bitcoin payment codes for Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) wallets dates back to 2015, when Bitcoin developer and engineer Justus Ranvier wrote Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 47 (BIP47) to define the technique for creating payment codes. According to his definition: Last year, Samourai Wallet became the first to create a full BIP47 implementation of payment codes, designed to bring privacy to public bitcoin payments. Payment codes are longer than Bitcoin addresses and can only be generated in wallets that are BIP47-ready, and so far that only includes the Samourai Wallet. Both sending and receiving parties need the Android-only Samourai wallet to use the feature. When sending bitcoins using a payment code, a payment channel will be created between both wallets by sending a special transaction on the blockchain called a ‘broadcast transaction,’ which requires one network confirmation to confirm, Samourai’s website explains. Here are the instructions on how to set up a payment code. Last week, the startup announced a beta launch of Paymentcode.io, a searchable, public directory of reusable payment codes. The directory allows anyone to sign up with just an email address, and all Bitcoin users in the future can add their payment codes to the directory, associated with their chosen information such as their name, social media accounts, and a picture. Using the directory, anyone’s payment code can be looked up by name, social username, or email address. From there, bitcoin can be sent directly to anyone by scanning the QR code on the page. No addresses will be shared or reused, and there’s no way to track the transaction. Once other wallets have included BIP47 payment codes, their users can also add their codes to the directory, making it a central directory for everyone’s payment codes. Posting a bitcoin public address online such as on forums or social media pages is far from private, since the world can track payment history associated with that address on the blockchain. A payment code can be publicly associated with an identity without giving anyone the ability to track its transactions on the blockchain. They’re created to be bitcoin address alternatives that can be posted publicly en masse with none of the privacy concerns that bitcoin users now face. Bitcoins sent to a payment code get directed to a unique bitcoin address every time. The recipient will be able to “see the payment code of the sender and can send bitcoins back to them as easily as replying to an email,” Ranvier explained to Bitcoin.com. Payment codes are therefore great for mass advertising and accepting payments privately. He also noted that: Are you using payment codes yet? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-02-12T09:00:07-04:00,Here Are Four Bitcoin Exchanges That Require Very Little Identity Verification,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/four-bitcoin-exchanges-little-identity-verification/,"Governments have been increasing their efforts to regulate and monitor digital currency operations. Many global exchanges now require identification to register on their sites. With politicians currently forming blockchain research groups and crafting Bitcoin legislation, it’s safe to say regulatory actions will continue. Also read: 21 Inc’s New Venture: Email That Pays Recipients in Bitcoin Even though a vast majority of popular Bitcoin exchanges require identification, there are still a few that enable buying and selling without identity verification.  Localbitcoins is a peer-to-peer exchange that facilitates bitcoin trading for local currencies. The Finland-based company was founded in 2012 by Jeremias Kangas who designed a reputation system, escrow, and dispute resolution service into the platform. The exchange offers a wide array of payment choices to purchase and sell bitcoin such as cash, Paypal, gift cards, Western Union, bank wires, and more. Similar to Craigslist, users advertise whether they are looking to purchase or sell bitcoin. Localbitcoins has become popular worldwide and can be typically accessed from most local regions. Users are not required to verify their identity to use the Localbitcoins platform, but can choose to do so if they so desire. There is an option to upload a state-issued identification card, license, and a phone number. Verifying these IDs does add more trust to the buying and selling process as far as reputation is concerned. However, users can opt out of these verification processes and still conduct trades on the platform. The Sarasota-based Bitcoin marketplace, Wall of Coins, is also a peer-to-peer exchange that enables no verification crypto-trading. The cash-to-bitcoin exchange platform is available in multiple countries around the world, including Canada, Brazil, Germany, Latvia, Poland, and the Philippines. The company boasts that it has top notch security with all Bitcoin reserves held in cold storage and an infrastructure dedicated to privacy. To prove the cold storage claim, Wall of Coin’s founder, Robert Genito, has made all of the company’s deposit addresses available to the public. Addresses are posted on their website signed with GPG keys so that deposits can be verified. There is no registration or identification required to use the Wall of Coins platform, and users can purchase and sell bitcoin in fifteen minutes. Bitquick is another cash-to-bitcoin operation that offers an optional identity verification process. The Bitquick platform is similar to Wall of Coins and Localbitcoins by allowing people to purchase and sell bitcoin in a peer-to-peer fashion. Sellers simply advertise their sales and buyers deposit cash into one of Bitquick’s escrow bank accounts, like Bank of America or Wells Fargo. The company uses Bitgo’s multi-signature wallet framework and also has a proof-of-reserve system. The startup has offered peer-to-peer cash trading services since 2013 and will soon be adding Moneygram and Western Union options. Identity is optional on Bitquick but is required for transactions more than US$400, and users have to submit a few documents. Bitsquare, the decentralized bitcoin exchange founded in 2014, is unique because it claims to have no central point of failure and requires no identification. The exchange offers Bitcoin trading against national currencies such as the USD, EUR, and also trades in altcoins. The platform is a desktop application where users can advertise the buying and selling of various cryptocurrencies. Users can remain completely anonymous on the platform as communication is streamlined over Tor. Bitsquare uses an escrow system, multi-signature transactions, a security deposit, and a decentralized arbitration infrastructure. Arbitrators hold one of the keys in the 2-of-3 Multisig escrow scheme. The platform has become more popular over the past year for its decentralized aspects as people continue to lose money in exchange hacks. The recent announcement of Chinese Bitcoin exchanges suspending withdrawals is just another wake-up call for those holding funds on centralized platforms. A lot of people like to remain private when purchasing and selling bitcoin. Some people don’t mind handing over licenses, bank statements and utility bills to get verified by an exchange. And there are plenty of these businesses available. However, there are those who would rather not jump through identity verification hoops. This doesn’t mean privacy advocates are using Bitcoin for illegal activity. Furthermore, people may not want their information centrally held with a third-party that could be susceptible to breaches. Customer data is a hot commodity on the black market, and identity verification and registration processes can make people’s information susceptible to breaches. Luckily for Bitcoiners, there are still places to purchase and sell bitcoin without an ID. Have you tried any of these exchanges? Let us know about your experiences below.

2017-02-11T19:00:20-04:00,Tealet is Decentralizing the Tea Industry with Bitcoin,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/decentralizing-tea-industry-bitcoin/,"Tea is the most widely consumed beverage after water. The tea industry has also, historically, been overly centralized the world over. One company wants to change this. Tealet, a wholesale tea distributor, is looking to revolutionize the tea world with modern technology. “There are several middlemen which were once necessary for the international trade of tea,” Tealet CEO Elyse Petersen explains, citing China’s Cultural Revolution and 1950s-style western consumerism for undermining tea quality worldwide in favor of mass production. “Things like Bitcoin make for a more sustainable future for this industry.” Tealet uses Bitcoin to settle with producers in eight countries. Also Read: Making ‘EthereRum’ Distilled by a Bitcoin Miner Tealet teaches farmers how to make quality tea themselves, instead of merely producing bulk green leaf by the kilogram – a practice which encouraged chemical-based agricultural practices to create more output – instead of a higher quality. Based in Las Vegas, Tealet struggled with payment options like Paypal before exploring digital currency. The company had to educate its producers on Bitcoin, all of whom choose to receive their local currency so as to maintain their family farms. The company does accept Bitcoin from the public for its bulk, whole leaf tea, as well.  “When we first started to accept Bitcoin in 2013 our sales were great and people in the community were really excited to support us,” Ms. Petersen said. Since then, sales have slowed, though the company remained engaged in the Bitcoin community. “We started paying certain invoices with Bitcoin, and we also received an angel investment in Bitcoin,” Ms. Petersen reveals. Tealet, which distributes mainly to teahouses and restaurants, doesn’t offer any ordinary tea, but, rather, whole leaf  tea in several varieties including white, green, oolong, black, puerh, and yellow. Their tea doesn’t entail the use of tea bags and the leaves can have water poured atop of them more than once. “It becomes a ritualistic process,” says Ms. Petersen. “It’s not something you make one tea bag out of. It helps you to create social experiences with friends and it can go on for hours.” Tealet has partnered with farmers in Malawi, China, Taiwan, India, Japan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, USA, and Indonesia.  For 5,000 years the majority of tea history took place in China. There have been breaks in this heritage, like during the Cultural Revolution, whereby tea production was centralized. “It made it impossible for a tea farmer to process and sell their own tea,” explains Ms. Petersen. “A Tea farmer would harvest green leaf and sell it to centralized factory by the pound. Farmers ended up impoverished, and this can still be seen today.” China’s move away from its communist history, towards the more open commercial-capitalism/communism, has bode well for tea producers. There is a growing upper middle class which appreciates quality tea. Today farmers are able to sell to consumers, and connoisseurs of fine teas are driving prices up. A similar centralization of tea production happened in the west after World War II, with companies like Lipton coming to dominate the market. “Today farmers get higher prices because the market values their product,” Ms. Petersen says. “Our transparent marketplace, as well as Bitcoin’s low fees, means the farmers can see more of the money that is rightfully theirs,” the Tealet CEO says.

The proposed legislation encourages using these technologies to benefit the local region’s tourism. Also read: Bitcoin Regulatory Guidelines Are Coming to the Philippines Slowly but surely many state governments throughout the U.S. are studying and trying to define Bitcoin and its underlying technology. Just recently, two legislators from Hawaii sponsored House Bill 1481, which aims to begin the research of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology. The bill states that the legislature has recognized “vast potential for this technology to drastically change and improve public sector operations and private industry capabilities.”     The Hawaiian representatives are planning to create a digital currency and blockchain working group. The think tank will establish a group consisting of both the public and private sector “to examine, educate, and promote best practices for enabling blockchain technology to benefit local industries, residents, and the State of Hawaii.” The legislators believe the group can best assess practices regarding blockchain technology. Alongside building the Hawaiian “Blockchain Technology and Digital Currency Working Group, ” the politicians see potential with Bitcoin and tourism. The state’s tourism relationship with Asia shows that Bitcoin use in the region is growing. “Digital currencies such as Bitcoin have broad benefits for Hawaii,” explains House Bill 1481.  “A large portion of Hawaii’s tourism market comes from Asia where the use of Bitcoin as a virtual currency is expanding. Hawaii has the unique opportunity to explore the use of blockchain technology to make it easier for visitors to consume local goods and services and to drive the tourism economy.” State representatives believe digital currencies and blockchain can enhance cyber security, retail, transportation, supply chain management, and “emerging industries including marijuana.” Cryptocurrencies and blockchain frameworks are a “novel peer to peer networking and distributed data storage technology that shifts the primary locus of control from centralized services to individuals or key holders,” details the proposed bill. Two other states have joined Hawaii by publicly revealing digital currency and blockchain legislation. North Dakota’s Senate has established Bill 2100 which aims to regulate Bitcoin. Moreover, Arizona’s House Bill 2417 wants to establish legal blockchain-based smart contracts in the court system. As for Hawaii’s digital currency and blockchain bill, it shows the representatives who drafted it are paying close attention to this technology.  The island state legislature appears to be taking a more friendly approach to Bitcoin in comparison with other U.S. states.

Citing “intense interest in the bitcoin ETFs that are going through the regulatory process”, author Spencer Bogart offers some insights into what factors the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are likely considering in order to approve or disapprove a bitcoin ETF. Also read: Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF ‘Very Low’  Investment banking and asset management firm Needham & Company focuses solely on growth companies. Since its inception, the firm has acted as lead or co-manager in over 785 public offerings. Recently, the firm received attention for estimating the chance of the SEC approving a bitcoin ETF to be less than 25%, an estimate that has not changed in this latest report entitled ‘Digging Deeper on Bitcoin ETF Filings and Potential Effect’. According to the new report, factors affecting the SEC’s decision are either specific to each ETF filing or specific to Bitcoin itself. Since any problems specific to a company’s filing could be addressed to comply with the SEC’s requirements, Needham believes that Bitcoin-specific issues are the bigger hurdle to the ETF approval. They describe these issues as revolving around “broader concerns about Bitcoin itself and whether it is a suitable asset for a broadly investable vehicle such as an ETF”. The report then proceeds to discuss two main factors which are potentially the most important to the Commission; suitability of bitcoin as the underlying asset of an ETF, and the state of the Bitcoin market. Based on their analysis, Needham believes that the Commission is considering whether a digital asset like bitcoin is a suitable underlying asset for an ETF since it is different from a commodity, security or derivative. “Furthermore, the SEC appears to also be evaluating the risk that ownership of bitcoin could, theoretically, be changed by a coordination of a majority of the network’s hashing rate”, the report explains. While reiterating that the SEC’s view may be different from their own, it is Needham’s opinion that being different from other asset classes does not make Bitcoin fundamentally unsuitable for an ETF. Bogart also noted that: “The other major group of concerns that the SEC has published revolve around market dynamics”, the report reveals, drawing attention to questions such as: “Published comments from the SEC suggest the Commission is also evaluating the risk of loss from theft and computer hacking”, the report reveals. While citing that liquidity is always a reasonable concern, Needham wrote that “there are ETFs for assets that are far less-liquid than bitcoin and these investment vehicles function well, so we don’t see any reason to disapprove on these grounds”. Regarding market manipulation, the firm sees risks in any assets, not just in bitcoin. “Even the deepest and most liquid market in the world (e.g. Gold and LIBOR) have recently been the target of sophisticated manipulation from the most highly regulated entities”, the report describes. The firm believes that market manipulation is “largely independent of the actual underlying asset”, adding that: What reasons do you think the SEC will give for its decision on a bitcoin ETF?

2017-02-11T03:00:51-04:00,Bitcoin Nostalgia: Can Some Bitcoins Be Worth More Than Others?,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-nostalgia-can-bitcoins-worth-others/,"One could assume there is a certain nostalgia towards your very first bitcoin. Perhaps someone has a memory tied to a specific transaction. Certain bitcoins can be tethered to memorable acts, have associations with people, have a unique transaction time-frame or block height, among many other attributes that can give cryptocurrency numismatic value. Also read: On Decentralization and Network Societies: An Interview With David Orban Earlier this week I emptied a Bitcoin wallet on my phone because the application was having issues with dynamic fees. As I was sending the digital currency to my cold storage device, I realized these bitcoins were dear to me. One bitcoin is based on the value others will pay for the digital asset. Yet with certain associations tied to the currency, it raises the question — can some bitcoins be worth more than others? Bitcoin has been known over the course of eight years to hold numismatic value. Numismatics is the study and collection of currencies. This includes coins, cowry shells, paper money, and many types of currency used over time, including Bitcoin. A numismatist is a person that collects currencies that have different meanings, associations, and histories. Both physical bitcoins and even its digital version can hold the characteristics of numismatic value.  Even as far back as 2011, it was noted on the Bitcointalk.org forum that someone was willing to pay 1.5 BTC for one Bitcoin that was associated with the original 2010 pizza transaction. The post in the summer of 2011 led to a discussion of whether or not certain Bitcoins can be worth more than others. One community member explained his opinion of the subject stating:   Physical Bitcoins can also hold collectible value, and probably more so than the digital form. For instance, Casascius physical bitcoins from 2011-2013 are extremely valuable. There have been instances of a single series-one Casascius selling for well over the coin’s face value. The art of collecting coinage has existed since ancient times, and this pastime has continued with physical bitcoin collecting. As the years go by, it is quite possible that older transactions or coins with tethered memories could sell for more than Bitcoin’s current spot price. Unless some sort of significant fungibility concept comes into play within the network, Bitcoin’s traceability will increase numismatic value. Moreover, an individual could also add some metadata to the Bitcoin creating another form of a colored digital currency collectible. Last year the Smithsonian opened a new exhibition at its National Numismatic Collection which included Bitcoin. Some of the first bitcoins I’ve ever owned were held on my mobile phone, and no additional transactions were ever added to the wallet. These Bitcoins may be important to me but most likely never will be worth more than the spot price to others. Do you think certain bitcoin can hold numismatic value? Do you have bitcoin nostalgia with some of your coins? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Bitcoin.com, and Pixabay.

2017-02-10T19:00:47-04:00,Pirate Party in Netherlands Determined to Keep Using Bitcoin,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/pirate-party-netherlands-bitcoin/,"The Dutch Electoral Council reportedly rejected a payment in Bitcoin from the country’s Pirate Party to participate in upcoming elections. But that won’t stop the ‘Pirates’ from using the digital currency to fight the power. The Pirate Party is an international movement represented in more than forty countries. There is a ‘Pirate’, as party members call each other, in the European Parliament and ten seats in the national parliament of Iceland. ‘Pirates’ have been elected in Germany, Austria, Switzerland and the Czech Republic, as well. It’s also a party with largely positive attitudes towards Bitcoin. Also Read: On Decentralization and Network Societies  Many Pirate Party supporters donate Bitcoin (the party also accepts another cryptocurrency, a local Dutch cryptocoin named Gulden of Guilder). The Pirate Party Netherlands recently attempted to pay the country’s Electoral Council with bitcoins. The Election Council rejected the bitcoins, and the Pirate Party had to first send the coins to an exchange and pay the fee in euros. “The party wanted to pay the 11,250 euro deposit at the Electoral Council in bitcoins, but this kind of digital currency is not accepted by the government,” Ancilla van de Leest  told Bitcoin.com. The Party converted the digital currency into euros.  Over the years, the Party’s cryptocurrency holdings have “added up,” she said. “When we needed a big chunk of money to take part in the elections, it just made sense. We quite enjoyed the opportunity to make a statement with it.” The Pirate Party Netherlands debates regularly what to do with its bitcoin holdings. “We wanted to put our bitcoin to good use,” Ms. Van de Leest explains. “So we did. It’s not accepted by our government, so we exchanged it to euros and paid with those. What matters to us is that bitcoin was donated to help us gain seats, and we’re using it for exactly that: to pay for entry into the elections.” The Pirate Party and Bitcoin share similarities. “Not only our digital roots, but also how our communities view the world and organize themselves,” Pirate Party Netherlands top candidate for Parliament says. “At the same time we see fundamental flaws with the current economic system that are absent with Bitcoin. The old economic structures are set up to be non-transparent by design and there is what’s called quantitative easing to patch over its flaws. That’s value created out of thin air and given to a selected few by those in power. It’s the same ‘money’ everybody else has to work for.” Naturally, the ‘Pirates’ share a deep distrust of the banking system with Bitcoiners.  “Central banks are not managing their issued money in a way that contributes to society as a whole,” Ms. Van de Leest, who once appeared on the cover of Dutch Playboy, opined. “One could argue the way they do their business is criminal. In addition, most issued money in the world is actually someone else’s debt and backed only by a false sense of security. When people are losing faith in their money, they are losing faith in its issuers: the central banks. This would have devastating consequences for everyone.” Pirates supports the idea of diversifying away from banks with Bitcoin.  “It puts in practice everything we strive for: decentralization of power, accountability, transparency and room for organic growth and permissionless innovation in the best ways possible,” says Ms. Van de Leest .“That the underlying code is transparent and community maintained increases its trustworthiness. That Satoshi Nakamoto has remained anonymous is very much in line with our efforts to protect those who challenge the system, such as whistleblowers.”  The financial blockade of Wikileaks donations and other such occurrences are fresh on ‘Pirates’ minds. “Money is a politically loaded subject in itself,” Ms. Van de Leest explains. “We think that future starts today and includes Bitcoin paving the way for whatever may come to join it’s path. Our internal debate is only about the number and diversity of the cryptocurrencies we accept.” Accepting bitcoin was an easy choice for the party. “Both Bitcoin and the Pirate Party are about taking control away from the middlemen and from concentrations of power,” she says. “We have used bitcoin to pay for other things directly in the past and will continue to do so in the future.”  The party even gives reimbursements in the cryptocurrency.  “Just the other day we had to reimburse one of our volunteers,” Ms. Van de Leest recalls. “He paid for our posters and flyers and asked for bitcoin instead of euros. We happily obliged.”  “We want to empower the people to make decisions as locally as possible,” Ms. Van de Leest says. “Wherever there’s a power concentration, transparency and accountability are what keep it in check. The more power, the more transparency is required. We strive to decentralize power away from companies and the government.” The Pirate Party has been celebrated by many for its stances in regards to the the digital world.  “We’re the only political party that understands the impact that the digital world and developments, like robotization and autonomous cars, will have on society and our civil rights,” she says. “The Pirate Party came from the internet, so our fundamentals are structured around a digital world. Human and Civil rights are our top priority, sadly.” Does the Pirate Party have your vote?

2017-02-10T16:00:58-04:00,Zero Knowledge Proofs & Bitcoin: The Tech Behind the Brave Browser,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/zero-knowledge-proofs-tech-behind-brave-browser/,"Brave’s open-source internet browser, which caused consternation among some newspaper publishers who threatened to sue the company, wants to simplify Bitcoin and use it to power the future internet. It plans to do this by paying publishers with bitcoin from those who spend time on their sites. Also Read: How to Defend Against Keyloggers After Your Bitcoins The Brave browser has ad-blocking technology built in and claims to offer more privacy and better speed and performance than traditional browsers. The startup, which is still in beta, strives to do this using Zero-knowledge proofs, methods by which bitcoin microtransactions can be made and confirmed while keeping both user identity and browsing history private. “It’s early days for zero-knowledge systems in cryptocurrency,” says Brave CEO Brendan Eich. “In Bitcoin, you have frictionless payments, no intermediary, no controlling custodian, and, with zero-knowledge proofs, anonymity.”  A Zero-knowledge proof or Zero-knowledge protocol (ZKP) is a cryptographic method wherein the identity of the proof bearer is separated from the authenticity or truth of the proof – the cryptographic proof requires no extra trust or knowledge to be verified by its recipient. The system used by Brave is based on Anonize. Because Bitcoin runs on a public ledger, which allows third parties to analyze and potentially triangulate and determine identities, ensuring that micropayments are in fact anonymous is not so straightforward.  “Brave will use a bitcoin payments rail, called Brave Ledger, but we are trying to use Bitcoin without being all about Bitcoin,” Mr. Eich, whose firm has raised approximately $7 million, tells Bitcoin.com. “Some thought that Brave would lead to your grandma knowing about Bitcoin,” Mr. Eich says. “But I don’t think that needs to be the case for Brave or Bitcoin to succeed. In fact, I feel the opposite is true.” Brave released its payment system in its beta version 0.11.6 in September. “For the first time in browser history, people can now seamlessly reward the sites whose content they value and wish to support while remaining anonymous and untracked,” reported Bitcoin.com.   “The simplest thing we are doing with bitcoin is helping publishers receive automated donations based on visits to their site,” explains Mr. Eich, “without Brave users have to worry ‘Do I want to support this site or that site?’” This process is carried out on a user’s native device as opposed to the server side. “We blind ourselves and all others to that donation list. Users hold custody of their funds, controlling the funds essentially through a wallet key for a multi-signature wallet. No one sees the list of websites, but bitcoin flows in aggregate to publishers.” He adds: “This is only made possible thanks to the robustness of Bitcoin, and of course the ability to send without an intermediary.” Currently, third party ads entail a website hosting intensive third-party scripts to keep track of users and try to match the best ad for a given space on the page with the user. Trackers also try to ensure that the right people get debited and credited advertising funds. This process poses a risk in terms of data. “There is a general concern about fraud with third-party ads,” says Mr. Eich. Brave, which has partnered with Coinbase, Bitgo and Private Internet Access, and believes Bitcoin can solve this problem. “The value of Bitcoin is really under the hood, but yet we couldn’t do this without Bitcoin, and that’s one of the ironies,” says Mr. Eich, who has demonstrated that Brave speeds up the load time of websites reliant on bulky third party advertising scripts by 3-6x. “We can solve problems like publisher revenue and increased browser data security, as well as protection from malware without having to get people to become Bitcoin proficient.” What do you think about the Brave browser?

Previously, they were not exempt from VAT, and some claim Bitcoin adoption in the country has been stifled due to the high tax rate. Also read: High Tax Slows Bitcoin Development In Norway  In November 2013, the Norwegian Tax Administration issued a statement that bitcoins will be treated as capital property, not a currency, for tax-related purposes. The tax authority found in the case of ‘Bruk av bitcoins – skatte- og avgiftsmessige konsekvenser, supra’ (translates into “usage of bitcoins – tax and fee consequenses”) that: The European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled in October 2015, however, that Bitcoin exchange transactions are exempt from VAT. On Monday, the Norwegian Ministry of Finance sent a letter to the country’s Tax Administration, asking them to reconsider their position regarding the Bitcoin VAT. The letter refers to the EU’s judgment to exempt Bitcoin transactions from VAT obligation under the EU’s VAT Directive and urges the tax authority to follow the ECJ’s decision in their interpretation of VAT. The translated letter reads: Following the letter by the Ministry of Finance on Wednesday, the Tax Administration changed its stance and ruled Bitcoin transactions VAT-exempt. The Minister of Finance, Siv Jensen (FRP), commented on the tax authority’s decision that “some have experienced uncertainty about the tax treatment of Bitcoin. I am very pleased that it has now come to a clarification on this question. This safeguards equal treatment and predictability.” VAT has reportedly slowed Bitcoin adoption in Norway. In December, a board member of the Norway Bitcoin Association, Therese Helland, told Bitcoin.com that local merchant adoption slowed down, and that there was “a largely untapped market within remittance.” At the same time, she named six different exchanges that Norwegians could buy bitcoins from.

Essentially the company wants people to replace their public email with an inbox that pays in bitcoin. Also read: Coinsecure’s Benson Samuel: ‘India’s Bitcoin Interest Spiking’  The San Francisco-based 21 Inc is a company that’s focused on utilizing Bitcoin for a wide array of applications including big data, hardware, the Internet of Things (IoT), and now a social email platform. The newly launched service is similar to Linkedin’s Inmail system which enables users to pay Linkedin to forward an email to people they are not connected with, but would like to contact. In contrast to Linkedin’s platform, 21 Inc’s service pays the recipient of the email and the company charges the sender an additional 10 percent fee. The email application that compensates recipients is available for both mobile and desktop operating systems. “Replace your public email with an inbox that pays you,” explains 21 Inc. “Set up a 21 profile to receive paid messages from people outside your network. Keep the money, or donate it to charities. It’s like Linkedin Inmail, except you get paid. — Recruiters, salespeople, and companies can now send paid messages to compensate you for your time.” The new service also pays users to participate in surveys that reward people with bitcoin after completing the tasks. Users can send their earnings to another wallet immediately, but 21 Inc also gives a list of charities where people can donate their funds instead. Charities include nonprofits such as Black Girls Code, Stanford University’s Folding program, and Coincenter. On the sending side, the prices to make contact with someone can vary depending on the person. For instance contacting Ben Horowitz, the general partner of the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, costs US$100. Then there are many other profiles from companies such as Comcast Ventures, Angel List, Qualcomm, and Google Ventures. The idea enables recipients to get compensated for their time but also allows a connection that may prove fruitful. The concept could be useful to a founder of a startup looking for seed funding or someone trying to create a new partnership. The new email service adds to the growing list of 21 Inc’s Bitcoin-related platforms that include its 21 computer, library tutorials, and its fee-market and node data feeds. The company founded in 2013 by Balaji S. Srinivasan, Matt Pauker, Veerbhan Kheterpal, Nigel Drego, and Daniel Firu has been testing different types of platforms since 2015. Alongside this, investors have had high expectations for the young startup, injecting $121 million into the company’s coffers. The company which has been continuously changing may be pivoting its focal points in order to find a niche market within the Bitcoin industry. 21 Inc seems to think users will be interested in its paying inbox application. “Get a response from some of the most important people in tech.

2017-02-09T19:00:20-04:00,Bitcoin Helps to Put Slovenia Fintech Scene on the Map,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-helps-slovenia-fintech-scene-map/,"Slovenia’s Bitcoin scene is the second largest in Europe based on Google search queries. According to Google Trends, the central European nation ranks fourth in Google search queries for ‘bitcoin,’ behind Estonia and nestled between several African nations. Slovenia is home to one of Bitcoin’s largest exchanges, Bitstamp.  Some say the nation of two million, located at the crossroads of European cultural and trade routes, has become known in financial technology circles thanks to its emergence as a Bitcoin powerhouse. Also Read: ESMA Won’t Ban Blockchain, Considers Regulation Premature “Bitcoin is much better known in Slovenia compared to most other Countries,” says Peter Trcek, CEO of Bitnik, a Slovenian Bitcoin services provider. “Almost everybody has heard of it. While not all sentiments are positive, there has been fewer negative reactions, even amongst media and financial institutions, lately.” Mr. Trcek explains being part of an integrated Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA), and having a population with some knowledge of cryptocurrencies, means many fintech experts call Slovenia home. The nation – bordered by Italy, Austria, Hungary, Croatia and the Adriatic Sea – has experienced increased popularity in ‘blockchain’ as a buzzword lately, as elsewhere around the globe. Bitstamp CEO Nejc Kodrič, and his co-founder Damijan Merlak, credit Bitcoin with helping to put Slovenia on the map as a financial technology center. The majority of Bitstamp development and management is located in Slovenia, which is home to seven bitcoin ATMs altogether. Instead of staying in their home country, many Slovenians have sought greener pastures abroad in which to make an impact in financial technology. “Then there are the two of us – two hardcore libertarian, tech enthusiasts who dove into the world of Bitcoin, as well as many others,” Mr. Kodrič told Bitcoin.com. “Our company is quite known here for having achieved this small miracle of being a financial company out of Slovenia, and to have success globally in Slovenia.” He credits other Slovenian Bitcoin companies, as well, like Bitnik, Cashila and Iconomi, with turning Slovenia into a fintech center of the distributed sort. A little over 60% of Bitstamp clients are from Europe, and the exchange allows users to deposit money via the SEPA, thanks to Slovenia’s membership in the arrangement. Bitstamp, which this year added Ripple’s XRP trading to its platform and the option to pay with credit card for bitcoins in 57 nations, was originally founded as a European-focused alternative to the then dominant Mt. Gox. “We see adoption from the south, Baltic, and especially Scandinavian countries,” Mr. Kodrič told Bitcoin.com. “There is a correlation with linguistic knowledge of nordic countries, who speak more English than the southern countries, where in 2013 there was next to no articles in the native languages.” Mr. Kodrič contends Bitstamp is known in the nation because Bitcoin is known. “To operate one of largest exchanges out of Slovenia, as Slovenians is something novel to Bitcoin,” he says. “Its users all start from same starting point in tech. Whether you’re Indian or in Silicon Valley, it doesn’t matter. Everyone has the same tools available regardless of where in the world they’re located. Because the tech is so decentralized, we had same chance to succeed as anyone else.” Bitstamp, the nineteenth most searched query worldwide related to Bitcoin according to Google, is licensed for all European Union countries. It’s registered in Luxembourg for that country’s clearer regulatory framework than Slovenia, but this is steadily changing.  Slovenia recently updated its main anti-money laundering law (AML). Cryptocurrencies are defined in the law, and all crypto exchanges and brokers are explicitly defined as financial institutions for AML purposes. “There are not many jurisdictions at the moment where cryptocurrencies are so well-defined by the regulator,” says Mr. Trcek. “Local meetups sometimes attract interesting attendees. From employees of main tax office to representatives of the central bank of Slovenia.” Such regulations lend legitimacy to people’s perceptions of Bitcoin, the Bitnik CEO suggests. “Pairing services like ours with banks and other financial institutions requires complex new procedures to be enforceable, not just recommended as before,” acknowledges Mr. Trcek. “We view stricter AML regulations as a good thing. Besides further legitimizing the business model it forces us to find novel solutions. Solutions that we might ‘export’ abroad once their regulation catches up.”

2017-02-09T06:00:15-04:00,Bitcoin’s Price Resilient After PBOC Met With Nine More Exchanges,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-price-resilient-pboc-met-nine-exchanges/,"The People’s Bank of China (PBOC) issued a statement on Thursday regarding a meeting it held the previous day with nine Chinese bitcoin exchanges. When the news of the meeting broke, the price of bitcoin dropped almost six percent but quickly regained its high only hours later, and has continued to rise. Also read: Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Inspections Cause Price Drop and FUD  The PBOC’s statement posted on its website on Thursday states that its Business Management Department was meeting with the main persons in charge of nine bitcoin exchanges on Wednesday. The nine exchanges invited were Chbtc, Btctrade, Haobtc, Yunbi, Yuanbao, BTC100, Jubi, Bitbay and Dahonghuo. According to a translation of the statement, the central bank informed those
exchanges of existing problems, and potential legal, regulatory, as well as technical risks. The exchanges were subsequently required “not to take part in financial activities such as margin lending or allow money laundering”, Reuters translated. In addition, they cannot violate laws concerning anti-money laundering (AML), foreign currency payments and management, or violate regulations about taxes and commercial advertisements. Any exchanges that are found to be in serious violation of those requirements can be closed down, the central bank states. When the news about the meeting broke, roughly a day before the PBOC’s announcement was posted, the price of bitcoin dropped $60 USD on Bitfinex from $1,066 to $1,006 in under an hour. However, it soon rebounded completely, and 19 hours and twenty minutes later, the price had overtaken its previous level.  There have been three noticeable drops in bitcoin’s price coinciding with the PBOC’s actions this year, each progressively less influential. The First Drop The first one started on January 5, when the price of bitcoin was at a three-year high of $1,166 on Bitfinex. The exchange’s all time high was $1,175 on December 1, 2013, and that level has yet to be reached again.  The first of the three price drops took a few days to reach bottom after the PBOC made a pair of statements on its website saying that its officials have met with the heads of BTCChina, Huobi, and OKCoin to discuss their business models and products. No ban was made but the price dropped to $815 over the next day, only rebounding partially before the next piece of PBOC-related news made headlines. The Second Drop The second price drop occurred on January 11, when the PBOC launched spot checks on China’s same top three bitcoin exchanges. Some media outlets called the action a “raid,” but BTCChina took to twitter to dispel the myth, and set the story straight. During the meeting, the price of a bitcoin plunged from $924 to $735, a fall of over 20 percent, rebounding to $790 by the end of the day. In the aftermath, it became known that the Chinese exchanges would have to put an end to their practice of allowing zero-fee and margin trading, both of which are known to artificially boost trading volumes. The three exchanges subsequently confirmed that they had stopped offering margin loans after the discussion with the PBOC. The Third Drop The Wednesday drop was far smaller than the previous two and came at a time when the yuan is no longer the currency with the largest bitcoin trading volume. Ever since the January 11 inspections, China’s share of global bitcoin trade has fallen from 99 percent to a mere 33 percent, allowing Japanese yen trading to surpass Chinese trading volumes for the first time. The nine exchanges mentioned in Thursday’s notice from the PBOC do not include the original three mentioned above. There are also at least 19 bitcoin exchanges trading the yuan with daily volume, including a couple based outside of the country. The PBOC made its intention clear in a January 25 announcement to continue inspecting bitcoin exchanges, so more of these routine meetings could be expected.

2017-02-08T19:00:05-04:00,Bitcoin Startups Form Association After Indiaâs Virtual Currency Warning,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-startups-association-reserve-bank-indias-virtual-currency-warning/,"Following last weekâs warning aboutÂ virtual currencies including bitcoin by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), four bitcoin startups have formed an association aimed to engage with regulators. Also read:Â Coinsecureâs Benson Samuel: âIndiaâs Bitcoin Interest SpikingâÂ  Zebpay, Unocoin, Coinsecure and Searchtrade areÂ in the process of registering their newly formed ‘Blockchain and Virtual currency Association of India’. The three local bitcoin exchanges and the Singapore-based Bitcoin search revenue-share company met for the first time in Mumbai on Friday. Among topics they discussed was the recent RBIâs warning regarding digital currencies. The Association was formed “just last Friday but it hasÂ yet to get formally registered”, Sathvik Vishwanath, Unocoin co-founder and CEO, told Bitcoin.com. The new association hopes to achieve “uniformity in self-regulation and lobbying with the regulators regarding Bitcoin and blockchain technology”, he explained, adding that initially the Association will be “only for businesses and then we may open up for individuals as well”. Also important to the group is making bitcoin trading safe in India by ensuring members follow strong know your customer (KYC) regulations, as well as helping educate theirÂ customers about Ponzi schemes and other risks associated with digital currencies. In 2014, there was a previous Bitcoin association in India called the Bitcoin Alliance of India which is now defunct. According to the CEO of bitcoin exchange Coinsecure, Mohit Kalra, this association failed because Bitcoin companies were still small at the time. Saurabh Agarwal, co-founder of Bitcoin trading and wallet company Zebpay said âwe had thought of reviving the old association – Bitcoin Alliance of Indiaâ, however the four founding companies decided to include blockchain companies with Bitcoin in order to âcreate a larger associationâ. He noted âwhile we have been planning to create an association for some time, we finally pushed things after the circular.â The association formed in part as a response to the latest notice about digital currencies issued by the RBI, which came February 1. Posted on their website, it cautions users, holders and traders of virtual currencies including bitcoins âabout the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection and security related risks that they are exposing themselves toâ. The RBI wrote: This recent notice also referenced the December 2013 notice which was the last time the RBI issued a guidance regarding digital currencies. Although Bitcoin has never been banned in India, the RBI curbed the growth of the small Bitcoin community at that time by proclaiming that the creation, trade, and usage of digital currencies as a medium of payment is not authorized by banks and the monetary authority in India. They also warned citizens about digital currencies being prone to loss, and mentioned several impending threats to their bitcoins, including volatility, cyberattacks, and the likelihood of them being used for illegal activities. In addition, according to Nishith Desai, a lawyer and advisor to the Association, the government is also âcreating a regulatory board specifically for digital payments and BVAI requests to include regularization of virtual currencies in the sameâ. At press time, the 24-hour trading volume between the Indian rupee and bitcoin is approximately 521 bitcoins, based on data from Coinhills. The site ranks the rupee as the fourteenth-most traded currency for bitcoin. Localbitcoins, which has the fourth-highest volume of any exchange in the country, has been showing rise in trading volume in both the Indian rupee and in bitcoin.  The association is launching at a perilous time in India. The Indian banknote demonetization last November caused a massive struggle for the poor and middle classes across the country, leading some to turn to bitcoin as a hedge against monetary strife. A major spike in volume across bitcoin exchanges and Localbitcoins was seen at the time, and today Indians are still dealing with the consequences of that program.

2017-02-08T09:00:56-04:00,Bitcoin Regulatory Guidelines Are Coming to the Philippines,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-regulatory-guidelines-philippines/,"Many governments around the world are preparing regulatory policies concerning cryptocurrency markets. The Philippines is now next in line to regulate Bitcoin operations as the central bank deputy governor, Nestor Espenilla, has revealed new virtual currency guidelines. Also read: Mainstream Investors Are Hearing A lot About Bitcoin Bitcoin.com reported last June that the Philippines central bank, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP), was preparing new guidelines towards Bitcoin companies in the region. Now the BSP deputy governor, Nestor Espenilla, has published a circular (BSP Circular №944) that defines the government’s position concerning Bitcoin operations. In the document, the BSP states that it aims to regulate virtual currencies that apply to all payment systems and remittance platforms. Basically, it applies to any operation that may have “material impact on anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT), consumer protection and financial stability,” explains the BSP. The central bank will begin implementing the rules and regulations that govern operations of virtual currency exchanges in two weeks. The BSP circular notes that the new guidelines are not endorsements of bitcoin and other digital currencies. However, the Bank does recognize that virtual currency solutions have great potential. The deputy governor’s circular states: Following the recent BSP circular announcement, Bitcoin remittance expert Luis Buenaventura revealed his opinion of the central bank’s definitions and policies. Buenaventura has done extensive research on Bitcoin’s relationship with global remittances by studying strategies and startups in the crypto-remittance space like Bitspark and Abra. In his opinion, the latest guidelines in the Philippines define all virtual currency exchanges to be treated as remittance companies. “It certainly appears like the intention is to treat any business dealing with Bitcoin as a remittance agent, even if remittances aren’t the primary purpose of that company,” explains Buenaventura. The Bitcoin industry within the Philippines will have to wait and see how these policies take effect in the country. Buenaventura says bitcoin exchanges and remittance startups have made a lot of progress since 2013, but still have a long way to go. Furthermore, he’s encouraged that the BSP spent a lot of time learning about Bitcoin, but the central bank has “vastly overestimated how much of it is actually used for remittances.” “From one angle, it’s good news that the government is finally recognizing that we exist and acknowledge that our efforts do have a positive social impact on our country,” Buenaventura adds.

2017-02-08T06:00:38-04:00,Each Bug Found is Worth Up To 10 Bitcoins at Popular Dark Net Market Hansa,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/each-bug-found-worth-10-bitcoins-dark-net-market-hansa/,"The third most popular dark net market, Hansa, has recently announced a bug bounty program which offers rewards of up to ten bitcoins for each vulnerability found in its marketplace. Also read: FBI Releases ‘Primer’ Successfully Infiltrating Darknets  Hansa Market’s bug bounty program offers rewards of up to ten bitcoins (worth over $10,200 at press time) for each security hole or other problem found. Open to anyone, users can anonymously submit bugs found on the site and get paid when they are patched. There are three levels of vulnerabilities that Hansa Market is considering. Those that could “severely disrupt” the integrity of user or vendor information reel in the biggest reward of ten bitcoins per bug found. Noncritical vulnerabilities that could only take the marketplace down temporarily earn their finders a one bitcoin bounty. In addition, for “simple display bugs or unintended behavior” which are non-critical but could lessen the user experience, Hansa Market offers 0.05 bitcoin, about $52 each at today’s price. Each submitter has to “demonstrate a security compromise on our market using a reproducible exploit” in order to win a bounty, then enter a customer support ticket detailing it. At press time, two developers have publicly announced on Hansa Market’s Reddit page that they have submitted bug findings to the marketplace. As darknet markets grow in popularity, marketplace security vulnerabilities are being increasingly exploited. Last month, for example, two bugs were exposed on Alphabay, the largest darknet market with the most products and users. One bug exposed over 218,000 personal messages sent between their users within the previous 30 days, while the other allowed the hacker to obtain a list of all usernames and their respective user IDs. “The attacker was paid for his findings, and agreed to tell us the methods used to extract such information,” said Alphabay admins, and the company immediately fixed the bugs. Shortly after, the same hacker found a bug in Hansa Market which allowed him to compile a list of the market’s usernames. Launched in July 2015, Hansa Market is the third-most popular dark net market, according to cyber risk intelligence company SurfWatch Labs. At press time, there are 32,895 products and services showing in the marketplace. According to Deepdotweb, Hansa Market has the fourth largest selection of goods and the fourth most reviews among ranked dark web markets. It has 98 ratings with 4.3 stars, which is a higher rating than other sites ranked, including Alphabay and Dream Market. Hansa Market takes a 3% commission on all sales and requires a 0.3 BTC bond for vendors. The marketplace reportedly facilitated over $3 million worth of sales between September 2015 and December 2016. One of Hansa Market’s methods to minimizing scams includes using multisignature addresses. Previously, most dark web markets used only a standard Bitcoin address for their escrow account. After customers deposited money into it, the site administrator would wait to hear from both parties before releasing the funds. While sounding good in theory, this arrangement allows the marketplace’s administrator to perform an ‘exit scam’, which is when they disappear with all of the money in the site’s many escrow accounts, never to be heard from again. Unfortunately, this has been a common occurrence in darknet markets. Hansa Market uses 2-of-3 multisignature wallets, so that the customer, the vendor, and Hansa admins all receive a Bitcoin private key for each sale. The money is released to the vendor, or sent back to the buyer, only when two of the three keys are used to move the money. According to its website, the marketplace’s primary focus is to minimize scam opportunities for vendors and market admins alike, adding that: What do you think Hansa Market’s bug bounty program?

2017-02-08T01:00:26-04:00,Bitcoin Trading in Chinese Yuan Drops to One-Third of Market in 30 Days,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/china-bitcoin-volume-2017/,"China’s big three exchanges announced they would end zero fee trades and margin trading Tuesday due to increased scrutiny by the People’s Bank of China (PBOC), leading to a collapse in Chinese bitcoin trading volumes. The changes come on the heels of Beijing’s implementation of new capital controls in 2016. Also Read: China’s Smart Money is Staying in Bitcoin This Time In late January, China’s big three bitcoin exchanges – BTCC, OKCoin, and Huobi – agreed informally to charge 0.2% fees on both sides of bitcoin-denominated trades. Since the announcement of the fees, to be implemented Tuesday, China’s bitcoin volumes have collapsed. Once comprising 99% of bitcoin trades, the market share has collapsed to 33% in one month, according to Bitcoin data website Bitcoinity, compiled by Chris Burniske of Ark Invest.    Below, the drop in terms of Chinese Yuan can be seen:  And in Bitcoin:  The PBOC alleged that Chinese Bitcoin exchanges had operated outside their legal business scope by offering zero fee trading, which fueled speculation in the digital currency market. In a statement, the bank cited “margin trading which violated rules, resulting in abnormal price fluctuations on the market.” The PBOC inspectors also noted the exchanges had failed to develop anti-money laundering policies and that “preliminary inspections demonstrated that BTCC operates beyond its business scope by offering loans which violate rules.” PBOC said on January 25, it would pursue further inspections, and that investors should continue heeding possible risks of using the Chinese exchanges and invest carefully. The 0.2% trading fees go into effect Tuesday in China, according to statements released on BTCC, Huobi and OKCoin websites. The statements highlighted the move would “further curb market manipulation and extreme volatility.” BTCC Bobby Lee said the move by exchanges to institute trading fees was made in anticipation of future Chinese Bitcoin guidelines. PBOC perlustration hasn’t precluded the development of increasingly sophisticated bitcoin financial products. Hong Kong-based Bitcoin company First Global Credit announced Monday the addition of Chinese stocks backed by Bitcoin as collateral, covering Hong Kong-based companies, as well as 30 mainland China-based companies traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange. Further, the PBOC announced it would open a digital currency research institute after the New Year Holiday to test blockchain technology. In late June 2016, Chainalysis data demonstrated that 42 percent of all Bitcoin transactions took place in China during the first half of last year. In 2017, Bitcoin reached $1,000 on January 1 before consolidating. The price surpassed the four-digit mark once more, amid “dizzying” trading patterns, as the nation celebrated the ‘Day to Welcome the God of Wealth,’ part of Lunar New Year celebrations."
2017-02-07T21:00:34-04:00,Countdown: Bitcoin Will Be a Legal Method of Payment in Japan in Two Months,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/countdown-bitcoin-legal-payment-japan-two-months/,"Bitcoin will soon be legally recognized as a method of payment in Japan. The bill with provisions for cryptocurrencies has recently passed through the period of public consultation and will enter into force in April. Also read: Coincheck’s Growth Reveals Surging Japanese Bitcoin Trade Bitcoin.com examines what the bill means and how it could affect Bitcoin with Special Counsel at Anderson Mori & Tomotsune, Ken Kawai, who has held numerous speaking engagements on the legal issues of virtual currency regulations in Japan. Since Bitcoin’s inception, its legal position in Japan has not been clear. The first bill containing provisions for virtual currencies including Bitcoin was submitted to the Diet last March. It amends the existing Payment Services Act and the Act on Preventing of Transfer of Criminal Proceeds. “The revision of the Payment Services Act, which sets out the basic framework of virtual currency regulation, was promulgated last June”, Kawai told Bitcoin.com. The drafts of detailed regulations and guidelines were published in December and the period for public consultation on the bill ended on January 27, he continued, adding that: This bill defines virtual currencies including bitcoin and imposes certain regulations on virtual currency exchange services with the aim to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing as well as to protect users. While the bill recognizes them as a new method of payment in Japan, virtual currencies are not classified as “currencies” however. Kawai confirmed: Even though Bitcoin is not considered a currency, being recognized by the government as a payment method will “likely have a positive effect on people’s mind and facilitate usage of VC’s [virtual currencies]”, he believes. Bitcoin usage has already been growing considerably in Japan. Japanese exchange Coincheck revealed significant growth in its user base, rising from 14,000 users last April to 76,400 in January. In addition, the exchange reported gigantic growth in the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants using its service. Also, Japanese giant GMO Internet group has recently announced that it would be developing a bitcoin exchange and wallet service. Meanwhile, Japan now has the second-largest bitcoin trading volume globally, according to Coinhills. While usage as a payment method should not be affected whether bitcoin is legally considered a ‘currency’ or not, Kawai explained that, from a legal standpoint, there are some considerable differences. “For instance, if they are defined as “currencies”, lending of VCs must comply with Money Lending Control Act (which requires lenders to register as “Moneylenders”) and VCs’ derivatives must comply with the Financial Instrument Exchange Act”, he described. Some other countries have classified virtual currency as an asset or property for tax purposes such as the U.S. Recently, Israel has issued a draft which considers Bitcoin an asset, therefore imposing Value Added Tax (VAT) as well as capital gains tax on bitcoin transactions. However, for Japan, this bill does not define virtual currency as “property”. Instead, virtual currencies are defined as ‘proprietary value’, Kawai contrasted, adding that “a precedent of Tokyo District Court denies the concept of having ‘property rights’ of Bitcoin”. Furthermore, “it is not uncertain what is the legal nature of proprietary value in Japanese civil laws”, he clarified, adding that “I do not expect that the government is leaning towards proactively considering it as “property”. Do you think Bitcoin adoption in Japan will explode when this bill becomes law? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-02-07T19:00:50-04:00,Bitcoin Observers Watch Segwit Signaling Begin on the Litecoin Network,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-observers-segwit-signaling-litecoin-network/,"In the past, some have called Litecoin the “silver to Bitcoin’s gold.” Now many Bitcoin proponents are eagerly watching Litecoin as miners have just begun signaling for Segregated Witness (Segwit). Bitcoin community members hope Litecoin’s Segwit implementation may show a silver lining beneath the ongoing scaling debate. Also Read: How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost On February 3, the Litecoin mining community began to signal for Segwit integration. The upgrade claims to bring a few enhancements, fix malleability, and may even optimize block size capacity. This, in turn, could lead to more transactions processed per block and speed up the digital currency’s transaction queue. Furthermore, integrating Segwit will allow for the Lightning Network to be applied to the Litecoin protocol as well. Currently, people can watch the altcoin’s miners signal for Segwit here to see if and when it reaches a threshold of 75 percent of total consensus. At the time of writing, 11.45 percent of the Litecoin network’s miners support the change. While visiting the Litecoin community’s subreddit, a good majority of people seem to be excited and support the Segwit integration. Moreover, Litecoin developers and the cryptocurrency’s creator Charlie Lee have also endorsed the soft fork. “So you may wonder why I’m pushing for Segwit,” explains Charlie Lee in January. Litecoin does not have a block size problem. — But with Segwit and Bitcoin’s current block scaling deadlock, I see a potential for Litecoin to help Bitcoin break through this deadlock. Litecoin can take a lead and be a positive force in the cryptocurrency space. We have been drafting behind the Bitcoin race car for many years. It’s about time to take a turn out front.” Litecoin has been considered by many to be the strongest blockchain, second only to Bitcoin’s hashrate and security. The protocol which is nearly identical to Bitcoin was released into the wild via Github by Charlie Lee in October 2011. Since then, the network has gained a significantly sized hashrate which is 2,973 GH/s at press time. Lee believes the experiment of using Litecoin’s significantly sized network is an excellent testbed.    It’s safe to say that a good portion of the cryptocurrency community will be observing this test with Segwit and Litecoin. However, it may be a while before the Litecoin network of miners reaches 75 percent approval but if it does, Segwit will become part of the protocol. The threshold of 75 percent is lower than Bitcoin’s current 95 percent which is required for Bitcoin Segwit integration.  Currently, Segwit support is hovering around the 23 percent range within the Bitcoin network. Meanwhile, smaller mining factions like BTCTop, GBminers, Viabtc, and more have been gaining more hashrate and supporting the alternative client Bitcoin Unlimited. While waiting for consensus, many Bitcoin users have been annoyed by the recent transaction backlog. On February 3, 896,000 BTC worth of transactions were stuck in the mempool and Bitcoin’s transaction queue was slammed for over 24 hours. Watching Litecoin deploy Segwit may bring hope for some but may not be fast enough in the eyes of others.   What do you think about Litecoin’s move to implement Segwit?

2017-02-07T12:00:44-04:00,"Bitcoin, Stop Apologizing for Victimless Crime",Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-stop-apologizing-for-victimless-crime/,"Bitcoin is a freedom currency in a manner that isn’t obvious and which is virtually undiscussed. Bitcoin is commonly linked to victimless crime, but the dynamic reaches far deeper than merely freeing individuals to buy goods and services, unsavory or not. Victimless crime is the lifeblood of the surveillance state without which big government could not function. Victimless crime creates the surveillance state. Also read: Surbitcoin On Hiatus Amid Venezuela Bitcoin Crackdown The arch enemy of total scrutiny is the privacy and economic anonymity of cash or digital currencies. This means something as tiny as the pseudonymous transfer of one bitcoin is a threat to the state’s very existence. Daniel Krawisz of the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute was nothing more than deadpan accurate in a 2014 presentation in which he stated, “Someone who promotes bitcoin who is not an anarchist is a crypto-anarchist because bitcoin is inherently anarchistic.” A victimless crime is an illegal act that violates no rights and harms only the people who voluntarily commit it. And, then, the harm is only in some cases like drug use. And, then, only in the opinion of some people who are not necessarily involved. Politically speaking, victimless crimes are also the engine that drives the total surveillance state. Why is this true? When a crime has flesh-and-blood victims, they almost always contact law enforcement because they want restitution, justice or protection. A mugged man files a police report on the chance of getting his wallet back; a raped woman views a police lineup in the hope of finding justice; a shop owner turns in the video of a theft so that a neighborhood thug won’t steal from him again. Law enforcement doesn’t need to ferret out such crimes. The police can sit in one place, have victims come to them and only then investigate. If the victims prefer to remain silent, then the police have little incentive to investigate a crime with no report. Victimless ‘crimes’ are the antithesis. The criminal acts are either consensual, like prostitution, or they are committed in isolation, like drug use. In either case, the police are neither contacted nor welcomed. No one turns himself in for buying a blow job; no one files a complaint on himself for snorting cocaine. These crimes do not come and knock on the police station door. To enforce victimless laws, therefore, the authorities must hunt down the hidden scofflaws by monitoring the general population for suspicious behavior. They track the movement of money, create massive databases, eavesdrop on all communications, employ snitches and use a multitude of other intrusive tools of surveillance. The incredible violation of privacy and personal rights is justified by the politically useful issues of illegal drugs, prostitution, and other moral hot buttons. Actual acts of violence such as child pornography and the funding of terrorism are thrown into the mix. The argument is this: because of a small number of hidden bad actors, everyone everywhere must relinquish their freedom and wealth to the state. In more basic terms: the further law enforcement moves away from real victims and toward victimless crimes, the more it becomes a police state that relies on total surveillance. The state knows this. And, so, anything that blocks surveillance runs the risk of also becoming “a victimless crime.” For example, the refusal to fill out a census form is criminalized. Many people are puzzled by why the state penalizes such an innocuous act. They shouldn’t be. In his book Seeing Like a State, James C. Scott commented, “If we imagine a state that has no reliable means of enumerating and locating its population, gauging its wealth, and mapping its land, resources, and settlements, we are imagining a state whose interventions in that society are necessarily crude.” Imagine a state that could not find your children to draft or your bank account to freeze. That state could not regulate your business or arrest you for peaceful but deviant practices. Acquiring data allowed the modern state to grow. The more data, the more powerful and effective its authority. It is no coincidence that prison populations within America have risen by close to five times the level of 1980 when the war on drugs heated up. At this point, nearly 86% of federal prisoners are victimless criminals. The surveillance state has grown in pace. Appeals to compassion or common sense regarding prisoners have fallen on deaf ears because victimless crime laws serve their purpose: power and social control, which verge on being synonyms. The term is no longer fashionable, perhaps because it highlights that people who commit no harm are being punished. The preferred term is now “crimes against society.” The shift in language casts society in the role of an individual who can be robbed, raped or assaulted and so must be protected by the state. This is why criminal proceedings list the state as the ‘plaintiff’ even when the real victim is known. The victimization of society occurs whenever an individual peacefully transfers his own money in an unapproved manner because 1) “who knows where that money came from or goes,” and 2) it is not taxed or otherwise skimmed by the state and banks. In reality, of course, victimless crimes are not committed against society but against the state. They are a modern version of “crimes against the crown” – that is, a form of treason. The faux crimes are used to justify an ever-expanding surveillance system which forms the core of totalitarianism. They are so essential to state power that actual crimes, such as assault or theft, are often punished lightly compared to the ‘crimes’ of disloyalty to the state. Then, into the scene, bitcoin blunders like the proverbial bull in a china shop. Or so it must seem to central planners. To paraphrase John Lennon, “bitcoin is what happens when the state is making other plans.” The state’s response is a campaign of slander; bitcoin is child porn, money laundering, human trafficking…fill a despicable word into the blank. What is the best response? Stop apologizing. There are people who use bitcoin to buy ‘immoral goods’ (whatever that means) just as there are people who use cash to do so. As long as the participants are consenting adults, that’s their business. Not yours, not mine. The state is the one who interjects violence and harm when it points a gun at peaceful adults. Stop apologizing. The attack on bitcoin will be framed in moral terms. It will be cast as a way to protect vulnerable and misguided individuals who use their own bodies in ‘unacceptable’ ways. Or it will unfold as a campaign of resentment against those individuals who do not pay their so-called “fair share” toward maintaining the surveillance state. A moral attack must be met with moral indignation, not an apology. For one thing, an apology is an admission of guilt. The banner of bitcoin should read: “No victim. No crime. No apology.” If an individual is victimized by fraud or violence connected to bitcoin, then law enforcement should do their job and solve an actual crime.

2017-02-07T06:00:50-04:00,Chandler Guo’s Mining Pool to Support Bitcoin Unlimited,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/chandler-guos-mining-pool-support-bitcoin-unlimited/,"Over the past few weeks, support for the Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) proposal has increased significantly. This is due to a bunch of smaller mining pools collectively running the alternative client that removes the current block size cap. Now its seems the proposal will get even more hash power as the Chinese miner, Chandler Guo, has announced that his new mining pool will support the BU protocol. Also read: Smaller Pools Are Diversifying the Bitcoin Mining Industry All eyes have been focused on two Bitcoin protocol proposals that many hope will help the network scale into the future. Currently, the Segregated Witness (Segwit) implementation has 23.3 percent of support from mining pools, and this percentage has been hovering in this range for quite some time. Meanwhile, BU has steadily gained 22 percent of mining pool support, and its adoption rate has increased considerably over the past two months. Mining pools such as Viabtc, BTCtop, GBminers, and more have been expressly pushing the BU protocol forward. As BU support has been gaining momentum, on February 6 the Chinese miner, Chandler Guo, surprisingly announced that his new pool would support the BU client. Guo says the official announcement of his X pool embracing BU will come later in the day, but the news has already spread like wildfire.  According to a translated post on the Chinese forum 8btc, Guo says he plans to raise 12 million Ethereum Classic (ETC) in order to add 100 petahashes to his X Pool Bitcoin mining operation. It seems the plan is to start an ICO consisting of 21 million tokens that will be issued to the public. The additional hash power would give Guo’s X Pool roughly 3.3 percent of the overall Bitcoin network. At press time, X Pool encompasses roughly 0.9 percent of the network’s hashrate distribution.  Over the past month or so, the block size debate has been polarized by the choice between Segwit and BU. Lots of discussions have been taking place between Bitcoin community members across various forums concerning which is the best solution for scaling. Segwit support has been seemingly stagnate for a while now as the soft fork’s mining pool backing percentage hasn’t moved very much. On the other hand, BU support has grown because some of the smaller mining operations have been gathering more hash power. Over the past week, the mining pool Viabtc’s hashrate has increased significantly, capturing 10-12% of the network. It’s going to take some time watching this hashrate voting procedure unfold, and consensus is still far off the beaten path. However, people are taking action as things move along and something is sure to come out of these protocol proposals and subsequent discussions. If Chandler Guo’s X Pool adds 3.3 percent of the network hashrate towards BU, the client will be one step closer to accomplishing its goal.

2017-02-06T19:00:35-04:00,This Key Bitcoin Indicator is Dropping Like a Rock,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/key-bitcoin-indicator-dropping-rock/,"Bitcoin volatility has fallen since 2011 and compared to the U.S. dollar currently sits at about 3-4 times higher than the Japanese yen, British pound, and euro. High volatility in the digital currency space has long been cited as a reason against adoption. But, as charts and analysis demonstrate, it is very likely that Bitcoin volatility is trending downwards, even as volatility in other cryptocurrencies remain high.  The Bitcoin industry generally highlights key indicators like price, transaction volume, bitcoin wallet numbers and trading volumes to underscore Bitcoin’s increasing popularity. All of these factors have jumped in recent years. But Bitcoin’s volatility has fallen, now sitting at approximately 5%. For comparison, gold volatility averages approximately 1.2% and major fiat currencies between 0.5% and 1.0%. Also Read: How Bitcoin Apps Help People Survive Emerging Market Volatility Bitcoin’s volatility, a measure of how much its price varies over time, has long been cited as the digital currency’s downfall. Each day, Bitcoin’s value goes up or down – and oftentimes both. Measuring volatility is important to judging an asset’s overall risk profile. High volatility is cited as to why sophisticated investors and the mainstream public stay away from Bitcoin.  Investors generally limit exposure to volatile assets by not holding them or hedging. Hedging Bitcoin is tough due to a dearth of options to short Bitcoin. Further, the more volatile an asset, the more expensive it is to hedge.  There are external factors which could contribute to currency-pair volatility like fiscal policy, geopolitical disruption and other factors. Bitcoin volatility could also be a function of transaction volume, as some suggest. A paper published in 2014 by University of Victoria researchers examined the relationship between Bitcoin volatility and Google searches is implied. “Changes in Google Trends have an effect on the realized volatility of Bitcoin,” according to the paper. According to the paper, changes in the volatility of Bitcoin also have an effect on Google searches for Bitcoin. “An increase in Google Trends has a positive impact on volatility, and an increase in volatility has a positive impact on Google Trends,” states the research team, led by Darryl C. Davies. In the past year, this has proven untrue, as an increase in Bitcoin search queries has paralleled a decrease in volatility.   An end to zero fee futures trading in China has led some to speculate Bitcoin volatility will decrease in the coming months and years. When the change was announced, Bitcoin trading volume crashed 90%. In fact, most volatility so far in 2017 is credited to actions and statements by the Chinese government. Bitcoin.com reported earlier this year that monied investors in China are leaving their money in the digital currency. “We are starting to see a lot of smart money enter into the space and stay there,, ” said Ryan Rabaglia, Head Trader for Octagon Strategy, a Commodity and Digital Asset Trading firm based in Hong Kong. “In the form of small to medium sized institutions taking much larger positions in [bitcoin] and a natural progression to larger ones is sure to follow. With all the uncertainties surrounding us in traditional product spaces, alternatives are being sought, and although this space is still foreign to most, it’s not preventing the capital inflows we’re seeing.” The number of Bitcoin transactions has skyrocketed throughout the digital currency’s lifespan, as has the price, which currently sits near an all-time high after crossing the $1,000 threshold twice so far in 2017. The number of bitcoin wallets at popular multi-service provider Blockchain.info has increased, as well, in the past eight years. Trading volumes are also at all-time highs. Yet, over time, Bitcoin price volatility has declined. "
2017-02-06T15:00:22-04:00,Mainstream Investors Are Hearing A lot About Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/last-week-investors-heard-bitcoin/,"Investors worldwide are hearing about Bitcoin on a regular basis these past few months. These days, it’s not uncommon for mainstream media, investment moguls, and organizations to shine a light on bitcoin’s excellent performance over 2016 and into the new year. With many individuals and companies discussing the cryptocurrency’s merits, investors worldwide are unknowingly getting an earful of Bitcoin. Also read: Venezuelan Bitcoin Miners Arrested for ‘Electricity Theft’ This week, on Bloomberg Markets with Rishaad Salamat, the show sits down with Michael Dunworth, CEO, and co-founder of Wyre to discuss bitcoin demand. Dunworth explains that bitcoin may be worth more than gold soon and discusses some investors’ issues with the digital asset’s volatility. Host Rishaad Salamat asks Dunworth why the young entrepreneur believes bitcoin will be worth more than the shiny precious metal. “If you look at the principles of bitcoin, it’s actually already met parity with Gold in 2013 for one bitcoin per ounce of gold,” explains Michael Dunworth of Wyre. “But moving forward, bitcoin has what gold wishes it had. It has divisibility, still has scarcity like gold, but it’s also extremely transferable. If I wanted to get a brick of gold to you over there, Rishaad, it’s going to be pretty tough. If I wanted to send you some bitcoin with the same level of store of value, I can do that pretty quickly. So I think it’s a new age for storing value.” Following the Bloomberg Markets report investors then heard from the Wall Street publication Market Watch this week. According to the investment publication, investors are waiting patiently for the upcoming Bitcoin ETF decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Furthermore, some investors believe that Donald Trump as POTUS may pave the way for a cryptocurrency-based ETF. However, even though Trump may ease regulatory policies across the country, it still may not happen. “Trump will ease the way, but that doesn’t mean it’s suddenly a sure thing,” details Phil Bak, former head of ETF listings at the New York Stock Exchange. Bak told Market Watch that regulators have a hard time dealing with innovation, stating:   Another broadcast which gave investors a glimpse at Bitcoin this week was an interview with Blockchain CEO, Peter Smith at the World Economic Forum in Davos. On the “Davos Today” program, Smith tells the host that people are reexamining their relationship with the world and Bitcoin is a part of a shift. The shift has “created an opportunity for new technology,” explains the Blockchain founder. When asked if bitcoin could ever become legal tender, Smith believes most of the framework has already been established. “Most of the G7 has figured out how they’re going to tax bitcoin, as a commodity and as an asset,” details Blockchain CEO, Peter Smith. “I think it’s already a legal tender. There are millions of people using it on a weekly basis, but what I think what it is, it’s the first example of a truly digital asset. So what I think will happen over the next five years is we will see the creation of a lot of new digital assets. Some of these will be issued by governments themselves, others will be specific to companies, specific to loyalty programs, and specific to products like identity or governance. But I think it’s the first initial step in rewriting how a lot of this stuff works.” As bitcoin breaks its latest price barrier into the US$955 range, it’s safe to say investors heard about Bitcoin from all angles this past week.

2017-02-05T19:00:31-04:00,Surbitcoin On Hiatus Amid Venezuela Bitcoin Crackdown,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/surbitcoin-shut-down-bitcoin-crackdown/,"On February 3 the Venezuelan Bitcoin exchange Surbitcoin informed its customers services would be suspended temporarily. According to the exchange, Surbitcoin’s banking partner, Banesco, closed the firm’s account. The news comes shortly after the recent crackdown on Venezuelan Bitcoin mining activities in the region. Also read: SEC Begins Soliciting Comments On Bitcoin Investment Trust A lot of people were hoping the struggling citizens of Venezuela could use Bitcoin to escape the country’s economic crisis. For a short period, this seemed to be the case as headlines reported underground mining operations, stories of residents using Bitcoin for remittances, and the country’s Localbitcoins’ volumes exploding. Furthermore, Venezuelan interest in the digital currency could also be seen rising on Google search engines as queries grew significantly over the past few months. However, over the past couple of weeks, the socialist government has seemed to take issue with certain Bitcoin-related activities. At the end of January, law enforcement within the region cracked down on Bitcoin mining operations, citing “electricity theft” in both instances. One of the largest Bitcoin exchanges, Surbitcoin is having problems with its banking services as its bank suspended the company’s account. According to the exchange, the company had always faced significant obstacles with the Venezuelan bank. Surbitcoin told customers it expects “to resume operations in approximately two weeks.”  This isn’t the first time Surbitcoin had to cease operations as the exchange temporarily shut down this past July. The exchange at the time was trading at 22% below market volume and the startup explained Bolivar operations were halted due to issues with Banesco. According to a roughly translated statement from Surbitcoin at the time, Banesco bank suspected an individual was committing fraud. The exchange’s account was abruptly shut down, but no specific reasons were detailed. “Dear customer, yesterday we received a communication from the management of Banesco where we are informed that our bank account will be closed,” stated SurBitcoin. The Venezuelan exchange has told its customers they should immediately withdraw their Bolivars. Furthermore, Surbitcoin has told its clientele for the time being they should use the peer-to-peer marketplace Localbitcoins until business resumes. Localbitcoins’ volumes in the country have continued to remain very high during January. For now, accessibility to Bitcoin seems to be getting harder and speculation of government intervention run rampant in Venezuela. According to the founder and CEO of Surbitcoin, Rodrigo Souza, the temporary closure of the company may have something to do with the eight Bitcoin miners arrested over the past two weeks. “When it was found that there were 11,000 mining computers consuming the energy to power a whole town at a time when there are severe electricity shortages, it triggered a reaction,” Souza explained. “We were not contacted by the government, but our bank is revoking our account because it doesn’t want to be involved. We are currently reaching out to other banking partners.” What do you think about the recent events concerning cryptocurrency in Venezuela? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-02-05T12:00:43-04:00,New Bitcoin Caching Features Could Improve Block Verification,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/new-bitcoin-cachin-features-could-improve-block-verification/,"A new way of verifying blocks on the Bitcoin blockchain could make the digital currency more efficient. In the original version of Bitcoin, when nodes received a block of transactions, they would validate each transaction set. Most likely, these transactions were already validated before, when they were relayed across the network.  However, this previous validation of the transaction was not used in block validation, causing an inefficiency in Bitcoin that limited the speed of block propagation. There have been many developer attempts to make this more efficient, including the forthcoming ‘Cuckoo Cache’. Also Read: A Collection of Interesting and Recent Bitcoin Charts In May 2012, Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen added code to Bitcoin that caches results of signature verifications. “A node would check the cache to see if it was a properly validated signature”, explains Bitcoin coder Jeremy Rubin, who encourages developers of all levels to contact him (here’s his Twitter). “This would save nodes from the need to do an expensive ECDSA signature validation that they’ve already done before”. While examining Bitcoin’s codebase, Mr. Rubin noticed inefficiencies in how Bitcoin blocks were processed, rooted in the design of this Signature Cache. He began looking at the design with the idea of easing this tension in mind. “Imagine if every time you needed something, you had to go all the way home”, Mr. Rubin uses an analogy to describe Bitcoin’s original verification process. “It would be really tough to get through the day, especially around lunch time. But that’s why we carry backpacks. We can pack our lunch, pencils, books, and take them with us if we know we’ll need them later. We still have to go home sometimes if we need something we didn’t expect, but this happens infrequently”. In programming, a ‘cache’ is a little bit like a backpack. “Bitcoin’s original signature cache was like trying to use a plastic bag with a tiny opening, half full of rocks, with holes in it as a backpack”, explicates Mr. Rubin, who worked on the code while contracting with Chaincode. “Due to the rocks, it was very heavy. Because of the holes, things would fall out all the time. Because it was a plastic bag, everything was disorganized and it took a while for you to find what you were looking for. Because of the tiny opening, you could only fit one hand in at a time and you can’t see what’s in your bag while you’re getting something or putting something in. But at the end of the day, having this bag is a lot better than having to go home so frequently”. Cuckoo Cache, as Mr. Rubin analogizes, is like a backpack which has pockets and organizers, helping Bitcoin’s code knows where to look right away for the things it needs to verify transaction blocks.  “The openings are large enough and you can see what’s there while you’re taking something out”, says the twentysomething, who once had to fend off a sweeping subpoena for Bitcoin coding activities. “It’s not filled with heavy rocks for no reason. You forget something at home on occasion, and you still lose something every now and again, but not as frequently as when using the bag with the holes”. Mr. Rubin believes fine-tuning Bitcoin’s code via upgrades like Cuckoo Cache, which is integrated in the forthcoming Bitcoin Core Version 0.14, can go a long way towards improving network efficiencies. He suggests, moreover, that improved caching structures could improve other facets of Bitcoin’s codebase. “With Bitcoin, there are a lot of places in the codebase where we’ve used standard C++ data structures, because the standard library provides the simplest way to prototype many things, and these are capable of carrying the workload at first”, Mr. Rubin explained to Bitcoin.com. “But as Bitcoin scales, there are many big wins to be had if we reconsider the way we store and process Bitcoin’s data”. Optimizing these data structures, according to Mr. Rubin, is a particularly good place to get started with Bitcoin core development. “Data Structure optimization is a great place to start contributing to Bitcoin because the problems are pretty self-contained. You don’t need to understand all of Bitcoin to get started, and it’s somewhat easy to measure and communicate your results. Through working on these problems, however, you begin to gain a deep understanding of how Bitcoin works at a low level”. Mr. Rubin encouraged developers interested to find such a project, but looking for guidance on how to get started or feedback on their work, to reach out to him via email.

2017-02-05T06:00:56-04:00,How to Defend Against Keyloggers That Are after Your Bitcoins,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/defend-keyloggers-bitcoins/,"Malware that records your keystrokes and sends them back to the attacker, referred to as a keylogger, is a significant threat to your stash of bitcoins. These nearly undetectable programs could be running on your computer or smartphone right now, copying every password, seed, and pin number you type. When they send back that data to the attacker, it may be all too easy for them to gain full access to your bitcoin wallets.  Also read: How to Protect Yourself From Ransomware  Bitcoin.com talked with Magni Sigurdsson, threat researcher at Cyren, to learn more about how to protect bitcoin wallets from this threat. Cyren is a cloud-based, Internet security technology company providing threat detection and security analytics to software and hardware vendors, service providers and value-added resellers (VARs). Its solutions are “relied upon by many of the world’s largest technology companies such as Dell, Google, McAfee and Microsoft”, according to the company’s website. Its cloud security platform processes over 17 billion daily transactions. The company protects over 600 million users. Bitcoin.com (BC): How often are computers infected with keylogger malware that can steal bitcoin wallets? Cyren (C): Malware that steals cryptocurrency wallets has been around since 2012. In 2013 there was a massive spike in this type of malware and it’s hard to say how many infections there have been, but: They are all after the same thing – the wallet, crypto addresses (Bitcoin address) and the password that protects the wallet. But the difference is how they do it and on what platform. BC: How many different ways are there to get infected? C: There are several ways to get infected. The most common one would be from an email with attachment. The attachment can be in many different forms, for example an office document, pdf, JavaScript, or just an executable. Usually the email is a fake invoice from banks or delivery companies or something similar. We then have the classic USB stick delivery method where the malware author drops USB sticks with the malware across the city or near an office building that he is targeting. When a victim picks it up to check what’s on the drive he gets infected by an auto run script on the USB stick. Drive-by-downloads are also popular where the victim may accidentally visit a malicious web page that automatically downloads the malware. Malicious links or attachments via social media are also very popular these days. BC: Is the mobile operating system safer than a desktop PC?
 C: The mobile operating system should be safer if the user sticks to the Google play store/iOS app store and is not installing apps from unknown sources. There was a malware on android that exploited a bug in the android system to steal information from bitcoin wallets in 2013, but that has been fixed since then. Android and iOS are pretty strict on the keylogging so it’s easier to exploit the desktop PC. BC: How can we check if we are being keylogged? C: For Windows users: Check which processes are running, using, for example, Task Manager, and look for something out of the ordinary. Examining the outgoing network traffic from the PC is also effective. Look for strange outgoing connections. BC: How do we prevent being infected with keylogger malware? C: Obviously do not open strange attachments or click links from emails that you are unsure about. Always check who’s the sender by checking the email address, and if you are not expecting this document or attachment to be sent to you, then make sure you have someone with the proper knowledge to check it before exploring it further. Evidently, relying on users to police their email is a strategy which will have at best limited success. Moreover, there can be quite a bit of latency from the time an endpoint anti-virus provider detects something to the time any black list is updated. So relying on user behavior and local anti-virus software is problematic. A better strategy is to use a first-rate secure email gateway which will detect and block delivery of the attachment in the first place. Also use a secure web gateway for internet traffic which inspects outbound connections, preventing the transmission of the data captured, even if infection happens. Make sure to install the latest operating system updates. BC: What is the best way to get rid of keylogger malware? C: First of all, scan the computer with an Anti-virus program that is up to date and see if it is able to remove the keylogger. Open the task manager or activity monitor, depending on the operating system, and make sure every process that is running is safe and not malicious. If you find a process that is a keylogger, then make sure you remove it from the folder it starts up in, the registry, and any other places that it might be in. Search for the process name on the internet and if it’s a common one you will be able to find instructions on how to remove is. After removing the keylogger it is good to reboot the system and monitor the process to see that it is not starting up and that it has been completely removed from the system.

2017-02-04T19:00:30-04:00,Bitcoin-Friendly Denmark to Appoint First Digital Ambassador,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-friendly-denmark-appoint-first-digital-ambassador/,"Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and other technology giants have reached such importance and power that “they merit their own ambassador,” says Danish Foreign Minister Anders Samuelsen, Politiken reported. Concurrently, Denmark continues its efforts towards becoming a cashless society. Also read: These are the World’s Top 10 Bitcoin-Friendly Countries Building a cashless society and attracting investments from technology companies are Denmark’s primary objectives. In this connection, Denmark might become the first country to appoint a special ambassador to represent Denmark’s interests to the world’s largest technology companies. According to Politiken, the “digital ambassador” would deal with multinational technology giants like Google, Apple, and Microsoft. These corporations are now so large in terms of economic strength and influence that they surpass many of the countries where Denmark has traditional ambassadors. “These companies have become a kind of new nation, and we have to deal with,” points out Samuelsen. For Denmark, being Bitcoin and technology friendly is proving to be beneficial. Denmark’s general good attitude toward technology is already giving dividends. For example, Denmark is attracting significant investments from powerful corporations. Facebook plans to establish a massive data center in the third-largest city Odense.  “The decision follows Apple’s billion DKK investment in a data center in Viborg in Western Denmark in 2015 and strengthens Denmark’s position as an attractive location for global data centers,” according to a publication from the Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs. “Facebook’s choice of Denmark is largely due to our effective and attractive business environment. Denmark has earned top international rankings – most recently as number six in Forbes’ 2016 “Best Country for Business,” says Minister for Industry, Business and Financial Affairs, Brian Mikkelsen. “Now we should put our efforts into matching our business development to a still more digital future. Data centers are part of the way forward.” Denmark is recognized as an innovation leader in many areas, such as biotech, pharmaceutical sciences, IT, telecommunications, and design. The country is also considered a frontrunner in financial technology. In this regard, Denmark is one of the top Bitcoin-friendly countries. It was one of the first countries to declare that Bitcoin trades were tax-free. Moreover, in March 2014, the Central Bank of the Kingdom of Denmark announced that the cryptocurrency was not money. Anders Samuelsen is familiar to Bitcoin. His political party, the Liberal Alliance, accepts donations in bitcoins. Additionally, in 2014, the Liberal Alliance was the first party to use Bitcoin’s blockchain technology in an internal election. Denmark is leading the drive to eliminate cash altogether, and experts believe it might become be the first cashless society country. Moreover, the Danish Central Bank is considering using blockchain to create a digital currency, E-Krone, to reduce transaction costs, especially on micropayments. Denmark’s neighbors, Norway, Finland, and Sweden, are also heading towards a cashless society. Social media and Internet companies’ power is becoming ever more pervasive, even in the realm of financial services. Logically, tech companies have the expertise and means to make a substantial contribution to helping build a cashless society. Denmark’s digital ambassador will certainly have to deal with technology corporations attracted to the country’s efforts to improve its business environment while advancing towards a cashless society. In addition, the digital ambassador will need to bear in mind the virtues that Bitcoin offers to create an efficient, cheap, fast, secure, and frictionless payment system.

2017-02-04T12:00:23-04:00,Bitcoin Community Rallies Around Bitcoiner Attacked at UC Berkeley,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoiner-attacked-uc-berkeley/,"A young woman wearing a red “Make Bitcoin Great Again” hat, in the style of popular Trump campaign apparel, was maced in front of television cameras as violent protesters destroyed parts of downtown Berkeley Wednesday night. The events unfolded after a speaking engagement by Breitbart editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who has penned pro-Bitcoin pieces, was cancelled.  Also Read: How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost Kiara Robles, who regularly contributes to Github on Bitcoin matters, sported a red “Make Bitcoin Great Again” hat a la the President’s popular hat. A graphic scene unfolded before television cameras as Ms. Robles was pepper-sprayed by an unknown person wearing black gloves. In a video gone viral among the Bitcoin community, a hand can be seen reaching towards Ms. Robles from behind the cameras before she is sprayed in the face.    “I’m looking to make a statement by just being here and I think the protesters are doing the same”, Ms. Robles, who identifies as gay, was saying. “Props to the ones who are doing it non-violently, but I think that’s a very rare thing indeed”. For her, the violence was about to hit close to home.  After ABC 7 published the video showing the attack, the Bitcoin community took to the internet to speak out against the violence and support one of their ilk. The China-based BTCC, one of the largest Bitcoin companies in the world and producer of the hat, condemned the attack and violence on Twitter. “Our hearts go out to @kiarafrobles who was attacked @UCBerkeley yesterday while wearing a BTCC Make Bitcoin Great Again cap”, the multi-service provider wrote. “We condemn senseless attacks based on what people are wearing or their perceived political affiliation”.  The company added: “Thank you for supporting #bitcoin @kiarafrobles; we stand with you”. On Reddit, an AMA request featured comments by Ms. Robles. She first thanked everyone for their support. The hat didn’t survive the melee. “Buuurned”, she replied to an inquiry about its condition. “Will pay in bitcoin for another”, she recounted the experience in Reddit comments. “Being pepper-sprayed is not nearly as bad as watching your friends get it too”, Ms. Robles lamented. “It was the worst.. to feel totally helpless. There is no way to even remotely defend yourself after that, but I guess that’s the point”. Various groups diverged on the Berkeley campus as “polytechnics, smoke, strife, and anger” manifested. Groups defined Mr. Yiannopoulos’ rhetoric as hate speech, some of whom shot fireworks at the building where he was set to speak, while others defended the gay Brit’s right to free speech.  According to the local ABC affiliate, there were approximately 400 active protesters and some 300 people looking on. As the night continued, protesters took to the streets of Berkeley carrying signs as some threw rocks at buildings. Banks such as Chase, Wells Fargo and Bank of America were reportedly vandalized, with broken glass scattered across the concrete. “Kill Trump” could be seen spray-painted on buildings. https://twitter.com/kiarafrobles/status/827029548206133248 In a news conference, officials condemned the violence. U.C. Berkeley police and university officials warned students not to exit dorms and ordered individuals to shelter-in-place. “In a free country with free speech in iconic Berkeley, no matter what a person’s politics, we were all witness to violence”, Wayne Freedman wrote for ABC 7. Based on her Reddit comments, it’s likely that Ms. Robles will hold an AMA on Reddit soon.

Also read: Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF ‘Very Low’  On January 20, Barry Silbert filed a registration statement with the SEC to list his flagship investment product, the BIT, on the NYSE Arca exchange. The following week, the exchange promptly filed with the Commission proposing “to list and trade shares” of the BIT. Then, on Friday, the SEC published a notice “to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons”. The notice reads: Comments may be submitted either online, by email, or on paper. File Number SR-NYSEArca-2017-06 must be referenced. All comments will be posted on the SEC website. This is the second Bitcoin trust that seeks to list on the NYSE Arca. The first was SolidX Bitcoin Trust. According to the SEC, only seven comments were received for SolidX. The proposed rule change has not yet been published in the Federal Register, which is the next step of the process. The SEC took two weeks to start soliciting comments for both SolidX and the BIT after their initial filings. For SolidX, the Commission started soliciting comments on July 27, 2016, and published the proposed rule change less than a week later in the Federal Register on August 2, 2016. If SolidX is any indication, then the BIT’s proposed rule change should be published in the Federal Register sometime next week. According to the Commission, once published in the Federal Register, it will have 45 days from the date of publication, or up to 90 days if it finds a reason for the extension. By that time, the Commission will make a decision to either approve or disapprove the proposed rule change, or it will “institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be disapproved,” the SEC wrote about both the BIT and SolidX. Regardless of the 45 or 90-day initial time frame, the Commission has extended the consideration period repeatedly for SolidX. Finally, on January 3 this year, the Commission announced that it “finds it appropriate to designate a longer period within which to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change so that it has sufficient time to consider this proposed rule change.” It then designated March 30, 2017, as the date by which the proposed rule change for SolidX should either be approved or disapproved, which is 240 days from the date of the publication in the Federal Register. As with SolidX, the Commission could take 240 days from the Federal Register publication date to decide on the BIT’s listing, which would likely be in early October. However, experts are predicting little chance of any Bitcoin trusts being approved by the SEC. Needham & Company, for example, said that the chance is less than 25 percent.

The first thing a merchant should do when planning on accepting bitcoin at their online store is figure out how they’d like to process the cryptocurrency. Store owners should get a Bitcoin wallet and first figure out the logistics of transacting with the currency. If the ecommerce website doesn’t have an integrated shopping cart system and sales are processed manually, store owners can accept Bitcoin right away. All a merchant has to do is use their wallet address to accept the currency and place a “Bitcoin Accepted Here” banner on the website. A merchant can then put a QR code on the website for customers to scan and start accepting Bitcoin instantly. This is probably the simplest way a merchant can accept Bitcoin without integrating a payment gateway. There are a lot of resources available that help an ecommerce site accept bitcoin using a payment gateway. This includes services that help merchants integrate shopping cart plug-ins and website payment buttons. There are many companies worldwide dedicated to getting merchants set up with Bitcoin acceptance and can also provide invoices, and exchange the cryptocurrency for your local tender. Bitcoin.com has an excellent merchant solutions portal that can help guide you along the way. Our site offers our own “Pay with Bitcoin” buttons and a huge list of merchant service providers. Businesses that provide payment gateways and merchant services include Shopify, Bitpay, Bitkassa, Bitpagos, Cashila, Spectrocoin, Paxful, Airbitz, Mycelium Gear, and many more. Some of these companies offer immediate fiat exchange, invoices and billing, accounting, and global support. Merchants who are crypto-novices may find more comfort dealing with a company that handles payment gateways and accounting services. Companies focused on merchant services make the process less complex, and time-consuming. The bottom line is accepting bitcoin gets your online store noticed and captures an emerging market. Credit card processors charge significantly higher fees with the money going towards the world of traditional corporatism. Bitcoin fees are significantly lower, and this can allow merchants to pass the savings onto the customer. With a small fee, bitcoin transactions can be transferred all across the globe. A broad array of choices are available for a merchant deciding to accept the cryptocurrency online, including many brick n’ mortar store options as well. Merchants can decide to accept Bitcoin on their own and acquire the cryptocurrency as a store of value. But if Bitcoin’s price volatility scares them, then using a service like Bitpay’s retail ecommerce solution means processing the cryptocurrency promptly and paying a bank account directly in the local fiat currency. Accepting bitcoin is pretty easy and there are many different ways to accomplish the task. So what are you waiting for? Open your ecommerce site to a whole new global market today!

2017-02-03T12:00:04-04:00,The Bitcoin Exchange Thefts You May Have Forgotten,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-exchange-thefts-forgotten/,"Cryptocurrency exchange losses have been a nuisance since Bitcoin was first created. Many remember the loss of roughly 850,000 BTC in the demise of Mt Gox and the most recent 120,000 BTC Bitfinex compromise. However, over the course of the past eight years there has been various exchange hacks and/or inside jobs. Also read: Review of the Cold Storage Hardware Wallet Cryptosteel Since 2009 there have been roughly over fifty hacking thefts against notable businesses associated with the Bitcoin industry. Millions of dollars worth of bitcoins have been stolen, lost, and compromised over the years. Each case has been mysterious, and many of these hacks remain unsolved. Today we discuss some of the exchange hacks and losses that may have been forgotten. Bitcoin7 was a business operating in 2011 that was once the third-largest BTC/USD exchange behind Tradehill and Mt Gox. On October 5, 2011, the company reported a theft of 5,000 BTC allegedly stemming from a group of Russian hackers. However, many believe the breach was an inside job and employees ran off with the funds. The Bitcoin7 domain was later sold for $10,000 USD in 2013, but has been offline ever since this incident. In the Spring of 2012, the cloud-hosting business located in New Jersey, Linode, was compromised by hackers. Following the breach, attackers aimed their sights on eight Bitcoin businesses, such as Tradehill, Bitcoinica, and Bitcoin.cx. An estimated total of 46,653 BTC were stolen at the time. The biggest hit was against the Bitcoinica exchange, which suffered a loss of 43,000 bitcoins. The thief involved in these particular hacks is still to this day unknown, and many suspect it was perhaps a Linode employee. Tradehill was attacked, and remained offline during this attack, but suffered no losses.    It seems Bitcoinica did not learn after the Linode scandal, and suffered two more subsequent hacks. On May 12, 2012, a hacker breached the Bitcoinica Rackspace server, according to the now-defunct exchange’s founder Zhou Tong. The exchange lost over 38,000 BTC during the spring incident. In July that same year, Bitcoinica was breached again, but this time it was a stash of BTC held on the Mt Gox exchange. 40,000 BTC were stolen. But following the heist, it was reported the funds were returned. The Bitcoinica hack is one of the most controversial within the industry as many well-known cryptocurrency community members were involved. In 2013, a 33-year-old Texan named Trendon Shavers was arrested for soliciting an estimated 200,000 BTC from 48 investors. The Bitcoin Savings and Trust was alleged to be the first securities platform based on Bitcoin as an asset class, but was really a giant Ponzi scheme. In July of 2016, Trendon Shavers was sentenced to pay restitution of $1.23 million to the 48 investors. Originally the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil lawsuit ordered Shavers to pay $40.7 million when he was first arrested in 2014. The court had recognized his efforts to make things right, though he couldn’t pay everyone back. Leading U.S. Bitcoin exchange Bitfloor was breached in September of 2012, losing over 24,000 BTC during the incident. Bitfloor explained at the time that the exchange’s hot wallet data was mistakenly held on the company’s servers which led to the hack. No bitcoins were returned to customers after the hack even though the company resumed trading and promised restitution. “As funds are available for repayment, they will be dispersed on a pro-rated basis,” explained Bitfloor’s founder and operator Roman Shtylman. However, according to the company, Bitfloor’s banks had ceased doing business with the startup and customers never saw their funds again. At one time the cryptocurrency exchange Mintpal was one of the top trading platforms. Many traders used the service to exchange bitcoins and altcoins as the exchange processed large digital currency trading volumes. In the fall of 2014 customers were told Mintpal was going to have new ownership and rebrand as “Mintpal 2.0.” The exchange was acquired by Moopay executive “Alex Green” who many believe was a shady scammer. A total of 3,894 BTC was stolen from Mintpal customers and never returned. Alex Green (also known by another alias, Ryan Kennedy) had fled the cryptocurrency scene. Green has since been arrested by the authorities, but for rape charges, as reported by Bitcoin.com. The Moopay executive was not convicted for the Mintpal theft and has yet to claim responsibility. Hacks have occurred quite a bit in the Bitcoin industry, but each attack holds the exchange or shady actors involved accountable. These problems have never been attributed to the Bitcoin protocol except by ignorant mainstream media skeptics. Breaches and compromises such as these have since diminished since the early days and hacks are far and few between. The most recent hacks over the past year or so have been Shapeshift, Cryptsy, and Bitfinex. Both Shapeshift, and Bitfinex have managed to stay operational and rectify losses. Cryptsy founder Paul Vernon is nowhere to be found, though lawsuits abound. Things have definitely gotten better over the years, and community members are constantly reminding people not to hold cryptocurrency reserves on exchanges. As the saying goes, if you don’t hold your private keys, you don’t own Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency community sometimes forgets some of the hacked exchanges of the past, but remembering these incidents better prepares us for securing the future of this technology.

An EY team was also present to assist visitors with purchasing and spending bitcoin. Also read: EY Switzerland Accepts Bitcoin and Installs ATM  The recent World Web Conference was a two-day leadership event with over 1,400 delegates from global corporations. The series of talks covered a rounded set of topics like energy building, communication, legal, and lifestyle, but had a focus on Fintech.  At the conference, EY Switzerland announced: EY has a wallet app which the firm provided to its employees for them to pay for products and services using bitcoin. Once the bitcoin is withdrawn, users have the option of donating it to a foundation which EY supports called Avatar Kids. “An EY team is present to assist on the bitcoin purchase and spend process”, the firm said. Dr. Karin Kirchner, Head of Communications and Media Relations at EY Switzerland, told Bitcoin.com: She added that the main respondents seemed to be coming from companies already associated in some form with either blockchain or bitcoin. “These companies were interested in EY’s association with the currency”, she revealed. In addition, “there was a particular interest in the Bitcoin wallet which EY made available to its employees. The adoption of the professional services firm to bitcoin-based products and services attracted a lot of attention”, she noted. Out of the Big Four accounting firms, EY has been the most pro-Bitcoin lately. The company announced in November that its office in Switzerland started accepting bitcoin for payment of its services. In addition, EY Switzerland installed a BTM in the lobby of its main building, accessible to the public in Zurich. “This ATM can be used by EY employees as well as passers-by to exchange Swiss francs for bitcoins and vice versa,” the firm noted at the time. The BTM is part of an internal EY Switzerland digitalization program and “is intended to make employees more familiar with the topics of blockchains and cryptocurrencies”. The daily amount of bitcoin that can be topped up to a smartphone is limited to CHF 5,000. Bitaccess is the manufacturer of this BTM and the operator is Bity, a Swiss bitcoin broker based in Neuchâtel, which is roughly 76 miles from the Canton of Zug where many bitcoin service companies are located. The fee for using this BTM is 3.0 percent for buying and 0.8 percent for selling which is actually the lowest of all the BTMs found nearby according to Coinatmradar. In comparison, the average fee out of all 956 BTMs listed on the BTM tracking site is 8.52 percent for buying and 5.84 percent for selling. Just a couple of months before EY installed its first BTM, another Big Four accounting firm, Deloitte, installed one in the lobby of its Toronto office. That machine charges 1 percent for both buying and selling of bitcoin, according to Coinatmradar. It is operated by Rubix and is also a Bitaccess machine. The daily transaction limit is $100 per person. Meanwhile, the other two ‘Big Four’ firms, Pricewaterhousecoopers (PwC) and KPMG have each published some research on Bitcoin but have yet to install their own BTMs. What do you think of EY’s strategy to raise awareness using BTMs?

2017-02-02T19:00:40-04:00,Industry Thinks President Trump Will Be “Bitcoin Friendly” Ahead of Cybersecurity Order,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-trump-cybersecurity/,"According to an attendee of private Bitcoin conclave Satoshi Roundtable III, both a congresswoman and CEO of Overstock Patrick Byrne believe President Trump, mired in a web of controversy in the US and globally, will be “bitcoin friendly” — even as a sweeping draft executive order on the nation’s cybersecurity framework awaits his signature.  Also Read: Exclusive Satoshi Roundtable Commences  According to OpenBazaar founder Brian Hoffman, the special guest for day one of the Cancun retreat called the Satoshi Roundtable was a congresswoman who gave the gathering a “rundown of what to expect” from the Trump Administration regarding Bitcoin and blockchain. “She had met with Trump personally and seemed very optimistic that he was going to do a good job,” he said. “Crazy like a fox, not crazy is how she characterized him.” Mr. Hoffman also recounted Overstock and T0 founder Patrick Byrne’s thoughts on the new president. “He reinforced the opinion of the Congressman that Trump’s cabinet seemed to be somewhat Bitcoin-friendly, but differed in that he thought Trump was probably crazy and not like a fox.” February 1 the CEO appeared on Fox Business channel wearing a red “Make Bitcoin Great Again” a la Trump campaign apparel.  The comments leaked from the private Satoshi Roundtable just days before the President delayed the signing of a cybersecurity executive order. (EO) A draft of the EO outlines a mandate for the “national security system”, defined as “any telecommunications or information system operated by Federal Government or any contractor on its behalf including those working on “cryptologic activities related to national security.” The draft calls for a “review of the principal US cyber adversaries” and has implications for the National Security Agency, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Defense. Moreover, the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of the DHS would be instructed to gather and review information from the Department of Education as to what students are learning about cybersecurity in school, implying a degree of coordination between military, federal law enforcement, and schools. The draft executive order reads: “The cyber realm is undergoing constant, rapid change as a result of the pace of technological innovation, the explosive global growth in Internet use, the increasing interdependencies between the networks and the operations of infrastructure and key economic institutions. As a result of these changes, cyberspace has emerged as a new domain of engagement, comparable in significance to land, sea, air and space, and its significance will increase in the years ahead.”  The Bitcoin world was enthused when President-elect Trump picked Bitcoin-believer Peter Thiel to head his transition team on matters of science and technology. Mr. Thiel, recently ousted as a New Zealand citizen based on his “exceptional circumstances”, then tapped Bitcoin company 21 Inc founder Balaji Srinivasan as a candidate to lead a potential reorganization of the Food and Drug Administration. Upon being considered for the position, Mr. Srinivasan promptly deleted his Twitter history. Instead of signing the cybersecurity mandate Tuesday, as expected, the President met with NSA director Admiral Mike Roger, senior adviser Jared Kushner, chief strategist Steve Bannon and “other national security officials” to discuss the issues at hand. CNN interpreted the executive order on cybersecurity as a move to “consolidate responsibility for protecting the government from hackers,” though, as is the order of the day, Mr. Trump said he would put the head of federal agencies and departments responsible for any hacks that transpire under their watch. Interestingly, the draft executive order fails to mention the role of the FBI, which has publicly played a role in numerous Bitcoin-related investigations, nor the CIA in the nation’s cybersecurity framework.

2017-02-02T12:00:59-04:00,Satoshipay is Taking Bitcoin Nanopayments to the Mainstream,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/satoshipay-bitcoin-nanopayments-mainstream/,"Bitcoin startup Satoshipay has been enabling content publishers to facilitate tiny bitcoin payments with no fees for almost a year now. The company has just raised €1 million to take their ‘nanopayments’ to the mainstream. Also read: Cryptoseed Adds Security to Your Bitcoin Recovery Seed  Headquartered in London with an office in Berlin, Satoshipay started developing its nanopayment product in April 2015. Its beta version was released the following February. While micropayments are usually €10 or less, nanopayments “are a thousand times smaller” such as a few cents or less, according to the company. Last year, through organic growth alone, almost 30,000 user wallets were created and over 300 publishers signed up for its service worldwide, according to founder Meinhard Benn. The company partnered with Visa Europe Collab in May on paid videos and downloads such as PDFs, office software documents, and e-books. This week the company finished their seed round funding of €1 million with the aim “to bring nanopayments to the mainstream”, Benn announced. Investors include Blue Star Capital, Jim Mellon, Huiyin Blockchain Venture, and Kryptonite. The company will now focus on bringing its services to the masses by adding more payment methods such as credit cards and other instant payments for topping up credit. Benn noted: Satoshipay is a Bitcoin layer-two service allowing bitcoiners to send sub-penny payments, without any fees, to website owners. Visitors on a Satoshipay-enabled site will see a small circle called the ‘Sun of Satoshi’ pop up in their browser window. The number displayed inside the circle represents the amount available inside their Satoshipay wallet. In this example, 402,000 satoshis are left. Payments are only available for sites that run the plugin. To add money to the wallet, click on it and various top-up options will appear such as direct bitcoin transfer and a Coinbase payment transfer, which is quicker since no confirmation is needed. For website publishers, a WordPress plugin can be installed for free for webmasters to charge money for any content on their websites. They can charge per post, per small snippet of text, or even enable ad blocker detection which will then ask users for a small payment. Publishers need to create a Satoshipay account after installing the plugin which gives access to statistics on traffic and earnings on their dashboard. There is no waiting for approval and content can be added immediately. Besides the typical Bitcoin network fee, there are no fees for either the publishers nor the readers for now. As Satoshipay’s popularity grows, the team plans to charge 10% for all
publisher payouts. Satoshipay’s API, launched last May, extends the service’s toolset beyond paywalls. It provides tools for developers to use Satoshipay for a wide array of online nanopayments such as for selling eBooks, music, movies, and most formats of digital content. In order to use the API, webmasters need to: In his recent announcement, Benn detailed additional features, stating that: What do you think of Satoshipay? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-02-02T10:00:28-04:00,UAE Did Not Ban Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/uae-not-ban-bitcoin/,"The Central Bank in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) issued the ‘Regulatory Framework for Stored Values and Electronic Payment Systems’ on January 1 which appeared to ban all virtual currencies. However, the Bank’s Governor recently corrected this misconception, confirming that virtual currencies, including bitcoin, are not banned. Also read: Dubai’s Role With Blockchain Technology’s Success Story  The UAE Central Bank defines ‘virtual currency’ as “any type of digital unit used as a medium of exchange, a unit of account, or a form of stored value”. The recent Regulatory Framework states that virtual currencies are not recognized by these regulations, adding that: This statement caused many people to conclude that the Central Bank has banned all virtual currencies. However, Gulf News recently obtained clarification from the Central Bank confirming that virtual currencies were not banned. Mubarak Rashid Khamis Al Mansouri, Governor of the Central Bank, told the publication: The Governor also revealed that virtual currencies are “under review by the Central Bank and new regulations will be issued as appropriate.” He emphasized that the Regulation Framework’s core objective is “to facilitate robust adoption of digital payments across the UAE”. The Regulatory Framework is still unclear on what exactly is included. “Looking at the relevant wording and its location in the new Regulations (section D – Common Regulatory Requirements for all PSPs)”, Brian Meenagh, Partner at the Dubai-based Latham & Watkins law firm, explained to Bitcoin.com that “it appears that the intent of the wording is to prohibit payment service providers licensed under the new Regulations from dealing in virtual currencies at this point in time rather than prohibit virtual currencies throughout the UAE”. These regulations would probably “give some comfort to businesses that treat bitcoin as a commodity that people can trade” such as exchanges, Meenagh said. However, “businesses that treat bitcoin as a currency that can be used for retail transactions or currency remittances should still proceed cautiously and seek further guidance as to whether or not they are affected (or prohibited) by the Regulations”, he added, citing the new regulations’ definition of payment service provider. While some countries, such as Japan, consider Bitcoin as a method of payment, others, like the U.S., consider Bitcoin an asset. For the UAE, Meenagh believes that “until further guidance is issued, the new Regulations may lead to a pause in efforts to promote Bitcoin as a method of payment”. However, based on the Governor’s clarifications, “we would not expect the Regulations to change any behavior with respect to the operation and use of bitcoin exchanges in the UAE”, he clarified. Nonetheless, virtual currencies are “being considered” by both the UAE Central Bank and the Dubai Supreme Legislation Committee, Meenagh pointed out. Last November, the Dubai Supreme Legislation Committee hosted a workshop on ‘the present and future of legislative and legal frameworks of Bitcoin’. Held amid a “high-level attendance of local and federal government entities,” the purpose of the talk was to help bring the UAE up to speed on the challenges that bitcoin and other digital currencies present. “The term ‘virtual currency’ is relatively new, not only in the UAE and the region but also globally. Therefore, there is an urgent need to spread awareness about ‘Bitcoin’”, said H.E. Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi, Secretary General of The Supreme Legislation Committee in the Emirate of Dubai. H.E.

2017-02-02T06:00:22-04:00,Considering Bitcoin An Asset Could Set Back Adoption in Israel,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/considering-bitcoin-asset-set-back-adoption-israel/,"The Israeli Tax Authority (ITA) recently published a draft clarifying its stance on digital currencies including bitcoin for the first time. Bitcoin.com examines the legality of the draft and its effects on the Israeli Bitcoin community. Also read: Why South Korean Bitcoin Adoption Could Outpace Most Other Countries This Year  The draft published by the ITA earlier this month states that digital currencies should be considered an ‘asset’ and not a currency. Their sale will therefore be taxed as a sale of property and income from the sale subject to capital gains tax. However, if the nature of the digital currency transaction is a business one and not a capital one, the difference in the exchange rate will be subject to tax as business income instead of capital gains. The Draft also subjects digital currencies to Value Added Tax (VAT) just like the sale of other goods. Currently, Israel has no legislation on digital currencies and “the draft will merely be 
commentaries”, according to Adv. Harel Perlmutter, Head of the Tax Department at Barnea & Co., whose office is located in Tel Aviv. “The draft circular is a declaration of intent” from the ITA and “at this stage there is no draft legislation published”, he told Bitcoin.com. “The next stage will be the final tax circular which is a commentary on the tax law by the ITA”, he explained, adding that: The Israeli Bitcoin community has been waiting for the ITA to clarify its stance on the digital currency for quite some time. However, this draft is not quite what some were expecting. “Our perception of this draft is very negative”, Youval Rouach, CEO of Bits of Gold, a Tel Aviv-based bitcoin exchange and merchant service provider told Bitcoin.com. Citing this draft is the first time the government is trying to regulate bitcoin, he said: His company helps clients in Europe and Israel buy and sell bitcoin in both U.S. dollars and Israeli shekels as well as offers merchant solutions for accepting bitcoin. “We’ve been cooperating with the Regulator for quite some time now, and have held a state-issued certificate of ‘Currency Service Provider’ since 2013”, Rouach revealed. However, this new draft means the company would have to start charging VAT for the whole amount of any bitcoin sold. For example, a client wanting to buy $1000 worth of bitcoin will have to shell out $1170, he explained, adding that this draft will incentivize Israelis to buy bitcoin outside of Israel where there is no VAT. This will likely result in “a loss of income for Israeli companies, and thus Israeli tax authorities and the public”, he claims. While not a law yet, Rouach sees the possibility that “this draft can become a mandatory paper within a month”. “If this draft becomes a reality, Bitcoin adoption in Israel will be strongly affected”, he cautioned, citing that many people will want to buy bitcoin outside of Israel or in black markets instead of using proper, licensed channels. In addition, he believes that many people who are thinking of buying bitcoin “won’t necessarily go through the trouble of wiring money outside of Israel” so the overall number of bitcoin buyers would probably decrease. Citing the draft, he noted that “the Bitcoin and Blockchain ecosystem in Israel, one of the best start-up places in the world, is very healthy, with lots of startups here. However, we’re not sure it’ll stay like this if you reject the basics of this technology”. What do you think will happen to Bitcoin adoption once the draft becomes law in Israel?

2017-02-01T12:00:07-04:00,How Bitcoin Companies can Legally Operate in Switzerland,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-companies-legally-operate-switzerland/,"Switzerland is often thought of as a Bitcoin-friendly country. The Canton of Zug, for example, is sometimes called the crypto capital of the world and many Bitcoin service startups are located there, including Xapo, Shapeshift, Ethereum, Monetas, and Bitcoin Suisse.  Companies wanting to do business in Switzerland need an approval by the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority (FINMA). So far, no Bitcoin company has been licensed by the Authority, but being licensed is not the only way to do business in the country. Also read: Swiss Town Begins Accepting Bitcoin for Public Services  Vinzenz Mathys, a FINMA spokesperson told Bitcoin.com this week that “in the field of AML [anti-money laundering] regulation in Switzerland, service providers not subject to prudential supervision must either be affiliated to a self-regulatory organisation or be supervised directly by FINMA.” He also revealed that: FINMA has no specific provisions of digital currencies. “The use of bitcoins as a means of payment is not state-controlled”, its website states. Anyone paying in bitcoin or receiving payments in bitcoin needs no license. However, some Bitcoin-related activities are subject to Switzerland’s Anti-Money Laundering Act including buying and selling bitcoin on a commercial basis and operating trading platforms. These service providers “are obliged to find out whether they are in compliance with licensing requirements under financial market legislation”, FINMA states. To be compliant, they have two options. The first is to be licensed by FINMA to operate as a ‘directly supervised financial intermediary (DSFI)’. There are currently 194 financial intermediaries holding FINMA licenses, but none is a Bitcoin company. The alternative is to become a member of a self-regulatory organization (SRO). An SRO is an organization that has met certain criteria set out by FINMA. Its members are financial intermediaries that are not licensed by FINMA. Among other duties, SROs are responsible for ensuring that their members comply with the requirements in accordance with the Swiss Anti-Money Laundering Act and imposing penalties on any member not in compliance. Currently, FINMA recognizes 12 SROs in total, Mathys confirmed to Bitcoin.com. The largest SRO, the VQF, is the only one that is actually located in the Canton of Zug. Some Bitcoin companies are already members of the VQF SRO such as Bitcoin Suisse, BTC Express and Bity. Recently, wallet provider Xapo has received a “conditional approval” by FINMA to operate in Switzerland after almost two years of much efforts and investment, according to founder and CEO Wences Casares. “This approval is contingent on several factors, including membership in a Self-Regulatory Organization (SRO)”, Casares said. FINMA reportedly took a long time to understand Xapo’s business model in order to decide whether it should be considered a bank or a financial intermediary. If considered a bank, Xapo would have to obtain a banking license which is more complicated to qualify for. However, last week, FINMA concluded that Xapo does not need a full banking license, “because the safe-guarding of private keys wasn’t to be compared with conventional banking operations such as account keeping”, Xapo managing partner Olga Feldmeier told finews.ch. Xapo, being in the Canton of Zug, is likely to join the local VQF SRO like other Zug-based Bitcoin companies have. Regarding becoming a member of an SRO, Casares said “we are optimistic that we will meet the required conditions and be able to serve non-U.S. customers from our headquarters in Switzerland”. In addition, Casares commended FINMA for having invested considerable amount of time and resources in the approval process, adding that “many regulatory bodies in similar situations would have rejected Xapo (and Bitcoin) entirely”. Therefore, he believes that: Do you think Switzerland will become the global Bitcoin hub? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-02-01T06:00:27-04:00,How to Start Your Own Bitcoin ATM Business,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/start-bitcoin-atm-business/,"The number of Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) is growing everyday, and so are the number of people entering the industry. In order to operate a lucrative BTM business, many costs and risks need to be considered. Also read: The US Reigns Supreme in the Bitcoin ATM Industry  The revenue from a BTM depends on several factors, explains Vlad of Coinatmradar, a website that tracks BTM locations. The machine’s location is of utmost importance. A profitable BTM is often found in a conveniently accessible area with high foot traffic and general public Bitcoin interest. For machines placed in an establishment, the opening hours and type of business are also very important. Restaurants and pizzerias are the most popular locations for BTMs, Vlad noted. Based on data from 952 BTMs listed on his website worldwide by 20 manufacturers and 193 operators, Vlad said that operators reported on average a BTM brought in roughly $30,000 a month in transaction volume. On the lower end of the scale, some operators reported bringing in between $20,000 and $25,000 per machine while others reported up to $100,000 per machine. Overall, he noted that: The revenue per machine depends on the fee charged by the operator. Currently, the average BTM fee is 8.48 percent for buying bitcoin and 5.64 percent for selling, according to Coinatmradar’s calculations. There are many costs associated with running a BTM which vary based on factors such as machine type, manufacturer, country, and currency. Currently, the price of a machine ranges from $775 for a Bitteller BTM to $14,500 for a two-way Genesis Coin Genesis1 model. Vlad estimates that bitcoin ATM hardware costs, including price per machine, delivery, taxes, and installation, are usually in the range of $10,000 to $15,000. Additional costs of running a BTM business include those relating to renting a space, advertising, customer support and machine maintenance. There are also legal costs which can be substantial and could include licenses. The cost of stocking bitcoins and cash is also a big consideration since a BTM will be useless if it is out of money. He added that: In addition, a new category of expenses relating to theft and vandalism of BTMs is becoming significant. These expenses should be factored in prior to starting a BTM business as well. Below are some key steps to take when starting a BTM business. Having a business plan: A good business plan will help you formulate your business strategies and ascertain if it will be profitable as well as when breakeven will be. Check the regulations: Some jurisdictions may require ATM businesses to get a license. The cost may be ballooned and the process lengthy which could lead to unexpected costs and delay to starting the business. Establish a banking relationship: Some banks have problems doing business with Bitcoin companies. Some businesses have had their bank accounts closed because banks are ‘de-risking’ by closing customers’ accounts they feel are high risk. Establishing a good relationship with a bank is important in order to minimize the risk of the BTM’s business bank account being closed unexpectedly. Coinatmradar recommends having several banking relationships “to eliminate the potential risk of accounts closing at one bank”. Secure a good location: A BTM needs a good location to be profitable, but at the same time, BTMs can help the establishments they are located in. Store owners told Coinatmradar that a BTM can increase their sales up to 10-30 percent “because of new customers, who come to use a Bitcoin ATM.” Choose the BTM type and manufacturer: There are one-way and two-way BTMs. The latter allows customers to sell bitcoin for cash as well as buy bitcoin, but they are more expensive. Some of the most popular BTM manufacturers include Genesis Coin, Lamassu, General Bytes, and Bitaccess. Plan for customer support and maintenance: A BTM operator should strive to provide excellent customer service, and a point of contact for customer support is vital. Operators also need to constantly monitor whether each machine is operational and that bitcoins are topped up around the clock. Are you thinking of starting a BTM business?

2017-01-31T19:00:16-04:00,Bitcoin in Numbers â a Collection of Interesting and Recent Charts,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-in-numbers-a-collection-of-interesting-and-recent-charts/,"Bitcoin charts show many facets of the cryptocurrency’s environment. So far Bitcoin has created a myriad of different markets, value correlations, mining data, and many more constellations of economic measurement. Also Read:Â Japan Has Become a Big Player Within the Bitcoin Economy This week Bitcoin.com gathered a bunch of different charts from our forum showcasing a visual view of everyoneâs favorite cryptocurrency. Over the years, many individuals and organizations have measured certain aspects of the Bitcoin network using graphs and charts. Some of these representations show how Bitcoin has performed over a period of time, and where it stands today.  Bitcoin’s mining distribution has changed quite a bit since the early days. Over the past five years, it shows there are now more mining pools than ever. More recently, an assortment of smaller mining pools have entered the game. Charts show roughly 20 different mining factions command the hashrate distribution in 2017.  On the list of publicly known Bitcoin mines, the country of China still dominates. China’s lead is followed by Georgia, the U.S., Canada, and Iceland. With all the countries combined, a total of 206 mega watts (MW) power known data centers. It should be noted that there are some Bitcoin mines that are not publicly disclosed.  The chart above shows the top five coins by USD trade volume, accordingÂ to Coinmarketcap.com, with Bitcoin being the large blue bar. At press time, Bitcoin’s dominance level is 85.4 percent of the 17 billion USD capitalization. The Bitcoin Dominance Index (BDI) shows a measurement of Bitcoinâs share of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization and includes all the indexed digital currencies.Â The table below shows Bitcoin trading volume from each exchange on 1/28/17.   This chart above shows the volume processed across featured Western cryptocurrency exchanges over the past 90 days.  As the value of Bitcoin increases, people search on Google a whole lot more to get information on the digital asset.   As Bitcoin.comÂ reported, the Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) recently held inspections with the top three Chinese Bitcoin exchanges. The original announcement gave the market a hiccup price-wise, but volatility wasn’tÂ as extreme as some news outlets suggested. Bitcoin was significantly more volatileÂ when the PBOC made announcements concerning the cryptocurrency in 2013. The two charts above show recent data collected during the PBOC announcements in 2013 and 2017. Due to the latest PBOC inspections, exchanges in the country have changed their fee and margin lending policies. Additionally, this past week the top three Chinese exchanges announced adding fees to every Bitcoin trade on their platforms. The chart below shows China’s current market share of the global Bitcoin exchange volume and what it might look like when fees are introduced next month.   In January, Ark Invest and Coinbase revealed new updated data on Bitcoin-as-an-asset-class. According to the data, Bitcoin’s transaction volume increased significantly in 2016, as shown in the graph above. Furthermore, the two firms measure Bitcoin’s correlation with other assets such as real estate, bonds, and oil. Many researchers have noticed the digital currency seems to be an uncorrelated asset class amongst its peers. Charts can be useful to show certain aspects of the Bitcoin network, but are not always entirely accurate. These charts and graphs collected here show that significant changes have been happening in the Bitcoin mining and exchange realm. The data also shows great insights on market volatility and Bitcoin’s leaps-and-bounds in regards to trade and transaction volumes. The Bitcoin network and its tethered economy is vast, and there aren’t enough charts in the world to cover it all. However, with the data people and organizations collect, we can catch a small visual glimpse of this innovative ecosystem. What do you think about these charts and data? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

Nicholas Berthaume, who worked for the Federal Reserve Board in Washington, was sentenced to a year of probation and fined $5,000 for using unauthorized Bitcoin software on a federal server. Also read: Europe Committed to Tightening Digital Currency Rules by End of 2017 The Inspector General for the U.S. Federal Reserve revealed that the former analyst connected to the bank’s network to earn bitcoins. Berthaume was charged with illegally running unauthorized mining software on the Fed’s server from 2012 to 2014. The Office of the Inspector General states that Berthaume plead guilty to unlawful conversion of government property. Initially, Berthaume denied knowing about the crime but later revealed his actions through testimony. According to court documents, Berthaume modified the network security as well, allowing remote access from his home. “This case demonstrates how my office will vigorously pursue Board employees who unlawfully abuse their positions and use government property for personal gain,” Fed Inspector General Mark Bialek explained. After originally denying any wrongdoing, Berthaume deleted the mining software to cover his tracks, the Inspector General detailed. However, from forensic analysis and members of the Federal Reserve System’s National Incident Response Team, the agents found evidence of Berthaume’s involvement. Bialek explained that the analyst was then terminated from the board and “ultimately led to his admission of guilt.” Investigators could not determine how many bitcoins were accumulated by Berthaume’s actions. The Inspector General stated that the agency couldn’t conclusively figure out the profits “due to the anonymity of the Bitcoin network.” Furthermore, Bialek noted that the board’s data was now completely secure and the Board has subsequently implemented better security.   The story of the rogue Federal Reserve employee shows that there are clearly some members of the central bank who are more interested in cryptocurrencies than the private bank’s fiat money.

Also read:Â Venezuelan Bitcoin Miners Arrested for âElectricity Theftâ Bitcoin and cryptocurrency are a popular phenomenon in the Czech Republic and the city of Prague. The region has over 80 merchantsÂ that accept bitcoin and many popular cryptocurrency startups. Czech Republic officials have traditionally had a pretty lenient stance towards digital currencies. According to regional publicationÂ PrÃ¡vnÃ­ rÃ¡dce, authorities are now concerned with money laundering and terrorist financing through digital currencies. On January 1, the Czech Republic initiated its cryptocurrency-related piece of legislation. The policy will requireÂ cryptocurrency exchange operators and other associated services to follow Know-Your-Customer (KYC) procedures. Exchanges must ask each customer forÂ their identity card, gender, nationality, and address. âThere is no longer any option for customers of bitcoin exchanges to hide behind false names or nicknames,â the new guidelines detail. The Czech Republicâs Ministry of Finance may soon require trading exchanges, and various merchants accepting bitcoin to verify the identity of their customers who spend over 1,000â¬, explains the recent reports. Alongside this, the countryâs authorities will also soon add a Value Added Tax (VAT) to virtual currencies in the near future. “Virtual currencies represent an element with which the user can actually disrupt the money trail. It is, therefore, a provision of remuneration in the form of virtual currency that poses the extreme risk of potential abuse for committing tax fraud,” explained theÂ Czech Republic’s Ministry of Finance aboutÂ its new legislation. The recent announcement follows the European Commissionâs latest roadmap to curb the illicit use of cash and cryptocurrencies. The Commission has also noted anÂ urgency of addressing money laundering and criminal financing involved with these types of payments. The agency believes the biggest problem is anonymity and certain restrictions need to be enforced against these private practices. Furthermore, global regulators have convened at an event held in Doha, Qatar, aimed to âtake action against digital currency mixers/tumblers.â The news also follows the recent fine against the cryptoanarchy institute ParalelnÃ­ PolisÂ for not adhering to KYC guidelines. Reportedly, the policies force merchants to use an electronic till that sends the merchant’s transactions to a central database. According to reports, ParalelnÃ­ Polis refused to followÂ the guidelines and were inspected by the Czech Ministry of Finance. The cryptoanarchy organization believes the Czech Republicâs policies go against the very foundations of the groupâs philosophy. âThe State and corporations have data on economic behaviour, and through legislation, they have received complete access to all payment transactions and consumer habits,â a statement from ParalelnÃ­ Polis explains concerning the fine. âNew technology brings the possibility of choice â we are in a time that is defined by the manifesto of cryptoanarchy. With a fast internet connection, reliable anonymity and decentralised currency, you preserve freedom which we have been losing as a society.â UPDATE: Previously the headline of this article erroneously statedÂ that ID was required to buy a coffee in the Czech Republic.

2017-01-30T19:00:54-04:00,How Bitcoin Apps Help People Survive Emerging Market Volatility,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-apps-help-people-market-volatility/,"People in economies suffering from market volatility are turning to Bitcoin applications to help them maintain their standard of living. Workers in Venezuela are using the popular Bitcoin marketplace Purse to save on basic necessities. As well, people in India are escaping the devaluation of their currency with payroll service Bitwage. In each case, Bitcoin seems to be making a difference, according to industry sources.  Also Read: The Who’s Who of the Bitcoinerati   Alongside nations like Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States, the world’s largest Bitcoin marketplace, Purse, has been adopted by individuals in countries stricken by economic hardship. Argentina, India, Venezuela, Brazil, Nigeria, Ukraine, Mexico, Philippines, Italy, and Croatia all rank among the top twenty nations using Purse for its considerable discounts. Each of these nations has experienced either geopolitical or financial turmoil in recent years. “People are currently using Purse in places like Brazil and Venezuela to buy food, beauty products, medicine, and other goods that they cannot purchase or obtain cheaply in their country,” says Steven Mckie, Purse Head of Growth and Product Content. “Countries like Venezuela can make it very difficult for citizens who are not wealthy or have connections to get the everyday essentials they need and maintain some modicum of normality in their day-to-day lives.”  These emerging market nations are comprised predominantly of Android users, who will now be able to use Purse’s Android app, released last week, to quickly earn and store bitcoins, and shop with their cell phone. “If you have a volatile currency like, say, the bolivar, and want to pay for a particular good, it’s best to hold your funds in bitcoin and get the discount on daily essentials through our platform,” Mr. Mckie says. “Furthermore, we can onramp more individuals in emerging markets by offering them a way of making money as a merchant and earning bitcoin.” Thanks to the deployment of an iOS application in November 2016, and the Android app last week, Amazon’s North American marketplace is available to Purse users globally as the company continues to pursue a full-fledged ecommerce solution. Previously, users would have to use the Amazon marketplace associated with their country through the local currency, if Amazon was offered in their country at all. Not anymore. Alongside emerging markets, nations like Japan, Russia, France, Germany, Spain, Poland and the Netherlands appear on the list of Purse hotspots. “Now there are no borders from wherever Amazon users wish to shop, and as long as they’re using bitcoin, without going through local currencies, they will save money doing so,” Mr. Mckie explains. Purse isn’t the only Bitcoin application helping people in emerging markets. “People living in countries with economic instability, such as Venezuela, Brazil and India, can actually make a lot more money if they are working for US, EU and UK companies,” says Bitwage CEO Jonathon Chester. “This is not just because companies in these countries pay higher wages. By leveraging the bitcoin blockchain as an underlying mechanism, you can receive rates much better than interbank rates.” This is demonstrated on Bitwage’s rates page.  For instance, Mr. Chester tells Bitcoin.com, a user in India would make over 20% more if they had received wages through Bitwage in India during the first two weeks of the country’s demonetization of certain notes. This is why Bitwage is launching its new job board, BitWage.Me, which features a reputation system and seeks to connect people in places like the United States and Europe with workers in emerging markets. “So that we can empower local communities around the world to find good jobs and make more money when receiving their salaries,” the CEO says. Similar trends are developing in other countries on the Bitwage platform. “Ukraine is growing, Mexico also happens to be interesting,” says Mr. Chester. “There are basically geographical price arbitrage opportunities in all of these places. Meaning that local demand for bitcoins is higher than global, which means price is higher locally.” Thus, individuals can buy bitcoin at normal prices and sell high in these countries. “This has led up to as much as a 25% premium on your wages during the first couple weeks of the India demonetization crisis that begun November 8th of last year,” Mr. Chester elaborates. “The main way to take advantage of these premiums is through wages/business disbursements, because, unlike traditional arbitrage opportunities, it is a lot harder to get the money out of the countries which they were sent into.” While not every country that is economically unstable has a big or growing bitcoin market currently, it is safe to say that once there is a group that is educated on the subject in the country, a market will develop, according to Mr. Chester.  “As this is the case, it’s interesting to keep an eye on the economically unstable countries,” he says. “The main issue is getting bitcoin in these places, since no one wants the currency of an economically volatile nation, such as Venezuela or India. In order to get bitcoin into the country you either need to mine it there or get paid with bitcoin from overseas.” If you live in an emerging economy, are Bitcoin applications helping you get by?

2017-01-30T06:00:02-04:00,Bitcoin Resilient After Chinese Exchanges Start Charging Transaction Fees,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-resilient-after-chinese-exchanges-start-charging-transaction-fees/,"As the biggest Chinese exchanges announce the implementation of transaction fees, Bitcoin, once again, shows off its inherent capacity to quickly adjust to the ever-changing environment, and to not only recover from adversity but to also get stronger. The latest shock resulting from the imposition of transaction fees by Chinese exchanges caused bitcoin trading volumes to plunge dramatically on January 24, 2017. Now, as bitcoin’s value springs back, puncturing the USD 900 resistance level, trading migrates to non-fee-charging exchanges, and traders renew their optimism about the cryptocurrency. Also Read: Japan Has Become a Big Player within the Bitcoin Economy Bitvc, a bitcoin exchange registered in Hong Kong, joined Okcoin, Huobi, and BTCC in their decision to charge a 0.2 percent fixed trading fee starting on January 24, 2017. Most recently, on January 26, CHBTC announced its plans to start charging fees too. However, the rate of the trading fees remains undetermined.  The Chinese exchanges’ announcements of their decision to start charging transaction fees caused bitcoin trading volumes to decline spectacularly. In this regard, Bloomberg reported, “trading volume has plunged 98 percent compared with the first days of 2017, according to data from bitcoinity.org.” Eradicating these market flaws is precisely BTCC’s objective for charging fees. The BTCC announcement states, “To further curb market manipulation and extreme volatility, BTCChina will start charging fees for bitcoin and litecoin trading from 12:00 p.m. (noon) UTC+8 on Tuesday, January 24th.” In effect, many Bitcoin enthusiasts see benefits resulting from the fees being charged by the Chinese exchanges. For example, Reddit user Blaireau1 believes that trading fees will let us see the true Chinese bitcoin market size. Moreover, according to Blaireau1, “while China still accounts for a fair share of all bitcoin transactions, the reduced share means that any actions now by the Chinese authorities to close off bitcoin will have a far lower impact than was previously thought. This surely reduces volatility and in the longer run will help Bitcoin achieve greater acceptance.” Now, the latest indicators show that trading is shifting to exchanges that do not charge transaction fees. Moreover, other exchanges in the region have been gaining prominence. For instance, as of January 28, 2017, Bitflyer, a Japanese exchange, ranks first in the ‘Bitcoin Exchanges Volume Ranking’, according to data from Coinhills.  Once again Bitcoin’s resilience is being tested. The currency has had to confront a litany of obstacles during its nine years of existence, which include Mt Gox, the Silk Road, and other scandals. Moreover, let’s not forget that in 2013, China’s central bank banned financial institutions from performing transactions with bitcoins. This decision caused the cryptocurrency to crash over 20 percent to below $1,000 USD. Now, the charging of transactions fees by major Chinese exchanges is just the latest episode. The good news is that Bitcoin has always bounced back from any difficulties stronger and reinvigorated. Traders will diversify exchanges and re-adapt to the new ecosystem. Most importantly, the bitcoin market will become more transparent, more stable, less speculative, and better supported by more factual trading volume data. Traders like Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, remain optimistic. Lee said in his Lunar New Year message, “BTCC was successful in 2016. We are working hard to reach greater success in 2017.” Do you think Chinese exchanges charging trading fees will help us see the true size of the Chinese bitcoin trading market?

2017-01-29T19:00:46-04:00,Reluctance to Use Bitcoin Could Haunt Blockchain Labs,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/reluctance-to-use-bitcoin-could-haunt-blockchain-labs/,"From Silicon Valley to Wall Street the ‘blockchain’ concept is hyped, but it’s unclear if a reluctance to use bitcoin will be the downfall of distributed ledgers. The World Economic Forum once posited one-tenth of the world’s GDP could be “on blockchain” by 2025. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance conjectures there are 70 blockchain firms out there. Yet, demos have yet to graduate from the lab and join Bitcoin in the real world.  Also Read: Bitcoin Gains One Million New Wallets Each Quarter  “About the only common element in the wave of initiatives has been a reluctance to use bitcoin,” details Lionel Laurent for Bloomberg. Meanwhile, blockchain pursuits by multinational corporations and financial institutions have garnered much criticism for being nothing more than “regulator-friendly shared databases.” In the first half of 2014, as bitcoin consolidated and retraced the steps of its monumental 2013 all-time highs, R3CEV co-founders David Rutter and Todd McDonald were surveying the cryptocurrency space for startups in which to invest. By 2015 Mr. McDonald casually maintained the company’s blog, even mentioning MLB pitcher Bartolo Colon’s first major league home run which has been called “one of the great moments in the history of baseball.”  In its earliest internet mentions, R3CEV doesn’t mention blockchain. “We specialize in advising clients including global banks, interdealer brokers, exchanges, trading systems and more across the globe,” the company explains. R3 currently runs its subsidiary, Liquidity Edge, which offer US Treasury trading over a peer-to-peer market. Additionally, the blockchain consortium sought to raise $200 million last summer. Sources claimed that a European bank was not happy about R3’s terms, and two other banks were also said to have concerns. Sources say banks dislike their lack of shares in the intellectual property developed by R3 lab, despite contributing resources for the experiments. Banks also reportedly held reservations over how much R3 wished to raise. Ripple received $55 million in September from major banking partners. CEO Chris Larsen promptly left thereafter, citing a desire to spend more time with family. Ripple has noted to email subscribers it will highlight in 2017 its native digital token, XRP. The Linux Foundation’s Hyperledger, partnered with IBM, continues pursuing distributed ledger solutions and adding new members.  R3CEV founders say they prefer blockchain agnosticism. In other words, an in-production Bitcoin has no advantage over research-and-development distributed ledgers. ‘No, it’s not bitcoin!’” Mr. Rutter explained to Risk Magazine his thoughts on Bitcoin maximalism. “It’s an innovation inspired by the use of cryptographic maths, but it’s not about trust-less transfer of value – because of course guys, we all trust each other; our market has documentation and legal underpinnings, and we transfer billions of dollars to each other all the time.” In a 2016 recap, the consortium cited numerous trials throughout the year as reasons for success. R3 executed transactions across a global private network in Microsoft Azure; tested blockchain technologies for fixed income trading; trialed invoice financing and letter of credit (LOC) transactions via smart contracts, as well as Ripple’s XRP in cross-border payments. The New York-based firm also developed a proof-of-concept for a KYC registry. Blockchain technology, however, might face challenges beyond the lab. Data from across the world shows increasing distrust of the very banks with whom R3 is partnered. The majority of UK’s small businesses ignore these bank’s advice. Millennials distrust banks as well. This could prove beneficial to Bitcoin adoption. Since it reached its most recent nadir of $197 in 2014, as Mr. Rutter and Mr. McDonald were formulating the modern-look R3CEV, Bitcoin’s price has steadily increased, peaking at more than $1,000 on New Year’s Day. On July 2, 2014, as R3 announced their vision for blockchain development, at the time there were 432 bitcoin transactions per block. On January 22, 2017 there were 1,703. Bitcoin’s hash rate has increased from 111,195 terahashes per second to more than 3 million. And today, according to Google Trends, ‘Bitcoin’ is a much more popular search term than ‘blockchain.’ Bitcoin’s fastest growing markets include Australia, China, Colombia, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Russia, South Korea and Venezuela. Alongside this, two prominent Bitcoin believers have been associated with U.S. President Donald Trump. Investor Peter Thiel led Mr. Trump’s transition team on matters of science and technology. Bitcoin startup 21 Inc. CEO Balaji Srinivasan is currently being considered to lead the FDA. Perhaps, ignoring Bitcoin will come back to haunt “blockchain.” What do you think the growth of Bitcoin’s user base compared to big bank blockchain trials? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-29T12:00:08-04:00,How Sustainable Will Bitcoin Be After the Apocalypse?,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-sustainable-will-bitcoin-be-after-the-apocalypse/,"Over the past few years, worldwide fears of an apocalypse-type scenario have increased quite a bit. The trend is likely to be associated with global economic turbulence, failed central planning, and the rise of tyrannical governance. With people believing doomsday may come to pass, many are hoarding various commodities like precious metals, and now even bitcoins. However, people wonder how sustainable the Bitcoin network will be throughout a global apocalyptic crisis. Also Read: Needham: Banning Does Not Prevent Bitcoin Adoption The New Yorker recently published a lengthy editorial called “Doomsday Prep for the Super-Rich” detailing some interesting findings on the world’s wealthiest preppers. Of course, the individuals are hoarding the usual supplies of precious metals, rations and building unique bunkers. But one particular rich-prepper, Tim Chang, a venture-capital firm managing director, says the super-rich are also stockpiling Bitcoin. “There’s a bunch of us in the Valley,” Tim Chang details to the New Yorker. “We meet up and have these financial-hacking dinners and talk about backup plans people are doing. It runs the gamut from a lot of people stocking up on Bitcoin and cryptocurrency, to figuring out how to get second passports if they need it, to having vacation homes in other countries that could be escape havens.” At the moment many individuals across the globe are using Bitcoin to avoid capital controls, currency devaluation, and absurd government mandates over a citizen’s wealth. The cryptocurrency has become known as a hedge and even a financial ‘safe haven’ among global investors. However, if there was a catastrophic apocalyptic scenario, would Bitcoin still be maintainable? Bitcoin is an online currency and events such as an electrical grid-outage could affect the network significantly. Bitcoin very much depends on the internet, and the cryptocurrency’s network of miners and nodes depend heavily on electricity. The digital asset could survive quite well if there were no loss of the web or a global electrical power crisis. However, if these particular events took place in an apocalyptic situation, Bitcoin would have a difficult time. Moreover, if the power grid fails, global citizens will have more problems on their hands than worrying about Bitcoin. Yet the blockchain could still survive offline, and node operators and miners could reboot the network as soon as internet connections came back. One Redditor details how the blockchain would not collapse and circulating bitcoins could survive a large electrical outage.       As well as people rebooting the network after a power outage, there may be other ways the network could survive. There have been multiple theories of the blockchain being kept up-to-date with a 2400 HAM-radio baud connection and discussions of rudimentary mesh networks that could keep transactions going. Other concepts like broadcasting the blockchain over the radio have been tested in the past and thoughtful conversations on other ways to keep the network running. The fact of the matter is the human race will strive to restart the electrical system and get the internet running for communication purposes after the smoke clears. It’s definitely possible Bitcoin could very well survive this type of doomsday event. Bitcoin is a remarkable innovation and was released to the public during the 2008 financial collapse. During these times of duress, humans have always figured out ways to conquer the world’s obstacles. Hoarding bitcoins for a doomsday scenario may not be a bad idea as people could use the digital currency in multiple ways for survival. Of course, there are various vulnerabilities to the network the community will have to try to overcome. Yet as the old saying goes, ‘where there’s a will there’s a way.’ Do you think it’s smart to stockpile cryptocurrencies for the apocalypse?

2017-01-29T06:00:35-04:00,10 Bitcoin ATMs Reported Stolen Since 2015,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/10-bitcoin-atms-reported-stolen-since-2015/,"At least ten ‘Bitcoin ATMs’, also known as Bitcoin transaction machines, have been reported stolen in the last two years. Most recently, in a first for Canada, a Lamassu Bitcoin transaction machine was stolen last Sunday night from its Montreal location. Altogether, the ten machines approximate $40,000 worth of hardware.  Also Read: The US Reigns Supreme in the Bitcoin ATM Industry  At least one suspect broke into an Ahuntsic-Cartierville grocery store where a Lamassu-produced machine was located on January 22 at approximately 10:30 PM. The thief(s) broke the glass door of grocer Euromarché Latina 80, located at Laurentien Boulevard and Rue de Louisbourg, then loaded the Lamassu machine into a vehicle before fleeing. Lamassu representative Neal Conner told Bitcoin.com: “This machine was subject to a common attack vector against traditional ATMs: a chain was wrapped around it and a vehicle dragged it out of the floor in which it had been anchored.” The ATM apparently busted through the grocer’s front doors. Montreal has grown into somewhat of a “blockchain hub.” The city’s Bitcoin Embassy dubs itself “the world’s first blockchain technology hub.” There are 32 bitcoin machines in Montreal dispersed throughout the city. Most of them are located in the Ahuntsic-Cartierville borough, where the stolen Bitcoin ATM could be found until last night. Bitcoin ATMs stolen in the past include at least three other Lamassu machines, three General Bytes machines and two BitAccess machines, according to data made available to Bitcoin.com by industry information portal Coinatmradar. A Lamassu machine located at Village Smoke in Atlanta, operated by Coinfucius, was stolen in an incident in late 2015 involving shots fired, but no injuries. The assailant can be seen scoping out the small Bitcoin machine, unplugging it and carrying it out before a co-conspirator fires a warning shot at the ground to ward off any would-be vigilantes. See the video below:  Another Lamassu machine was stolen from the Stadscafe de Waag in the Netherlands. Also, a machine not available to the public in the Netherlands Bitpay office, was stolen according to Coinatmradar. Three ATMs by General Bytes, a European-based producer, have been stolen. One, located in Norwalk and operated by Coinplug, was stolen from a Boost Mobile location. Two General Bytes machines were stolen in Dallas, both operated by ‘BTC Vending.’  One was located in Better Bright LED Lighting, while another at a Shell station. Two Bitaccess machines have been stolen in the U.S. and in Europe. One machine, operated by Easybit, was stolen from Warie’s Thai Restaurant in the Netherlands. A second, operated by Coin Cloud, was stolen from 1 Stop Smoke Shop Vapor and Accessories in Albuquerque. The Bitcoin ATM industry itself is comprised of those who design software and hardware applications to buy and sell bitcoins locally (producers) and those who buy machines from producers and deploy networks of Bitcoin ATMs (operators). With 191 machines deployed globally (not all of which are currently operational), Lamassu represents the second largest Bitcoin ATM producer in the world. The company’s operators have bitcoin machines deployed across the world, including Canada, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam, and other regions, located in gas stations, grocery stores and cafes. Operators have “full control” of a machine’s back-end and private keys. Instacoin operated the machine stolen Sunday. The Canada-based company has machines deployed solely in Canada, allowing you to buy and sell bitcoins for Canadian dollars. Lamassu told Bitcoin.com it is offering full-support to Instacoin in the theft’s wake. Altogether, the ten Bitcoin ATMs stolen, based on Coinatmradar data provided exclusively to Bitcoin.com, cost a lot of money. That is upwards of $40,000 worth of Bitcoin ATMs stolen since 2015, when the data begins. Bitcoin transaction machines have also been the victims of vandals in the midwestern section of the U.S. as of late. Mr. Conner noted: “As Bitcoin ATMs are a growing industry, there will undoubtedly be further such instances as they become more widespread. With each, we and operators learn better practices for overall security and deterrence.” What do you think of Bitcoin ATMs being stolen? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-01-28T19:00:17-04:00,Japan Has Become a Big Player Within the Bitcoin Economy,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/japan-big-player-bitcoin-economy/,"Over the past year, Japan has been laser focused on digital currency and blockchain solutions. Moreover, the country has recently become the second largest Bitcoin trading region in the world. Now one of Japan’s largest IT conglomerates plans on entering the Bitcoin industry with a new wallet and exchange service. Also Read: Making ‘EthereRum’ Distilled by a Bitcoin Miner When it comes to Bitcoin, a lot has changed in Japan since the Mt Gox days. Back in May of 2016, the country’s government defined digital currency as money. Since then, exchanges like Bitflyer, Zaif, and Coincheck have been trading a lot of bitcoin. Alongside this, digital currency and blockchain-related investments within the region have been announced regularly throughout the past year. On January 20, the Japanese-based GMO Internet group announced that it would soon be developing a bitcoin exchange and wallet service. The well-known company which has commanded the country’s IT markets for fourteen years is pleased with the new venture. The firm says it will be providing a safe environment for cryptocurrency trading given its significant background in online securities. “Using the know-how cultivated in the Internet infrastructure and financial businesses as described above, we established ‘GMO Wallet Co., Ltd.’ on October 11, 2016, and have been preparing for a virtual currency exchange”, explains the Japanese IT company’s translated announcement. Prior to the new GMO exchange announcement, Japan has recently taken the number two spot for the country with the most bitcoin trade volume. Steadily racing towards China this past summer, the Japanese exchange Bitflyer revealed exponential trade volume growth. Furthermore, just recently Bitcoin.com reported on the regional exchange Coincheck experiencing significant growth during the new year. Alongside this, the Singapore-based exchange Quoine has pushed some of the highest BTC/JPY trade volumes in the world. The exchange also allows trades in USD, AUD, and other foreign currencies as well as margin lending services. This past June, the startup raised $16 million in a Series B funding round from JAFCO Asia. The company founded in 2014 adds to the growing number of exchanges offering Japanese citizens BTC/JPY trades.  The virtual currency phenomenon has become more popular than ever in the country as Japan’s influence in Bitcoin is hard not to notice. The country has had interesting Bitcoin commercials from Bitflyer and even a cryptocurrency-themed girls game show. Legacy companies in the region are getting onboard with these emerging technologies and startups like Techbureau are telling Japanese residents about digital currency solutions. Meanwhile, Japan hit its highest Localbitcoins volumes last winter and has shown consistent volume increases throughout the year. Japan is one country to keep your eyes on within the Bitcoin environment.  What do you think about Japan’s position in the Bitcoin world? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-28T14:00:30-04:00,Bitcoin Powerhouse Bitfury Initiates Global Blockchain Business Council in Davos,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-powerhouse-bitfury-initiates-global-blockchain-business-council-in-davos/,"Last week at the World Economic Forum 2017 Annual Meeting in Davos, Switzerland, the technology firm Bitfury announced the formation of the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC). The initiative grew from Bitfury’s latest partnership with international law firm Covington. GBBC represents an association of leading businesses and executives from around the world who are paying particular attention to Bitcoin and blockchain solutions. Also read: Don’t Expect to See Kim Dotcom’s Bitcoin Babies Until Later this Year The newly created GBBC association is aimed at educating the world’s leading companies about the latest advances in blockchain technology. The founding members consist of individuals and businesses involved in technology, banking, government, and academia. The first thirty-three founding members are representatives from twenty-five nation states, such as Australia, Argentina, Barbados, Brazil, Canada, China, Estonia, France, Haiti, Hong Kong, India, Latvia, the Netherlands, and more. “There is a huge need for a global body dedicated to bringing the blockchain ecosystem together, educating, advocating for its advancement and connecting relevant parties in the blockchain and business worlds,” said Valery Vavilov, CEO of the Bitfury Group. “At the GBBC’s inaugural launch event, some of the most strategic thinkers in the blockchain and business worlds came together to forge partnerships across sectors and understand how this technology can and will change the way we all do business.” The Bitfury founder details the company is humbled by the enthusiasm shown during the creation of GBBC. Vavilov believes that global businesses need such organizations to educate and advocate cryptocurrency and blockchain initiatives. Companies which took part in the meeting include Paypal, Bitpesa, Gemini Investment Group, Overstock.com, the MIT Digital Currency Initiative, Hyperledger, and Consensys. “The GBBC is meant to be a truly global body for the Blockchain and business ecosystems — our founding members will be critical to ensuring we are always presenting a global front and that we stay on the leading edge of Blockchain innovations around the world,” Vavilov stated. Bitfury’s co-founding of the GBBC organization shows the company wants to continue its leadership in the cryptocurrency and distributed ledger space. The company has relentlessly held its leadership position in the Bitcoin and blockchain world since the startup was founded in 2012. Since then investors have injected over $90 million into the company, and the firm has been well known for its custom ASIC silicon chips, printed circuit boards (PCB), servers, and Bitcoin data centers. The company has also invested in Bitcoin-based startups such as Bitpesa and is in the midst of building a technology center in Georgia. The creation of the GBBC is yet another effort by Bitfury to push cryptocurrency and blockchain-related innovations worldwide. Vavilov recently shared his stance on the Bitcoin network, claiming there is only one blockchain:   What do you think about Bitfury’s creation of the GBBC? Let us know in the comments below.

According to reports on January 27, the Organized Crime Bureau of the Bolivarian National Police (BNP) shut down an 11,000 unit Bitcoin mining undertaking. Also read: Venezuelan Bitcoin Miners Arrested for ‘Electricity Theft’ The current socialist regime of Venezuela has recently been shutting down cryptocurrency mining operations in the country. The latest “camouflaged facility” was located in the city of Valencia, Carabobo state and held roughly eleven thousand mining rigs. The BNP authorities say the takedown was part of an “arduous investigation” working with local law enforcement. According to two Spanish-language news publications, Venezuelan law enforcement arrested Eusebio Gómez Henríquez (51) and Andrés Alejandro Carrero Martínez (35). Charges against the alleged criminals were illegal international transmissions to Poland, computer crime, exchange fraud, and electricity theft. The local police had detected the Bitcoin mine within an industrial area located near the municipality of Guayas with vehicles continuously going in and out of the building. Furthermore, it seems Venezuelan officials are targeting Bitcoin mining operations across the country as the local report states: Reports also claimed the Venezuelan mining operation possibly had a relationship with miners from Poland and purchased the facility’s equipment from the country. According to sources the eleven thousand mining rigs may have been purchased in August of 2015 and transported to the Venezuelan industrial park. Alongside this, the suspected owners of the operation were found connected to various social media platforms such as Linkedin. Andrés Carrero was a graduate of business and finance at Miami-Dade College and a Namstec employee since 2004. The latest Bitcoin mining bust in Carabobo is similar to this past week’s takedown in Charallave, Venezuela. As Bitcoin.com reported the news publication, Criptonoticias had mentioned unconfirmed criminal investigations in regards to local Bitcoin mines. Additionally, the mining operation in Charallave was also caught using social media sources consisting of pictures of the mines and units. Furthermore, there have been numerous headlines over the past couple of months detailing that some Venezuelans are turning a profit in the Bitcoin mining space. Currently, the Venezuelan government doesn’t have any laws against Bitcoin mining. Moreover, officials in the country have not banned cryptocurrency use or exchange operations. However, electricity in the country is subsidized significantly, and authorities seem to be focused on electricity theft. The case in Charallave explains the Corps of Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigations (CICP) believe money laundering and stealing power was involved.  What do you think about the latest Venezuelan Bitcoin mining arrests? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-28T06:00:15-04:00,Washington State Liquor & Cannabis Board OK with Bitcoin for Pot,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/washington-state-liquor-cannabis-board-ok-bitcoin-pot/,"The Washington State Senate recently heard arguments about SB 5264, a bill to ban virtual currency use in the cannabis industry. Founders of Payqwick, which some refer to as the “Paypal of Pot”, spoke for banning Bitcoin. Founders of Bitcoin point-of-sale service Posabit, as well as a lawyer from Perkins Coie, spoke against a virtual currency ban for cannabis businesses. The state’s Liquor and Cannabis Board (LCB) spoke briefly after each party presented their case. Also Read: A Cannabis Industry Icon Accepts Bitcoin “We just follow the Department of Financial Institutions lead on this issue,” said James Paribello, legislative liaison for the LCB. “They have licensed businesses, [and] there are businesses licensed by us operating in this space and accepting and transacting through [bitcoin].” When asked whether or not the LCB has concerns about how Posabit uses Bitcoin for cannabis payments, the LCB said it did not. “We rely on the [Division of Financial Institutions] to make the call as to who can play in this space and since the DFI has said it’s okay, we’re okay,” said Mr. Paribello. Senate members were clearly interested in learning more not just about Bitcoin, but virtual currency. “When I read about Bitcoin on the international space, it’s talked about with international drug transactions, the black economy, a way to get around currency controls, a way government can track things and anonymity,” shared Senator Michael Baumgartner. During the discussion, he heard reasons for and against his impressions. “It’s not that we don’t like Bitcoin in general,” Payqwick president Kenneth Berke told the Senators. “Bitcoin certainly has a use in other industries, but we think there is an issue with respect to Bitcoin in marijuana transactions, because of the lack of transparency,” Payqwick president Burke told senate members. “With bitcoin, there is no traceability.”  Perkins Coie lawyer Joseph Cutler, born and raised on a family farm in Spokane, spoke against a Bitcoin for pot ban. “Before we regulate currency [we] might want to understand how it works,” said Mr. Cutler. “What are the benefits? What does it do? It is a transparent, auditable transaction ledger. Every transaction done today is posted to that public ledger. This idea that it’s untraceable is simply false. People say Bitcoin is anonymous, that’s also false. We call Bitcoin pseudonymous, which is better than cash. In marijuana, cash is king, and there’s no traceability of customers for cash spent in marijuana stores. In virtual currency, that is not the case.”  Co-founders of Posabit, which is a registered money service business and money transmitter, outlined their Bitcoin-driven solution for the Washington State cannabis industry. “Cash is dangerous,” said Posabit founder Ryan Hammond. “It’s dangerous to hold, dangerous to move, and you become a target of potential crimes.” Posabit requires identification, credit card number, other data, and sells the customers no more than $150 worth of bitcoin per day for marijuana purchases.  “If law enforcement has questions about a certain transaction, and if they paid in cash, there is no way to answer this question,” said Posabit Chief Compliance Officer, John Baugher. “But with the Posabit service they have ultimate traceability.” The Perkins Coie lawyer suggested to Washington State senate a working session to discuss facts on Bitcoin. “Yeah, I think there is a lot we are curious about,” Mr. Baumgartner agreed.  The LCB reports less than 10% of state cannabis businesses now pay the state in cash, according to Director of Licensing and Regulation for the LCB, Becky Smith. Customers, however, are still largely paying cash for their pot in the state. That fact that Bitcoin might minimize the amounts of cash being driven around Washington State in armored vehicles intrigued the Washington Senate members.

Cryptoseed uses strong cryptography to turn your seed phrase into something no one else can use. Also read: Review of the Cold Storage Hardware Wallet Cryptosteel  A recovery seed word phrase typically comprises 12 to 24 words right out of a dictionary. Keeping it offline in this format may be safe from hackers but not from people who come across it physically and know how to use it. “Writing down your BIP32 recovery seeds on plain paper might be solid electronic security, but terrible physical security,” explains Arlen Anderson, Cryptoseed developer on his project page. “Not everyone has a safe they can keep stuff like that in.” Cryptoseed is an open-source desktop application for Windows and Linux, with OSX on the way. It is currently available for all to download and inspect the code on Github. Anderson explained: After a quick download and installation from Anderson’s Github page, opening the app will give you a simple black box asking you to input a seed and a password. Recovery is impossible without the password so be sure to choose something you will remember. After carefully typing in your seed and adding your password, clicking the ‘encrypt’ button will make your computer crunch the phrase for a moment. It will then give you an encrypted seed with a QR code to download for holding your seed in PNG format. Either the encrypted seed or the QR code file will recover your wallet, just as the original seed phrase does. Recovery is the same process in reverse, using either the encrypted seed or the QR code. After inputting the encrypted seed and password, clicking ‘decrypt’ will recreate the old seed word list. At press time, recovery from a QR code is not supported in the app so users will have to scan the QR code using a different app. Once decrypted, the original seed word list is back and can be used just as before to recover your bitcoin wallet. Unless stored in a fireproof safe or using Cryptosteel, Cryptoseed will not protect your seed phrase from a fire. However, it does add a valuable layer of security against theft. Both your password and recovery seed are “encrypted with the Cipher Block Chaining (CBC) mode of the Advanced Encryption Standard with a 256-bit key length,” according to Anderson. Cryptoseed then generates the final seed with other randomness included and processes it all together one million times with SHA512 hashing. Due to all the randomness, “encrypting the same data with the same key will yield a different result every time,” he added. The real danger is losing your password which, if lost, the seed would be lost forever. For added security, Anderson also suggested using Cryptoseed on an offline computer so no keyloggers nor other spyware can steal your seed. Do you think Cryptoseed is useful?

2017-01-27T12:00:58-04:00,How Trump’s Wall and Remittance Tax Could Give Bitcoin a Boost,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-wall-remittance-tax-bitcoin-boost/,"President Donald Trump earlier this week signed an executive order to start building a wall on the U.S – Mexico border, fulfilling the promise he made during his presidential campaign. He has also threatened to halt or tax remittances from the U.S. to Mexico to help pay for the wall; a move which could potentially boost interest in Bitcoin. Also read: Trump’s Trade War With China Could Boost Chinese Bitcoin Demand   An executive order signed by the President is legally binding. The wall along the 2,000-mile border is estimated to cost between $12 billion and $15 billion, according to Senate leader Mitch McConnell. However, deputy director of the U.S. Immigration Policy Program at the Migration Policy Institute, Marc Rosenblum, estimates that the actual cost could exceed $25 billion. The U.S. government would also have to spend as much as $750 million a year to maintain the wall, according to an analysis conducted by Politico. Yet, many have said that the wall is impractical, expensive and ineffective for border control. Nonetheless, the executive order is signed and McConnell said Congress will follow through on Trump’s border wall order. Now, the President has to find a way to pay for the wall, and to do so, he is considering halting or taxing remittances from the U.S. to Mexico. Experts say that Mexicans will likely find a way to get cash across the border without paying taxes on them if President Trump does halt or tax remittances somehow. The head of Latin America research at Goldman Sachs, Alberto Ramos, said: According to recent data from the World Bank, personal remittances received in Mexico exceeded $26 billion in 2015. However, “the amount being sent through Bitcoin is negligible”, Tomas Alvarez Melis, CEO of Volabit, told Bitcoin.com. Volabit is a Mexican Bitcoin exchange and remittance service whose investors include Tim Draper and Barry Silbert. “I do not think there will be a direct correlation between the blocking or taxing of remittances and bitcoin volume growth”, he noted. “The reason I don´t think bitcoin would take the front seat is due to the fact that it is hard for immigrants to access bitcoin in the U.S.” He described various problems Mexican immigrants have such as having no bank accounts or no Social Security Numbers, making it difficult for them to use websites such as Coinbase. “I also do not see Localbitcoins as a viable option, the experience is too convoluted when compared to the simplicity of sending money through western union”, he noted. However, Melis outlined a few conditions which could cause Mexican bitcoin remittances to surge. Firstly, the tax on remittances would have to be large enough to compel people to switch to bitcoin. Secondly, there needs to be “a service or services geared towards this Hispanic population with a very simple and streamlined process for buying and remitting bitcoin.” These services must speak Spanish but should not require bank accounts or social security numbers to use. Thirdly, he said there needs to be “a way for these services to not be targeted by the regulators the same way Western Union would be targeted to enforce the new rules”. Meanwhile, Bitcoin startup Abra is getting ready to enter the space next month to provide peer-to-peer remittance services globally including to Mexico. People on both sides of Trump’s wall will be able to send and receive money instantly, privately, and securely using smartphones, without having a bank account.

The arrest comes at a time of turmoil in Venezuela’s economy, with some individuals turning to Bitcoin. Also read: Review of the Cold Storage Hardware Wallet Cryptosteel In the early morning of January 25, Venezuela’s director of the Corps of Scientific, Penal and Criminal Investigations (CICPC) revealed the arrest of four individuals involved in Bitcoin mining. According to the report, Alberto José Zapata Orta, Ana Cecilia Farias Villanueva, Néstor Rafael Amundaray Precilla, and Kevin David Ojeda Díaz were in custody for alleged “electricity theft.” The accused miner’s Instagram account showed the group had roughly 300 miners from brands like Spondoolies and Antminers. The news outlet details the mining operation was found in a town close to the border, where foreign currencies are often traded. The report also explains the accused will face charges of cyber fraud and for stealing electricity. Criptonoticias says that there have been other reports of this type of activity in the country that have yet to be confirmed. “Previously, similar cases have been reported in Venezuela, although some have not been officially confirmed,” explains the spanish-language Bitcoin publication. “The tense political and economic situation in the country has led to the adoption of the cryptocurrency in this country since Bitcoin offers many freedoms that Venezuelans can not enjoy in an overly controlled economy and a clear recession.”  Venezuela isn’t the only country where people are getting in trouble for ‘electricity theft.’ This past September two Dutch brothers from Rotterdam, Netherlands were arrested for stealing electricity to mine Bitcoins. The region’s Openbaar Ministerie detailed authorities had confiscated 200.000 euros and Bitcoin mining equipment. Additionally, there have been reports this past summer from China where people were accused of stealing power to run cryptocurrency mining operations. The Chinese publication Weibo reported Ma’anshan police took down three facilities and a large quantity of mining devices. Other Chinese news outlets have reported similar findings of so-called ‘Bitcoin electricity bandits’ this past December. In the recent arrests in Venezuela, authorities believe money laundering may have been involved. However, Criptonoticias explains average citizens are using bitcoin to purchase necessities that are not readily available in the country. Everyday items such as “cornmeal, milk, baby diapers, butter, soap, detergent, antiperspirants and toothpaste” are purchased with the cryptocurrency. The report further details bitcoin’s buying power, stating: The news outlet suggests it’s not the first time Venezuela’s socialist government has persecuted individuals for using their own wealth, nor will it be the last.

On the anniversary of authorities seizing Megaupload, Dotcom told the public he had an announcement about his new Megaupload and Bitcache project. A few days later Dotcom revealed there would be a significant delay. Also read: Kim Dotcom: Bitcache Will Be ‘Off Chain Due to Limitations’ The infamous Kim Dotcom has always been an international man of mystery. This past summer the Megaupload creator revealed Bitcoin would be an integral part of his new Mega 2.0 project (MU2). The platform, Bitcache, was also revealed as a part of the new Mega-project, which would link every file transfer “to a tiny Bitcoin microtransaction.” Dotcom detailed: “I can tell you that Megaupload and Bitcoin had sex. There is a pregnancy, and I have a feeling that the baby will be such a joy.” The project raised funds using the Banktothefuture investment platform. Investors were given explanations to some of the technical questions asked by the crypto-community, such as why Bitcache would operate off-chain. “As you all know the Bitcoin blockchain currently has limitations to the number of transactions that it can handle,” Dotcom remarked. This past week Dotcom once again told the world he had an exciting announcement concerning MU2 and Bitcache. But then a couple of hours later Dotcom was tweeting to his followers that the announcement would not happen that day. “It is unlikely that we can make a full January 20th launch happen. The fund-raising was delayed, and the legal team needed more time for the new setup. But we will reveal more details about Megaupload 2 and Bitcache on that special day,” Dotcom announced. On January 23rd the reasons why the MU2 launch announcement never happened were revealed. It seems the Bitcache board members had a disagreement with a publicly listed Canadian firm over an exchange merger deal. “The Bitcache board has decided that the complexities of the proposed merger would be unnecessary burdens in this early stage of growth,” the project’s announcement reads. “We are looking forward to a beta launch of Megaupload 2.0 and Bitcache later this year.” As the news of the delayed launch reached the ears of the public, many people were quite dismayed by the negative announcement. One commenter writes, “screw that. Bitcache is the most valuable piece of internet property out there, either good terms or no terms.” Other people thought the delay announcement was quite amusing and said, “Later this year, LOL!” Overall, many people were disappointed to hear the news and asked Dotcom when they could expect the project to be released. Over the course of the past few days, Kim Dotcom has kept tweeting about his beloved projects. When questioned about development Dotcom states, “Remember it only took two developers and one designer to build Mega in six months. We now have twelve people working on MU2 and Bitcache, and we’re adding more.” Additionally, he explains that the first Mega experienced many roadblocks and “MU2 is going smooth in comparison.” Investors and spectators will just have to wait for the ‘Mega-Bitcoin baby’ to be born. For now, it’s still gestating in the womb. What do you think about Kim Dotcom’s projects MU2 and Bitcache being delayed? Let us know in the comments below.

The country’s Bitcoin adoption is accelerating, and several factors indicate that it could outpace most other countries soon. Also read: Korea Steadily Becoming a Cryptocurrency and Fintech Hub  Korea, with a population of over 50 million, has a large remittance market. The most recent World Bank estimates show remittance inflows of $6.7 billion and outflows of more than $8.3 billion for Korea. Korbit, the first bitcoin exchange in the country with 33,500 registered traders, is one of the top two exchanges by volume. Through its product called Hyphen, the company offers a service which helps businesses send payments to any bank account in 30 countries globally using bitcoin. Bitcoin.com caught up with Tony Lyu, Korbit CEO, to discuss why Korea looks set for an explosive growth in Bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin.com (BC): Bitcoin can be easier bought in South Korea than most other countries. How did Korea become so Bitcoin-friendly? Korbit (KB): Koreans are inherently familiar with virtual currencies. Korean gaming companies such as Nexon pioneered in-game virtual currencies in free-to-play games in the early 2000s. A major bank (KEB Bank) even created a virtual branch in a Korean social network (Cyworld) to provide banking services for the network’s digital token. As such, Koreans have gone past the “if” phase of virtual currencies, and even the “when” phase, and is now at the “which” phase, as in, “which virtual currency is most useful for my needs?” For some use cases, Bitcoin is the answer. BC: Korea is consistently among the top countries for Bitcoin trading volumes worldwide. Can you explain how Bitcoin as a payment method has been growing? KB: Bitcoin for merchant payments has not yet taken off in Korea, probably because alternative methods of electronic payment are already widespread. Bitcoin for international remittances, however, is popular. I believe this use case has been a significant driver for the growth in trading volume in Korea. BC: Do many people use your service for remittances? KB: Yes, we see a lot of expat workers signing up to Korbit to take advantage of bitcoin for international transactions. They can be English teachers from developed countries such as the US, or migrant workers from developing countries such as the Philippines. Bitcoin has already taken a significant market share for some remittance corridors originating from South Korea. An article on Quartz estimated that 20% of Korea-to-Philippines remittance volume is settled in Bitcoin. BC: How fast do you expect Bitcoin adoption in Korea to grow going forward? KB: I expect Korean bitcoin adoption to outpace that of most other countries this year, as the Korean government introduces bitcoin exchange licensing regulations and clarifies the regulatory status of bitcoin-based cross-border remittances. BC: Can you describe the South Korean government’s stance on bitcoin? Are they more accepting of bitcoin than most other governments? What reasons do they have to be open to bitcoin? KB: Korea’s Financial Services Commission has said they will propose regulatory frameworks for Bitcoin-based businesses this year. Many Korean technology companies are competitive globally, but few, if any, Korean financial companies can say the same. Bitcoin provides a great opportunity for Korean fintech companies to compete in the global market without the disadvantage of being held back by Korea’s local currency. It seems like the Korean government recognizes this and is looking to support Korean Bitcoin companies venturing into the global market.

2017-01-25T09:00:19-04:00,Is a ‘Core of Bitcoin Core’ Hostile to Competing Code?,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/is-a-core-of-bitcoin-core-hostile-to-competing-code/,"Developers recall a time when they were “all just developing for ‘Bitcoin.’” Many to this day make clear they don’t belong to any ‘team’ submitting protocol code per the ‘Bitcoin block size debate,’ and simply write code to be used in Bitcoin. Also Read: Why Bitcoin is Close to a Record Breaking 3 Exahashes of Processing Power Yet various camps, which on the outside seem to be competing with one another, submit code to be used by Bitcoin’s open-source community.  While it’s true there is more than one ‘team’ which submits Bitcoin development code, each with their own method, communication between the teams is mostly amicable, insiders tell Bitcoin.com.  “But, there is a certain ‘Core of the Core’ that is very hostile towards those who are working on competing implementations of Bitcoin,” feels Dr. Peter Rizun, a Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) developer who holds a doctorate in physics. To his point, a post recently appeared on Reddit: simply a photo of Wladimir Van der Laan, to whom bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen entrusted Bitcoin’s “Core” Github repository keys. The point of the post posited Mr. Van der Laan as Bitcoin’s “single point of failure,” and tied him to Blockstream, a private “blockchain” company that pays Bitcoin ‘Core’ developers. That threads’ most upvoted comment reads: “…He has made a lot of decisions. He is the man with the technical YES/NO buttons. He says yes or no to every single line of code in core to be published. Call him maintainer, gardener, the guy who gives water to roses, I don’t care. He has the responsibility of what is published from the core repository. It’s not a vote. It’s not a powwow where all the core devs reach consensus in a group orgasm. It’s a hierarchical system, and he is on top in the Github hierarchy. I think he is in the pocket of Blockstream AND under the elbow of [Blockstream co-founder] Gregory Maxwell. 120% Stockholm syndrome while drowning in fiat. Make the man responsible for the decision he makes with the power Gavin gave him.” Ultimately, in the confusion surrounding Craig Steven Wright’s claims of being Satoshi Nakamoto, and Mr. Andresen’s confirmation thereof based on circumstantial evidence, Mr. Van der Laan locked Mr. Andresen out of Bitcoin Core’s Github, suggesting his accounts could be compromised. Core developers insist they aren’t shills for a private company. “There are a number of companies providing resources for Core development, not just Blockstream,” Bitcoin core developer Eric Lombrozo told Bitcoin.com. “For instance, Chain Code Labs, BitFury, BTCC, and my firm Ciphrex to name a few.” He suggests the companies have simply found a way for Bitcoin developers to finally get paid for their work. In the past, former Bitcoin “Chief Scientist”, Mr. Andresen, was paid for a time by the Bitcoin Foundation. Mr. Lombrozo adds: “All [Bitcoin development] is done completely in the open, everyone is welcome to join. There is no ulterior motive here other than building good software.” “I think there are basically two schools of thought,” says Dr. Rizun. “Theory 1: They were bought-off to change Bitcoin into something that could be controlled and slowed. Theory 2: They believe that Bitcoin is very fragile and they need to manage every aspect of it, otherwise it will break.” Dr. Rizun leans towards Theory 2.  Developers allege a “change of tune” that the ‘core of Core’ had towards increasing the block size limit in recent years, censorship, alleged efforts by ‘core of core’ to shape the development narrative, as well as income from namely Blockstream. Dr. Rizun calls the latter a “conflict of interest.”  ‘Bitcoin-XT’ was the first code repository built to try to get Bitcoin development “back-on-track” to being the electronic peer-to-peer cash system Satoshi Nakamoto described in his white paper. QT, Classic, and Unlimited followed. BU developers represent themselves as a politically motivated group on their website.  “In the Bitcoin Core variant, we do NOT see a venue for these actors to formally express their desires in regards to the evolution of the network,” reads the Bitcoin Unlimited website. “Instead we see a project controlled by a small group of developers employed by finance-oriented for-profit startup companies, and the emergence of corporate products (Lightning network, Side-chains and permissioned ledgers) that would materially benefit from a Bitcoin network that is incapable of handling the transactional demand required for a worldwide public good.” When the block size debate broke out in 2014, essentially one unified team split up, explains BU president Andrew Clifford. “Unfortunately, the modern ‘Core’ team ended up in control of the original Github repo.”  An enormous number of developers have been driven away from Bitcoin because of the ‘core’ of Core being a like-minded clique, contends Mr. Clifford. “Core people do not want any perceived threat to their reference client, even though this makes Bitcoin stronger through decentralized development,” he told Bitcoin.com Mr. Lombrozo disagrees. “Practically none of the Bitcoin Core contributors are against other implementations,” he says. “Projects like btcd, bcoin, libbitcoin, BitcoinJ, et. cetera have never really been an issue. They don’t break the network consensus and, therefore, do not fork the ledger itself.” There has been a rotating cast of Bitcoin developers over the years. Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik have seen their roles evolve in the past near-decade since Bitcoin’s genesis block. Tom Zander, Tom Harding, and Dagur Valberg have long been active. New people are also “stepping up.” For instance, Peter Tschipper, Andrew Stone, Andrea Suisani are active now. Pre-block size debate they only made minor code contributions. Many more individuals contribute ideas and code to the project.  This is perfectly in line with Bitcoin’s organizing tenets. “Bitcoin Core is just a free open source software project, there’s no formal organization beyond that,” says Mr. Lombrozo. “We all contribute on our own initiative, and anyone is free to grab our stuff and do whatever they want with it. We’re not really trying to sell things in a marketing sense, but, rather, just proposing technical ideas.”  Alternative client developers, who insist that in the scheme of things development between all teams is “amicable,” largely share similar feelings.  “What we do is open-source and public,” Bitcoin Classic release manager Tom Zander tells Bitcoin.com. “If BU and Classic hide our technical discussions we can’t learn from each other. It won’t have any positive effect as all our work is open and available for all to see.” What do you think about the development process? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-24T19:00:16-04:00,"In the Battle Between Google, Facebook, and Amazon Against Banks: Bitcoin Will Be the Winner",Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/in-the-battle-between-google-facebook-and-amazon-against-banks-bitcoin-will-be-the-winner/,"As the banking industry struggles to keep its competitive advantage, experts mull the possibility of Google, Facebook, Apple, and Amazon snatching from banks the exclusivity to provide financial services. Internet companies applying better technology and data could offer higher quality services than banks, provided they use Bitcoin as the primary currency. Otherwise, the vices and complications inherent in fiat currencies would not only persist, but they would also be exacerbated. Also read: Prominent Investment Banker Says Banks Will Be Irrelevant Soon The flow of recent news shows that the banking industry is under stress. Big banks are cutting jobs. According to Reuters, “HSBC has begun cutting around 100 senior jobs in its investment banking division worldwide this week, according to sources with direct knowledge of the matter.” In parallel, HSBC and other banks are nervously developing strategies to survive Brexit’s impact. Taxpayers continue to bailout traditional banks. According to Bloomberg, “Italy’s banks are struggling under the weight of a 360 billion-euro mountain of bad loans, a plight that has eroded profitability and undermined investor confidence. The nationalization of Monte Paschi could be followed by rescues for lenders including Veneto Banca SpA and Banca Popolare di Vicenza as part of the government package.” Bad loans, poor profits, and Brexit are not the only problems facing the obsolete banking industry. Banks need to innovate to become radically nimbler, simpler, and cheaper if they wish to sustain a competitive advantage vis-à-vis potential competitors from the social media. For example, asking a traditional bank for a working capital loan is a complex and time-consuming process. Moreover, banks are expensive and they might not lend you the amount of money your business requires. “Interest rates for small-business loans from traditional banks can be quite high, and the amount of bank funding for which a business qualifies is often not sufficient to completely meet its needs,” according to American expatriate entrepreneur, marketing analyst and Web developer, John DeMerceau. “The high-interest rate for the funding a business does receive often stunts its expansion because the business needs to not only service the loan but also deal with additional funding to cover funds not provided by the bank.” Retailers and small entrepreneurs are now finding support, not from traditional banks but from unconventional sources, which operate in the realm of the Internet. Amazon provides loans to small businesses. Indeed, in 2016, “Sellers on Amazon worldwide used capital from Amazon Lending loans to grow sales by an estimated $4 billion. The Amazon Lending program offers business loans to invited sellers on Amazon to help them grow their businesses,” says an Amazon press release. Amazon has long been providing credit card services and now it is stepping up its efforts to increase the number of Amazon credit card users. Most recently, in January 2017, Amazon announced the introduction of the New Prime Rewards Visa card, offering several benefits, such as 5% back on all amazon.com purchases, 2% back at restaurants, gas stations, and drugstores, and 1% back on all other purchases. Moreover, this card does not charge annual fees. Google through its venture capital arm, GV, offers startups “world-class engineers, designers, physicians, scientists, marketers, and investors who work together to provide these startups exceptional support on the road to success.” In October 2016, Facebook was granted a license to execute payment services by the Central Bank of Ireland. The possibility of social media organizations offering financial services functions that have been traditionally offered by outmoded banks and financial institutions recently attracted the attention of the social media giant Linkedin. Walden Siew, Linkedin Senior News Editor, asked “Will Google, Amazon, and Facebook become banks?” To which, Siew’s readers, Landa Grembi replied, “Google, Amazon, and Facebook acting as banks is not news anymore.” And Tarun Sukhani affirms “They already are. They own all our information!” Using traditional business processes and fiat money, even if they are supported by the latest technology, will not really improve things for customers. Indeed, using the three-thousand-year-old fiat monetary system is incompatible with the democratic, borderless, digital, and fast-moving new economy. On the other hand, Bitcoin has much to offer to an Internet of Things financial system: transparency, decentralization, neutrality, and security. Bitcoin also provides a degree of anonymity, no charge-backs, and low transaction costs. Thus, as social media and Internet companies continue to expand their financial services, they will also continue to threaten traditional banks. By providing real-time, borderless, frictionless services enabled by Bitcoin and its blockchain technology, social media and Internet companies can ultimately ensure their dominance over banks.

2017-01-24T12:00:38-04:00,The Qtum Project Creates a Mixture of Bitcoin and Ethereum,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/qtum-project-mixture-bitcoin-ethereum/,"A new project called Qtum has been created by the Singapore-based Quantum Foundation that plans to meld the Bitcoin protocol with Ethereum technology. The open source project integrates the Ethereum Virtual Machine with Bitcoin’s Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) model and aims to provide smart contracts to businesses worldwide. Also read: SEC Delays Decision on SolidX Bitcoin Trust The project Qtum is an interesting decentralized app (Dapp) venture that combines the Bitcoin client 0.13, Proof of Stake (PoS), and the Ethereum Virtual Machine to enable smart contract services. The project has also received $1 million in funding from investors such as Fenbushi partner Bo Shen, Ethereum co-founder Anthony Di Iorio, BitFund founder Xiaolai Li, and more. Qtum’s goal is to provide a value transfer protocol Dapp platform with the best properties of both projects. “Qtum integrated the EVM onto a UTXO-based blockchain, and writing contracts for this should be just as easy as for Ethereum, but you get the benefits of the UTXO model,” explains Qtum developer Jordan Earlz. “These benefits include mobile/light wallet support by SPV, a more stable model (whereas Ethereum has forked many times to fix problems with this), and compatibility with existing Bitcoin tools and protocols.” The Qtum development team details how the platform will allow both smart contracts and master contracts that include off-chain data. The Qtum project explains to the publication 8btc that master contracts accomplish much more than typical smart contracts. “A contract signed by two banks could be terminated with the consensus of the two banks alone,” states the Quantum Foundation. “A master contract gives total control to the contract-signers over the execution or termination of the contracts. That’s a mimic of real-life scenario. The Master Contract is a great step forward, bringing new potential to the blockchain application and extending the concept of smart contract.” The project also claims to be the first to implement a smart contract system utilizing Bitcoin’s UTXO while also integrating a Proof of Stake mechanism. The network consensus is referred to as IPOS (Incentivized Proof of Stake) which the developers say rewards the network participants.   The Qtum team has built two Dapp projects so far including SpringEmail and Qloha. Both services utilize cryptocurrency solutions that enhance messaging applications and Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (STMP). According to the team, the Qtum project is in the midst of creating desktop and mobile wallets for its user base. After extensive testing, the developers plan to unveil its testnet application dubbed “Sparknet” which will be the prelude to the official platform launch. Qtum also has disclosed that the team will be seeking out code reviews from independent individuals and organizations willing to experiment with the project. The project is pleased to utilize the Bitcoin protocol within the Qtum project, stating that the Bitcoin blockchain is the most dependable public distributed ledger available. “Bitcoin is the most mature, stable and secure blockchain available, in comparison to Ethereum or Bitshares or others which are still considered unstable with the numerous problems and security issues they had since they launched,” says the Qtum team. “In addition to Bitcoin having the biggest support from the community which offers a large collection of tools and software related to Bitcoin which can be used by quantum as well, in contrast to the other blockchains which sometimes lack even the simplest software.” What do you think of the Qtum project mixing Bitcoin with Ethereum and Proof of Stake consensus?

Many open source projects like Linux have started with the source code followed by a myriad of alternative implementations. However, for some reason, in the Bitcoin space alternative clients using the source code in a different manner and even writing the code in another programming language, has been controversial. Also Read: Needham: Banning Does Not Prevent Bitcoin Adoption Currently, there is a very vocal discussion happening within the Bitcoin community concerning the protocol’s scalability. Since Bitcoin’s inception, there have been thousands of conversations on how to better scale Bitcoin. There have been lots of talks concerning a few alternative implementations introduced, such as XT, Classic, and Unlimited over the past couple of years. More recently, many have been focused on the two clients; Core with Segregated Witness, and Unlimited with its block size cap removal. These subjects have caused a significant divide between many members of the community, because oftentimes change scares people. Alternative Bitcoin protocol creations have always produced a contentious air within the cryptocurrency community. Whether it be Libbitcoin, Btcd, bitcoinj, Unlimited, Classic, or XT, the many different reference implementations have been ferociously debated. Whether or not these changes are arguable, alternative clients exist and continue to be developed. It’s hard for some to swallow. This will not only continue to increase but also always be the case with open source software. Many believe it is important for alternative clients to flourish for Bitcoin to become a more robust open source model of decentralization, otherwise developers, miners, or outside interests may centralize the network. Furthermore, people are using these variations by testing whether or not they improve Bitcoin’s capabilities and evolution. The Libbitcoin Manifesto details why diversity is key to the protocol’s advancement:    Recently, Bitcoin.com reported on Bitcoin Unlimited gaining 17% of signaled support from mining pools. The topic has flared debate in the community because it shows that change is taking place within the network. One of the most beautiful aspects of Bitcoin is that anyone can contribute and make changes. Even though there is only a small group of people with access to making changes to the one client, it doesn’t mean alternative changes won’t happen elsewhere and subsequent adoption will not happen. Just as Bitcoin came into the world without asking permission the network, participants and developers don’t need permission either. “You’re missing the point of Bitcoin if you feel left out,” explains Bitcoin developer Gavin Andresen. “You can be as involved as you want to be, just go make something happen. Find something you think needs doing, recruit some people to help if you need help, and do it. Are you waiting for an invitation or permission from somebody?” The fact is because Bitcoin is open to anyone in more ways than one, there will always be changes and those who want to make things happen without permission, even in the code development realm. It will always be up to users, miners, wallet providers, and exchanges to choose what will be adopted. Nothing will ever remain static within the Bitcoin network just as mining changed from CPU to ASICs and the same will go for changes to the code. Change in the Bitcoin space is inevitable and it will likely always cause some to be uncomfortable. The Bitcoin community should approach these subjects in an amicable fashion rather than with extreme rancor because, like it or not, alternatives and different ideas are here to stay. People need to step back and remember that Satoshi didn’t give the source code to a small group of individuals, but instead he gave the protocol openly to the entire planet. The question is — How can the Bitcoin community of users, miners, and developers be more cooperative when it comes to open source changes? The bottom line is, changes will always remain a significant challenge within the Bitcoin network for the community to overcome.

This will be the second investment product for the company; the first was the Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT). Bitcoin.com caught up with Grayscale CEO and founder, Barry Silbert, to find out more about this new product. Also read: Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF ‘Very Low’  It has been over three years since Grayscale launched its first product, the BIT, on September 25, 2013, when the price of Bitcoin was roughly $127.7 and the market cap was only about $1.469 billion. Modeled on the SPDR® Gold Shares ETF, the Trust was created for investors looking for Bitcoin exposure. By the end of last year, it had $164.21 million in assets under management. The BIT has always been a private placement for accredited investors, trading over-the-counter. Now, the company, waiting to be listed on the NYSE Arca, has ceased all private offerings but continues to trade on OTCQX under the symbol GBTC. As the BIT begins its journey away from being a private vehicle for only accredited investors, Grayscale is introducing another private investment vehicle called the ‘Ethereum (ETC) Investment Trust‘ (EIT). It allows investors to gain exposure to the price movements of Ethereum Classic without actually owning any ETC. According to Silbert, the new product is modeled after the BIT. “It will be an open-ended trust that holds ETC,” he described. As such, the Trust can issue and redeem shares at any time. Regarding the decision to launch this new Trust, Silbert told Bitcoin.com: ETC is the newer of the two Ethereum cryptocurrencies resulting from the July 2016 hard fork of the Ethereum blockchain. It is “a continuation of the original Ethereum blockchain – the classic version preserving untampered history; free from external interference and subjective tampering of transactions,” its website describes. While ETC is the original protocol and has fewer modifications than the other Ethereum cryptocurrency (ETH), many of the developers and the community behind Ethereum have moved on to ETH. ETC now trades on several exchanges including Bitfinex and Poloniex. At press time, the cryptocurrency is trading at US$1.40, approximately half of its all-time-high price from immediately after the split, with a market cap of around $124.6 million. Silbert confirmed that the EIT “will be launched as a private vehicle open to accredited investor.” The Grayscale website now describes its new product just as it did with the BIT, stating that: The Securities Act of 1933 mandates all companies to register any securities with the SEC that they are offering or selling. However, there are some exemptions such as one provided by Regulation D (Reg D) which allows a company to sell its securities to accredited investors without registering with the Commission by filing Form D, ‘Notice of Exempt Offering of Securities’. There are many ways to qualify as an accredited investor. For example, anyone with a net worth exceeding $1 million or with an income of more than $200,000 in the two most recent years and reasonably expects the same for the current year, is qualified. While there is much to do before launching the EIT, Silbert said the company is “Planning to launch in Q1,” adding that they are “waiting for the monetary policy (supply cap) to get finalized.” What do you think of the ETC Trust?

By working with the Los Angeles-based Love My Neighbor Foundation, the organizations have collaborated to deliver socks to the homeless within the region. Also read: Over 300 BTC in High Stake Jackpots Available at Bitcoin Games The Dogecoin community has been well-known over the past few years for dedicating funds and efforts towards charity. The “Shibes For Socks” project is a new endeavor devoted to delivering socks to the homeless. The Bitcoin Store is the first sponsor of the new program assisting in helping the homeless obtain basic human necessities. Socks are considered an under-donated need for homeless, many of whom are constantly on their feet. The Shibes For Socks project aims to help provide new socks to the homeless regularly with the next delivery date this coming February. Dogecoin community member, u/phupas, explains the foundation of these types of charitable projects in which their community takes so much pride. “The strength of the Dogecoin community isn’t in numbers like bitcoin, but it’s the generosity of the members. While Dogecoin isn’t as large as other alt coins, we take pride in helping people in need.” The Bitcoin Store which sells cryptocurrency related products and apparel is proud to help this charitable effort promoted by the crypto-community. Stephen Macaskill, founder of The Bitcoin Store, explains: The Dogecoin community’s latest effort was initially designed to test dogecoinmultisig.org, a dedicated philanthropy and commerce platform. Hundreds of brand new pairs of socks were sent to the homeless on December 8, 2016 and January 12, 2017. Members of the r/dogecoin community believe their multi-signature process allows a superior form of security when it comes to humanitarian projects that hold funds. “The community has a long history of crowdfunded projects, and we’ve had some issues with how those funds have been handled,” explained u/peoplma, a Dogecoin community member. “Multisig has the ability to say, ‘These four people control this money, and three out of the four of them must agree on how it is spent in order to spend it’. So in a crowdfunding context, people who donate can be more confident that their money won’t be used improperly.”  The multi-signature tool was built to incorporate transactions with multiple individuals, and the team has also translated the tool’s instructions in multiple languages. The #DogecoinSocksForTheHomeless team say they have been utilizing the “Tripleshibe” multi-signature application for this specific project. Dogecoin community member u/tomcarbon hopes these types of charitable projects will show the public that good things can happen with these types of technology. “We are proud to show everyone how Dogecoin can help people by combining community with the will to make the world we share a better place,” u/tomcarbon detailed.

2017-01-22T13:30:14-04:00,Big Changes Coming Within the Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Realm,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/big-changes-chinese-bitcoin-exchanges/,"There’s a lot of changes happening with Chinese bitcoin exchanges lately in light of the recent central bank inspections. Last week the top three exchanges within the region drastically changed margin lending services. Now more revelations have come to light as these companies plan on charging their customers trading fees starting at the end of January. Also read: Samourai Wallet Launches New Privacy Feature Ricochet It seems after January 24, 2017, the top three Chinese bitcoin exchanges BTCC, OKcoin, and Huobi will be charging trading fees. The announcement comes after the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) began inspecting the exchanges and pledging new oversight. The most vocal company so far has been the BTCC exchange giving details to the public regularly.   “BTCChina, our CNY exchange, will start charging fees for bitcoin and litecoin trading from 12:00 PM (noon) UTC+8, Tuesday, January 24th,” explains BTCC during the recent trading fees announcement. “Market makers and takers will both be charged a flat fee of 0.2 percent per transaction. We are implementing fee-based trading to curb market manipulation and extreme volatility.” Many Bitcoin community members are wondering how these new policies will affect the Chinese trading market. The new rules have a stark contrast to the years when Chinese exchanges operated with no trading fees and significantly sized margin lending practices. While BTCC’s newly implemented fees are pretty low, a lot of people are welcoming these new changes to the Chinese Bitcoin markets. One commenter on Reddit declares, “We are now witnessing a historic moment in Bitcoin, the end of the China casino era.”  Throughout the years China has dominated the trading market with vast volumes, but many questioned the numbers due to the exchanges lack of fees. With the new changes towards margin lending, and applying fees to trades, it may put China in a different position. Other countries are slowly rising to become the top dogs within the Bitcoin space. For instance, Japanese trading volumes have exploded over the past few months as the country is now second in Bitcoin trading volume below China. Japan has focused steadily on capturing the Bitcoin and blockchain ecosystem and has definitely made its presence known over the past year. Companies like Bitflyer have positioned themselves as leading Bitcoin exchanges. Now the leading Japanese Internet company, GMO Internet Group is joining the Bitcoin exchange and wallet arena. China has gained a noteworthy head start when it comes to the digital currency and blockchain industry. The country has dominated in transaction volume, trading volumes, mining pools, and the manufacturing of mining equipment.  Just one Chinese exchange has the lion’s share of the world’s Bitcoin trading volume compared to most global exchanges. However, some would tell you not to pay too much attention to Chinese trading volume as BTCC founder Bobby Lee once stated:  It’s safe to say it will take some time before a serious contender comes into play. But it doesn’t mean China will dominate forever. What do you think about the recent Chinese Bitcoin exchanges’ policy changes? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-22T12:00:06-04:00,QE and Capital Controls Create Worldwide Demand for Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/qe-and-capital-controls-create-worldwide-demand-for-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin had an incredible run in 2016, finally breaking $1,000 USD on New Year’s Day 2017. Many people are curious to find out why significant amounts of money found its way into the bitcoin economy over the past year. Two of the biggest reasons that are spurring bitcoin demand worldwide are bitcoin’s censorship resistance and it’s store of value attributes. The global economy is going through significant changes and tumultuous times. Because traditional markets are failing globally, people have been searching for a financial escape and economic safe haven. Bitcoin has filled the role of currency and store of value that is helping people worldwide. These needs have attributed to the exponential demand bitcoin has seen over the past year. Also read: Bitcoin’s Quirky Genesis Block Turns Eight Years Old One notable aspect of the troubled global economy is the use of capital controls by individual countries. Capital controls are residency-based policies concerning the in-and-outflows of legal tender from capital markets. Many of these rules are applied to currency exchanges that limit the amount of wealth that can leave the country. Lately, certain countries have increased capital controls to try and save the country’s failing economy and devalued currencies. China, home to a large amount of participants within the bitcoin community, has tightened capital controls. On December 30, 2016, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) imposed two new policies on capital outflow. The central bank now requires Chinese citizens and organizations to report all yuan transactions above 50,000 yuan (US$7,200). Furthermore, China’s State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) detailed that Chinese residents must also apply to SAFE’s committee before registering with a foreign currency exchange. Capital controls limit people’s abilities to transfer wealth as they please. This has highlighted bitcoin’s censorship resistance. Over the past two years, the strictest capital control policies come from countries such as China, Mumbai, Cyprus, India, Russia, and Argentina. Curiously enough these countries’ citizens have been heavily involved in the bitcoin economy over the past two years. Localbitcoins’ volumes in such economies has seen all-time highs, showing significant bitcoin demand stemming from geopolitical monetary controls. Globally, bitcoin is being discussed as a recognized store of value and hedge against turbulent markets. News reports and many headlines over the past year have defined the digital asset as an economic safe haven. The reason for this is because bitcoin has increased in value significantly in contrast to every fiat currency worldwide. The devaluation of legal tender in certain countries has also showcased bitcoin’s ability to be a digital store of wealth. The ongoing quantitative easing (“QE”) orchestrated by governments and central bankers in the US and the EU is another powerful driving force for the demand of bitcoin worldwide, as more and more people start to understand how QE devalues their own holdings. Currency devaluation is slightly different than depreciation because it is an economic policy that officially lowers the value of the country’s fiat value across global exchange rates. A monetary authority imposes these fixed rates by referencing the value of a foreign currency. Currently the most devalued currencies across the globe are the Vietnamese Dong, the Chinese Renminbi, the Venezuelan Bolivar, and the British Pound. Of course as you may have guessed all of these countries have intensified bitcoin demand. Devaluation makes people’s purchasing power less useful when using their country’s legal tender. It makes inflation grow and goods become more expensive. Because bitcoin has been a significant store of value nearly every year except for 2014 its popularity has increased quite a bit. Bitcoin has allowed global citizens to actually save money and see their purchasing power accrue remarkably. Bitcoin has a lot of benefits to why it’s useful but most likely the biggest reason is because it helps people escape monetary losses imposed by central authorities. It’s safe to assume that these financial restrictions will grow throughout many countries worldwide. This means bitcoin’s censorship resistant uses and its potential to remain a store of value will continue to entice many people. Bitcoin was born as an alternative to the central edicts of those trying to control the world’s wealth. As countries tighten their grips on their citizens, more people will try to escape the clutches of totalitarian financial regimes. If citizens catch wind of the benefits decentralized digital assets offer, the obvious choice will be bitcoin.

2017-01-21T19:00:06-04:00,Making ‘EthereRum’ Distilled by a Bitcoin Miner,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/south-florida-distillers-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin mining could have an unexpected application in the booming spirits industry. Shortcuts to aging rum and whiskey are sought after, and experiments have included dumping oak chips into whiskey barrels, and artificially heating and cooling barrels to imitate the passing of seasons. Also Read: Bitcoin Mining Power Growing Bigger But Greener  Electrical and computer engineering graduate of Cornell, Avi Aisenberg, describes himself as a hardware guy. These days, he’s running his company South Florida Distillers in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, making rum from locally sourced molasses.  As I speak with him by telephone, he’s in his warehouse with plans of attending the North American Bitcoin Conference the following day. He’s followed bitcoin since 2009, but only recently took the tumble down the rabbit hole by purchasing mining equipment. “I had difficulty digesting the notion that I could buy something like a Bitmain Antminer or Canaan Avalon, burn the electricity off 24/7, and get paid for it,” Mr. Aisenberg tells bitcoin.com. He ultimately purchased three Antminers and placed them in his distillery. “The last thing I thought I needed was for my warehouse to get any hotter,” Mr. Aisenberg said. “With the three antminers connected, approximately 4000 W of heat was now continuously being dumped into the air.” The spirits distiller hit on the idea to use the exhaust heat to cycle the temperature of his rum barrels to help accelerate the aging process. Heating and cooling the wooden barrels not only affects the temperature of the rum, but it causes the barrels to expand and contract. While this occurs, rum is forced back and forth through the charred inner surface of the barrel, helping filter the tastes and extracting the sugars and flavors from the wood. The idea of spoofing temperature cycles is not new to the spirits industry. Bryan Davis, founder of Los Angeles distillery Lost Spirits, helped to pioneer accelerated aging using temperature variations, among other adjustments, directly on spirit holding tanks and without wooden barrels.  Large spirits producers have even placed heating units or routed chiller heat exhaust into their rickhouses (where barrels are stored) to temperature cycle the room. Without bitcoin mining, Mr. Aisenberg views such approaches as a waste of heat.  After about two months of mining, Mr. Aisenberg decided to post a picture on Reddit to gauge the community’s reaction and was positively surprised by the response. “Why not take it one step further?” he thought. Mr. Aisenberg then focused on the distillation process itself. Distillation is the action of purifying a liquid through a heating and cooling process. For rum, distillers typically heat a boiler of fermented molasses with steam or electric causing the ethanol vapors to evaporate around 173 F, while the water in the solution does not boil off until 212 F. This difference in boiling points allows for the separation. The vapors are then passed through a condenser and out pours a steady stream of rum. “If I am heating my still with resistive electric heating already, why not pass those same electrons through my ASIC bitcoin miners first?” Mr. Aisenberg pondered. There was only one problem. The heat off the miners only measured between 130 to 140 F – not enough to drive the process. “Introduce a vacuum and you can drop the boiling point of ethanol to 130 to 140 degrees no problem,” says Mr. Aisenberg. “I’ve set up a table top vacuum still with the boiler submerged in a bath of water. The bath acts as heat capacitor to smooth out the varying heat levels off the miner. Once the ethanol starts to boil off, the remainder of the distillation process is the same.”    For now, he is using just three Antminers and has had successful results on a small scale. Mr. Aisenberg claims that he is working on scaling the process to larger volumes but will need an ASIC hardware partner to help realize his design. South Florida Distillers now plans to release the first ever rum distilled via bitcoin mining heat. It will be called EthereRum thanks to the suggestion of Redditor ‘Lazilox.’ “I now believe there are endless industrial heat applications that could benefit from bitcoin mining besides warming up rooms,” Mr. Aisenberg concludes. What weird mining experiments have you tried? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Reddit, South Florida Distillers, Avi Aisenberg.

2017-01-21T12:00:34-04:00,Bitcoin Investment Trust Could IPO by October,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-investment-trust-ipo-october/,"Bitcoin Investment Trust (BIT) wants to be listed on NYSE Arca, according to a registration statement filed Friday with the U.S Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). This is the second proposed Bitcoin investment trust listing on the exchange. The first, Solidx Bitcoin Trust, has yet to be approved by the SEC. Using Solidx as a model, it could take the Commission until October to make a decision whether to approve or disapprove BIT’s listing. Also read: SEC Delays Decision on SolidX Bitcoin Trust  As Donald Trump prepared to be inaugurated as the 45th President of the United States on January 20, Barry Silbert filed a registration statement with the SEC seeking an initial public offering (IPO) for his flagship fund BIT. BIT’s shares are to be listed under the symbol GBTC on the NYSE Arca. “This is an initial public offering of the Trust’s Shares,” BIT’s registration statement reads. The shares “are designed to provide investors with a cost-effective and convenient way to invest in Bitcoin.” Grayscale Investments, LLC is the sponsor of the Trust, Delaware Trust Company is the trustee, the Bank of New York Mellon is the transfer agent, as well as the administrator, and Xapo Inc. is the custodian. The annual fee for investors will remain at 2 percent. The proposed maximum offering is $500 million of the Trust’s shares. Silbert’s Grayscale Investments, LLC simultaneously announced that it “has ceased its ongoing private placement and will no longer issue shares of the Bitcoin Investment Trust through its previous 506(c) private placement.” However, BIT’s shares will continue to be quoted in the secondary market over-the-counter on OTCQX under the symbol GBTC while the registration with the SEC is pending approval. GBTC currently has assets under management of $164.21 million as of the end of December 2016. A possible time frame for the SEC to either approve or disapprove BIT’s listing on the NYSE Arca can be estimated using Solidx Bitcoin Trust as an example. Solidx originally filed with the Commission to list on the NYSE Arca on July 11, 2016. After the company’s initial filing, the next step will be for the exchange to file with the SEC “a proposed rule change to list and trade shares” under NYSE Arca Equities Rule 8.201. For Solidx, the NYSE Arca filed with the SEC on July 13, 2016, which was two days after Solidx filed. Given that BIT’s filing was on a Friday, the NYSE Arca could file with the SEC early next week. Then the proposed rule change would be published for comments in the Federal Register. This usually happens between two to three weeks after a filing with the SEC. For Solidx, it was published on August 2, 2016, approximately three weeks after filing. That means the proposed rule change for BIT should be published in the Federal Register sometime in the second or third week of February. After publishing in the Federal Register, the Commission has 180 days to issue an order approving or disapproving the proposed rule change. However, it can also extend that period by a maximum of 60 days if necessary, which is a total of 240 days from the publication in the Federal Register. For Solidx, the SEC has already chosen to extend the consideration period as long as it could to March 30, 2017. For BIT, 180 days from a likely date of publication in the Federal Register would be early August and 60 days after that would be early October. The SEC has a habit of delaying making decisions on Bitcoin investment funds as seen by the delay for Solidx, taking the maximum time allowed by the Securities Exchange Act. Recently, Needham & Company, which provides investment coverage of BIT, suggested that the chance of the SEC approving Bitcoin ETFs is very low, at less than 25 percent. According to Needham, there is no more extension available for the Commission after the 60 days. The firm also suggested that the Commission may not make a decision by the deadline, in which case “the proposed rule change is automatically approved,” Needham’s report reads. The firm believes this will increase the likelihood of an ETF being approved. Then, there’s the ‘Trump factor.’ The new administration may be more Bitcoin friendly than the previous administration. “We need to undo many regulations which have stifled investment in American businesses, and restore oversight of the financial industry in a way that does not harm American workers,” President Trump recently said.

However, Bitcoin interest in the country remains strong despite the government’s efforts there. Also read: Nigerian SEC Associates Shady MLM Schemes Like Onecoin With Bitcoin  Last week, the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued a circular to banks and other financial institutions requiring them to take certain actions relating to digital currencies. Citing money laundering and terrorism financing, the CBN requires banks to “ensure that you do not use, hold, trade and/or transact in anyway” in digital currencies. Banks also must ensure that their digital currency exchange customers “have effective AML/CFT controls” to allow them to comply with customer identification, verification and transaction monitoring requirements. If in doubt, the relationship with those exchanges and customers should be discontinued immediately. Specifically naming “Bitcoin, Ripples, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecoin, Onecoin,” and similar products, the Bank reiterates that they are not legal tender in Nigeria. On the same day, the Nigerian Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also made its own announcement regarding digital currencies. The SEC warned the public against investing in them, specifically naming bitcoin alongside Swisscoin and Onecoin, on which Bitcoin.com recently reported. “The public is hereby advised to exercise extreme caution with regard to digital (cryptocurrencies) as a vehicle of investments,” the SEC Nigeria announced. Meanwhile, Bitcoin’s interest has been growing in Nigeria, as shown in the increase in the number of online bitcoin-related searches, rising from almost non-existent to the country with the most searches for the word bitcoin in the entire world. The U.S. in comparison ranks 21st with only 13 percent search volume compared to Nigeria within a 12-month period, according to Google Trends. From January 12th, when the CBN and the SEC made their announcements, Bitcoin’s interest in terms of online searches trended down. Nigeria still remains the number one country for bitcoin-related searches. While some search terms are related to the MMM bitcoin scheme, most search terms are bitcoin-specific interest such as ‘create bitcoin wallet’, ‘bitcoin to naira’ and ‘bitcoin to dollar,’ as well as various bitcoin exchanges and Localbitcoins.  Even if the government eventually bans bitcoin, there is evidence from other countries that interest could end up spiking after such a ban, as shown in the case of Bangladesh and Bolivia. Both countries banned bitcoin in 2014. By 2016, bitcoin interest had skyrocketed, according to Google Trends. Meanwhile, Nigeria’s inflation rate has been increasing sharply to over 18 percent and forecasted to rise higher according to Tradingeconomics. The trend could also have contributed to rising bitcoin’s interest in the country.  While there is certainly interest, “Adoption is still small compared to some other markets, but it’s definitely growing fast,” Marcus Swanepoel, CEO of the largest bitcoin exchange in Nigeria, Luno, told Bitcoin.com. According to Coinhills, daily trading volume on Luno, formerly BitX, was 224 bitcoin and 117 on Localbitcoins at press time, placing Naira the 16th most traded currencies for bitcoin. “People appear to be using it for the same things they use it in other countries, including simply buying it as an alternative store of wealth or to hedge against local currency fluctuations, which is something that we’ve seen happen a lot in emerging markets,” Swanepoel noted. In the near future, Swanepoel does not believe that bitcoin will become the dominant mobile money in Nigeria. “It’s way too volatile and there is still a lot of regulatory uncertainty around it, people still need to be able to access and learn about it easier. We are working on solving all of those problems but it will take some time,” he said. Do you think Nigeria’s Bitcoin interest will continue to rise? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-01-21T01:00:24-04:00,‘Covenants’ Mean You Can Burn Stolen Bitcoins,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/covenant-wallet-burn-stolen-bitcoin/,"Cornell computer science professor Emin Gün Sirer thinks a bitcoin wallet model called ‘Covenants’ would disincentivize hackers by allowing the victim to ‘burn’ the compromised bitcoin after the hack; that is, destroy the bitcoin.  Also Read: How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet for Your Needs  Because bitcoin transactions are final, there is a major bug bounty on bitcoin wallets. This has led to high profile hacks of exchanges, wallet services and individual users.  “People compromise a system, find a bitcoin key, then steal the funds,” Dr. Sirer explains. “There’s no recourse. As soon as they get the funds, there is no filing a claim that you’re the rightful owner, as the rightful owner is ‘he who has the key.’”  The Cornell professor suggests modern computer systems remain “nowhere near” secure enough to hold high value digital assets, like bitcoin.  “We need to deal with the fact that bitcoin keys are going to be stolen and we want to be able to somehow stem this,” Dr. Sirer says.   In the best case scenario, once your ‘covenant’ has been hacked, then you go to a new machine and use the master key as a recovery key. The worst case scenario, which may end in burning the coins, is when you’ve lost both your regular key and master key to the hacker.  “If all keys are compromised, there’s no way to recover your coins,” Dr. Sirer says. “But, the covenant vault construction allows you to burn the coins. You cannot get them back, you cannot prove they are yours, but at least you can disallow the hacker from getting away with it.” Suddenly, the hacker’s expected gain is zero.  “Even if he gets your master key, you can burn your coins,” Dr. Sirer notes. “There is no point into hacking the system in the first place. The second masterkey takes away the motivation of the hacker to compromise bitcoin hosts.”  The Bitcoin development community has hitherto seen the issue as a hardware and software issue. “After so many decades of computer science, general security hardening might not happen,” Dr. Sirer said. “While operating systems improve, they grow more complex, and this creates a constant stream of compromises.”  Covenants are a “construction” that functions as a “special box” in which a bitcoin holder could store digital currency. “Only you can open that box, which has two keys in the simplest scenario,” Dr. Sirer describes. “You place the coins into the special box and use the regular key to unlock it and take the coin out to use. There is a second key, then, to spend. If someone steals the first key, starts imitating you, the second key can be used to signal the hacker is not the real you since you have the master key, which overrides the regular key. You can take the money back with the master key, as well.”  Covenants do not affect bitcoin fungibility. “Bitcoin payments are as final as they ever were, since only payments from the box to yourself can be reversed,” Dr. Sirer assures. “Covenant deploying wallets simply have the ability to vault their coin, and vaulting entails an extra layer of protection.”   Covenants use recursive constraints, a new technique in securing bitcoins and cryptocurrencies. “They are essentially a restriction on how coins can be used when you vault the bitcoin,” the Cornell professor explains. “You are doing the same thing you do with bitcoin, but attaching a little rider which says ‘this money is mine, and for the allotted amount of time it can be recovered with the ‘masterkey.’” This, in essence, is a covenant.  “Hackers cannot get rid of the covenant,” Dr. Sirer clarifies. “They are inherited, and no matter if the hacker tries to mix the coins, he can’t rid of the recursive nature of the covenant. With covenant, holders can kill the hacker’s satisfaction of having stolen the bitcoins.”  There were more than 26 bitcoins reported ‘burned’ in 2016. “Lost coins only make everyone else’s coins worth slightly more,” Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto wrote on the forum BitcoinTalk in the digital currency’s incipience. “Think of it as a slight donation to everyone.”  Mr. Sirer agrees. “It’s akin to a social donation,” he says. “You’re increasing the value of everyone’s bitcoins. In the very worst case scenario, bitcoins which would have remained in circulation, but belonged to a hacker, are now out of circulation.” He concludes: “They’ve remained your bitcoin until the end. You simply chose to kill your bitcoins.” Continue the conversation in the comments!

2017-01-20T21:00:50-04:00,A Cannabis Industry Icon Accepts Bitcoin,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/jerome-baker-designs-bitcoin/,"Earlier this week, a bill was introduced in Washington state to ban pot shops from accepting bitcoins. Some of the biggest names in cannabis, however, have already dipped their toes into the digital currency market. One of the most storied functional glass makers in the history of glass (he’s done works for the Dalai Lama and Snoop Dogg) accepts bitcoins and offers a steep discount to those who pay in the digital currency. “Jerome Baker himself (Jason Harris) will make you a beautiful hand made glass Bubbler – old school style – for one BITCOIN,” reads the Jerome Baker Designs (JBD) website. Also Read: Colorado Cannabis Operations Begin Banking with Bitcoin  By sending bitcoins to the company’s public Bitcoin address, and confirming a shipping address via email, bitcoiners can make the so-called ‘Slyme Bubbler’ their own. Jason Harris, the founder of Jerome Baker Designs, started blowing glass in 1991. The seventh disciple of legendary functional glass blower Bob Snodgrass, Mr. Harris was part of Eugene’s bustling glass scene of the nineties, and also seventh generation glass blower Hans Ittig from Wertheim, Germany “I don’t make custom glass,” Mr. Harris, who has been interested in Bitcoin for about four years, told Bitcoin.com. “If I do, it starts at $10,000. I don’t like doing them, but I will do one for a bitcoin. I won’t do it for cash, I will only do it for Bitcoin. My objective was to mine bitcoins out of humans, because I believe in Bitcoin. Well, I make glass art. I make something special that might draw people in.” There are various examples of businesses giving discounts for Bitcoin. Purse.io offers consumers discounts at Amazon. Gyft offers 3% back on gift cards for bitcoins. Fold saves people 20% at Starbucks. Vapeboy offers 5% off vape liquids, including their Satoshi Nakamoto flavor. While he lived in Oregon, the DEA arrested Mr. Harris as part of Operation Pipe Dreams and Operation Headhunter. Tommy Chong served time for his functional glass products as a result of the operation. By the time of his arrest, which some content was merely for being a symbol of US cannabis culture, Mr. Harris had a functional glass empire and was known worldwide. The federal government labelled the operation an illicit enterprise and seized company assets. Mr. Harris, a founding member of the Eugene Glass School in Eugene, Oregon was indicted alongside 50 individuals on charges of trafficking in illegal drug paraphernalia. According to authorities, he had partly succeeded because of the internet. Attorney General John Ashcroft stated at the time: “With the advent of the Internet, the illegal drug paraphernalia industry has exploded. The drug paraphernalia business is now accessible in anyone’s home with a computer and Internet access. And in homes across America we know that children and young adults are the fastest growing Internet users. Quite simply, the illegal drug paraphernalia industry has invaded the homes of families across the country without their knowledge…Today, the Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force…has taken decisive steps to dismantle the illegal drug paraphernalia industry by attacking their physical, financial and Internet infrastructures.” Mr. Harris laid low thereafter and turned the JBD brand into a skateboarding-focused lifestyle brand. After moving to Maui to soak up the sun and ride the waves, he focused on non-functional glass, making high end installations for exclusive clientele as Maui Glass Blowing. With marijuana legalized either medicinally or recreationally in 35 states and Washington, D.C., Mr. Harris’ functional talents are enjoying renewed demand. He recently designed a $18,000 nug jug for entertainer Snoop Dogg. Like the internet helped Mr. Baker build his business empire of the nineties and early oughts, many say Bitcoin could become a tool to help cannabis industry payments. “I feel like Bitcoin is a great a currency for this quote and unquote gray market area,” said the artist, whose main interest is how the Bitcoin algorithm and protocol works. “The currency lends itself nicely to this particular industry. It’s a biblical algorithm that changed humanity and will change humanity on a much more powerful level.” What do you think about the merging of cannabis and Bitcoin?

2017-01-20T12:00:28-04:00,Needham: Banning Does Not Prevent Bitcoin Adoption,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/needham-banning-not-prevent-bitcoin-adoption/,"Needham & Company LLC, released a note for investors Thursday on the ‘Economic and Financial Turmoil Driving Bitcoin Interest & Adoption’. The note discusses various indicators the firm believes would propel increased bitcoin adoption going forward, such as capital controls, demonetization, hyperinflation as well as bitcoin bans. Some factors may seem negative at first but Needham believes they ultimately drive bitcoin interest and adoption. Also read: Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF ‘Very Low’  The company is a nationally recognized investment banking and asset management firm focused solely on growth companies. Since its inception, it has acted as lead or co-manager in over 785 public offerings. Needham analyst and author Spencer Bogart explained that some countries will inevitably ban or place onerous regulation on Bitcoin. “While these actions certainly don’t benefit Bitcoin adoption, they typically don’t prevent it either,” he noted, adding that: Citing Bangladesh as an example, Bogart referenced the Central Bank’s bitcoin ban in September 2014 which imposed 12 years of jail time for offenders. Using bitcoin’s share of internet search queries as a proxy for interest in bitcoin, he said in 2016, the country subsequently became number seven globally with the highest bitcoin interest. “Interestingly, the top rising related topics and queries all appear geared toward genuine usage (searches for popular wallets, conversion rates, etc) as opposed to activity related to scams/Ponzi schemes or regulatory news,” he added. Likewise, Bolivia, which banned bitcoin in mid-2014, also saw a spike in bitcoin interest and ranks number eight overall for relevant search terms.  The phenomenon Bogart describes for search interest in countries where bitcoin has been outlawed is well explained by the Streisand effect, which states that censorship often has unintended consequences, and those who are censored from information will be likely to seek it out even more vigorously than before. Some other factors driving bitcoin adoption discussed in the note are capital controls, demonetization, and hyperinflation across several countries which Bogart claimed are propelling bitcoin’s rising interest and adoption worldwide. For example, India banned large bills last November and bitcoin’s interest, based on internet search volume and well as trading volume, surged and bitcoin usage has tripled since the ban, Bogart explained. In Nigeria, the rate of inflation has nearly doubled over the past year to 19% which is accompanied by “a rapid increase in search interest for Bitcoin within the country,” he said, adding that in Venezuela the hyperinflation (180%+) problem has been plaguing the economy and it is “driving a surge in Bitcoin interest and trading volume.” Overall, he concluded that: While some countries have opted to ban bitcoin, there are others that have embraced it, which Bogart acknowledged in his note. For example, Switzerland has added the ability to buy bitcoin at any of the National Swiss Railway ticket kiosks, of which there are over a thousand spread around the country. Paying utilities with bitcoin is also possible in the Swiss town Zug. In addition, the country is also reportedly developing a potential licensing of “crypto-banks” which would “create a new category of financial institutions that are able to handle cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin,” Bogart described. The note also revealed the United States trails 20 other countries in bitcoin interest as revealed by bitcoin’s share of internet search queries. “While much of the initial venture activity and interest in bitcoin came from within the United States, international interest has surged,” the note reads. Caracas (Venezuela), Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), Sandton (South Africa), and Lagos (Nigeria) all exceed the interest from San Francisco and New York, the note revealed.

Moreover, attendees also met with developers and saw demos from the wallet company Airbitz. Other exhibits included the Ledger team displaying their products and selling the Nano S hardware wallet at a conference discount. Bitcoin ATM manufacturers General Bytes had a working display model on the showcase floor and also showed a preview of the company’s NFC card models. Another ATM company in attendance was Athena Bitcoin who operates two machines in the Miami area and also maintains the exchange Bitquick. Guests also saw the host of Austin-based radio broadcast The Crypto Show, an Otika.tv broadcast from Tone VaysÂ and the World Crypto Network attended virtually. The morning talks and exhibits ended with MGT Capitalâs John McAfee. Many bitcoiners were excited to hear the former U.S. presidential candidate and antivirus tycoonâs views concerning bitcoin security. McAfee detailed how easy it is to compromise mobile phones and how bitcoin users should take better precautions than using their phones to store cryptocurrencies. McAfee explained how he would purposely interact with shady pop-ups affecting his mobile browser just to see what malicious hackers were doing. The MGT Capital founder said he had lost thousands of dollars between four wallets just by interacting with these pop-ups. Hackers are using multiple types of keylogging techniques, and screen captures to compromise mobile phones explained McAfee. The Bitcoin community needs to get serious and put security at the forefront, said McAfee, before hackers clean sweep thousands of people’s phones. Many TNABC attendees seemed a bit shook from McAfeeâs talk, and some wondered if he had a solution to the problem. Afternoon presentations included a talk by Dean Masley of the Blockchain Education Network detailing how the group was educating college students across the world about bitcoin. One notable happening that afternoon included Masley and his Unsung co-founder Jason King prepping food to feed Miamiâs hungry. The Unsung team, with the help of The Crypto Showâs host, delivered meals during the event in Miamiâs inner city district. The rest of the conference included a compelling discussion about technological disruptors from Tally Capitalâs Andrew Filipowski. Charlie Shrem explained his new venture and how the ICO environment was changing for the better. Other notable speakers that ended the day included Thomas France of Ledger Wallet, Brock Pierce of Blockchain Capital, Paul Puey of Airbitz, and Justin Newton of Netki. The conference was a giant success as many guests explained they were very happy to attend the Miami event. Furthermore, Bitcoin.com let the hosts of Bitcoin Uncensored use our exhibition booth to broadcast which was far cleaner than the men’s restroom.  The Bitcoin community is growing larger by the minute, and conferences like these are educating people about the many benefits of decentralized protocols. “One of the big aims of this conference was to help set the direction for Bitcoinâs near future, and I canât imagine a better group of people to enable that,”Â TNABC event organizer Moe LevinÂ told Bitcoin.com. He summarized: “With their help, I think weâve made some headway this weekend in defining the largest teething points that are inhibiting growth and made some steps toward overcoming these with new technologies and a more unified approach. Even if no concrete steps have been made, I know for a fact that many new connections have been made, that many new ideas have been forged, and that the work that was done here this weekend will come to fruition in the very near future.” Images courtesy of TNABC, and Jamie RedmanÂ  Can you remember your first-ever bitcoin purchase?

2017-01-20T01:00:15-04:00,Bitcoin is Tapping Into the Laws of Nature. Part 3.,Mike White,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-tapping-laws-nature-part-3/,"Over Part 1 and Part 2 of this series we have come a long way to proving how disconnected the legacy financial system is to natural law. We have also seen how perfectly aligned bitcoin works with nature’s frameworks. Now let’s drive the point home by looking at two more fundamental laws of nature. If a squirrel doesn’t collect enough nuts before through winter he will go hungry or even starve. A farmer can’t dig up next year’s harvest now. The squirrel and farmer alike must devote time and energy before receiving the rewards. In nature, you reap what you sow, but you must sow first. Value must be created before it is spent. This is the essence of a value based system. This is not to say that loans are bad at all but just that the origin of the loans should be value that was earned not created out of this air. Bitcoin is a value based system. Bitcoin miners must devote time and energy into the network in order to have a chance of obtaining new bitcoins. No new bitcoins are promised ahead of time. Just like gold’s value is proportional to the time and energy it takes to dig it out of the ground, the presence of a bitcoin is proof that time and energy has been spent in creating it. The United States financial system used to be value based. Pre-1971 the US system was on the “gold standard.” This meant that all the money was backed by gold sitting somewhere in a vault. Every dollar was redeemable for a certain amount of gold or silver. But just like every government in history, eventually the US wanted something for nothing. They went off the gold standard and started issuing money that was nothing more than a ledger entry backed by a promise to pay. See also: Bitcoin is Tapping into the Laws of Nature Part 1 The money in fiat systems around the world (like the USD) requires no more time and energy to create than it does to enter a number into a database. The fact is that nowhere in nature can you reap rewards without doing the work. This leads us to the most unbreakable of nature’s laws…mathematics. No set of laws are as unbreakable as those found in mathematics. Maths is indeed the language of the universe. We can’t have a popular vote to change the fact that 2 + 2 = 4. However, voters in Switzerland recently voted on a universal basic income (free money). While bitcoin is not regulated by any government or corporation, it is still regulated. It is regulated by maths. Mathematics regulates how and when bitcoin is created, stored and spent. We know what the inflation rate of bitcoin will be 100 years from now. On the other hand, fiat currencies are governed by imperfect people. Countless hours and billions of dollars are spent every month trying to second guess the interest rate movements by central banks around the world. Imagine if these resources were put towards something that actually added value. Also, government printing money in the form of bail outs, quantitative easing, helicopter money or what ever you want to call it, is an attempt to make something out of nothing. People cannot make 0 + 0 = 2. From the fall of the Roman Empire to the “too big to fail” bail outs in 2008, the history of money is the history of those in power failing their people. Regardless of your political view, which do you trust more… politicians or mathematics? Let us have a look at the table.   I mentioned in Part 1 of this series that this would be a tip of the iceberg discussion. Hopefully, it now makes sense to judge our current systems a little more critically. However, it is incorrect to say that current financial systems are not natural. They are as much from nature as we are. They just have a history of being ineffective and go against the blueprints of effective systems the universe has repeatedly shown us. Any seasoned sailor would advise that it is foolish go against mother nature. It would be wise if we paid attention to the wisdom that surrounds us. Bitcoin is tapping into that wisdom and leading us to uncharted territory with limitless possibilities. If you liked the article please share it and let me know.

2017-01-19T12:00:12-04:00,Pakistan Set to Become a Major Bitcoin Hub,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/pakistan-set-to-become-a-major-bitcoin-hub/,"Pakistan is currently the seventh most populous country in the world with approximately 202 million residents. Today, the country exhibits many traits ripe for accelerated bitcoin adoption. Bitcoin.com discussed bitcoin trends in Pakistan with Danyal Manzar, the co-founder of Pakistan’s first and largest bitcoin trading platform, Urdubit. Also read: Polish Bitcoin Adoption Escalating with Strong Ecosystem  Despite having no access to Paypal, Pakistan still ranks among the top countries for freelance outsource workers. In fact, “Pakistan is ranked 3rd on freelance websites,” Manzar told Bitcoin.com. According to the New York Times, 10,000 IT graduates in Pakistan are estimated to enter the Pakistan job market every year. Remittances are also a “very big market” in Pakistan, Manzar described. “We see about 20 billion USD coming in annually,” he said of his country. “Since there are not enough jobs, the major remittance is seen from the UAE and Saudi Arabia followed by western countries.” Despite the lack of jobs, however, life in Pakistan has been modernizing in recent years. Rapid lifestyle change, technological innovations, and increasing broadband access in Pakistan have all accelerated the number of Pakistani freelancers. However, “the payments are always a problem,” Manzar said, adding that: Mobile broadband use is growing very fast in the country. The World Bank describes Pakistan as “leading the way in South Asia in digital finance” with 6% of adults having mobile accounts, compared to South Asia’s average of less than 2.6%. Last June, the number of 3G/4G subscribers in the country had reached 29.53 million, up from 14.6 million in July 2015. Total broadband subscribers grew 92% to 32.41 million from 16.88 million, according to the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA). The World Bank also notes that about 100 million adults in Pakistan are unbanked, without access to formal and regulated financial services. Only 13 percent of adults there have a formal account and 27.5 million adults said the distance to a financial institution is a barrier to opening a financial account. With so many unbanked, no access to Paypal, a huge freelancing industry, a major remittance destination, and so many subscribed to a high-speed mobile account, Bitcoin could find a huge home market in Pakistan. Admittedly, the bitcoin market in Pakistan “is still very new,” but it is fast growing, Manzar said. Citing low banking penetration and “very limited POS terminals in the country,” he explained: Manzar’s Urdubit is a real-time bitcoin exchange using the blinktrade engine. According to Coinhills, Urdubit’s trading volume has been growing steadily in the last few weeks, and the exchange has the largest bitcoin trading volume in the country, twice that of Localbitcoins in a 24-hour period. “I would say our market share is 1/3 of the total market,” he explained. If he’s correct, that indicates Pakistan trades around 40 bitcoins each day, putting it somewhere around 27th place among all currencies in volume rankings. However, he also admitted that there are still not many shops accepting bitcoin. Online, the situation is a bit better, since many websites in the country have started accepting bitcoin as a payment “due to quicker payment times and no charge backs.” Manzar noted: Meanwhile, the Pakistan government “hasn’t taken any stance on bitcoin as of yet,” Manzar added. His company has been approved by the State Bank Of Pakistan. “They believe that bitcoin is a commodity and not a currency,” he noted. Do you think Pakistan is ripe for bitcoin adoption?

2017-01-19T04:30:51-04:00,Network Alternative Bitcoin Unlimited Closing In On ‘Opponent’ Segwit Proposal,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/network-alternative-bitcoin-unlimited-closing-in-on-opponent-segwit-proposal/,"The number of blocks mined using the alternative Bitcoin client, Bitcoin Unlimited (BU), is increasing. Over the past weeks and months BU, also known as BUIP 001, has seemingly been increasingly adopted by Bitcoin participants.  Bitcoin Core, the most-run Bitcoin mining client, still mines 600 more blocks per 1,000 than BU and remains for now as Bitcoin’s “main” consensus client. Also Read: Interview with Bitcoin Unlimited Developer Andrew Stone The “quiet” adoption, which has seen BU go from 0 blocks to 200 blocks per 1000 in less than six months, could signal a changing of the guard of sorts in terms of which development pools have gained the trust of the ‘Bitcoin Community’ (especially from the miners securing the network). It’s a result of the so called Bitcoin ‘block size debate’, as new solutions for Bitcoin malleability and block size are imagined by new names. If you are new to Bitcoin these are highly technical and difficult subjects to fathom, and many high-strung debates rage continuously in online forums on the matter. Mining pools ViaBTC, India’s GBMiners and Bitcoin.com are examples of pools mining with BU, and comprise currently altogether approx. 13% of the Bitcoin network, bringing the total signaled support for BU up to approx. 17%. In the meanwhile, the development teams behind Bitcoin Classic (another such protocol “upgrade” proposal) and Bitcoin Unlimited have all but merged, and each actively endorse the close relationship between the projects. Also Read: Added Support For BU as Pools Show Preference for Different Scalability Solutions A new, ‘mysterious’ mining pool, located at the domain address BTC.Top and going by the moniker “Leite BTC Mining”, adopted BU at the end of December when the pool had about 1% of the total hash rate of the Bitcoin network. The Shanghai incorporated miner now has 3.3% of the total hash rate. The following chart demonstrates how, in just the past week, Bitcoin Unlimited historical Blocks per 1000 have reached their all-time high.  While Segwit had reached nearly 25% of explicit mining pool support in December, that lion’s share has decreased over the past month. Bitcoin Unlimited at the time of writing had 17.70% of overall support. Segwit was at the same time at 22.22%, after having dipped down to 17% a few hours earlier. Many have called BU’s recent hash rate gain more of a dip in Segwit adoption than anything else.  Since October, the number of Bitcoin Unlimited Nodes, to be sure, has skyrocketed.  While adoption rates for Segwit have flatlined.  With all this in mind, Segwit still dominates the number of blocks mined.  Just F2Pool and Antpool alone, both of which signed a 8MB recommendation in support of a block size increase but have not adopted alternative clients, could send BU over the 50% support level if they decide to start supporting BU. An alternative client, BU addresses scalability by enabling miners to mine blocks greater than 1MB. BU has pledged support for the Lightning Community and other off-chain technologies. BU developer Andrew Stone says Segwit represents “needless complexity added to the blockchain.” Mr. Stone told Bitcoin.com’s Jamie Redman: “[Segwit] does not scale enough to interest any companies in creating Bitcoin products or services, it does not even scale enough to significantly deploy off-chain scaling solutions.” The trend shows Segwit losing hash power and BU gaining. While in many ways this may represent a future changing of the guard for bitcoin, developers for ‘BU’, ‘Bitcoin Classic’ and even ‘Core’ insist to Bitcoin.com that relationships between Bitcoin developers are mostly amicable."
2017-01-19T01:00:49-04:00,Bitcoin Offers Diversification For Retirement Portfolios,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-offers-diversification-retirement-portfolios/,"Bitcoin is becoming a recognized asset class with a low correlation to other asset classes. This makes it a good option for diversifying investment portfolios with retirement accounts, and some options do exist for investing in bitcoin for retirement. Also read: Former US Mint Director Brings Bitcoin to Retirement Investing  Most investment advisors recommend having diversified retirement portfolios to limit exposure to any one type of asset which will subsequently reduce the volatility of a portfolio over time. According to research by Ark Invest and Coinbase, “Bitcoin is the only asset that maintains consistently low correlations with every other asset.” This makes bitcoin a great investment for diversifying portfolios. In addition, the joint report states that while its volatility is still high, it has dropped significantly and could reduce further in the future. An easy way for the mainstream investing public to invest in bitcoin is by investing in bitcoin funds which provide investors with exposure to the price performance of bitcoin without actually owning any bitcoins. These funds can usually be traded in traditional brokerage accounts such as at Fidelity Investments. Below are some options. Bitcoin Investment Trust One such fund is Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) whose shares are quoted on the QTCQX marketplace under the Alternative Reporting Standards. With Xapo Inc as the Custodian, the fund had $164.21 million under management at the end of 2016 and charges 2 percent annual fee. Within 12 months period, GBTC has returned 151.61 percent. GBTC can be purchased in traditional brokerage accounts. It is available for trade in Fidelity’s self-directed IRA, a Fidelity representative confirmed to Bitcoin.com. Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Notes Outside of the U.S, the Stockholm-based XBT Provider offers bitcoin exchange-traded notes (ETNs) called Bitcoin Tracker One and Bitcoin Tracker Euro. Unlike GBTC which invest in bitcoins, these ETNs are merely “non-equity linked certificates” which track bitcoin’s price, its prospectus describes. The certificates are not principal-protected but the company holds bitcoin equivalent to the value of ETNs issued and has a guarantor, Global Advisors (Jersey) Limited. These certificates charge an annual fee of 2.5 percent. In a 12 month period, Bitcoin Tracker One returned 124 percent while Bitcoin Tracker Euro returned 118 percent. While listed on Nasdaq Nordic in Stockholm, they are available in 179 countries including the U.S. for investors with accounts at Interactive Brokers. Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund Another bitcoin fund called Gabi is offered by Global Advisors itself, which claims to be 
the “first institutional-grade program for managing exposure to bitcoin,” according to its website. In December, the fund was listed on Channel Islands Securities Exchange (CISE). Gabi recently became a partner of Wealthics Global Partners, an independent provider of asset management solutions. Its management fee is 1%. In 2015, the fund returned 37.42 percent and 71.25 percent in 2016. For those wanting to invest in actual bitcoin, Fidelity Investments and most self-directed IRAs do not offer this option. However, a startup based in Sherman Oaks, California, called Bitcoin IRA, has been providing U.S. investors with the ability to hold actual bitcoin in an IRA since last June. The company’s chief strategist is Edmund C Moy, Director of the U.S. Mint from 2006 to 2011. Instead of charging an annual fee, Bitcoin IRA charges a 15 percent upfront setup fee. The company uses Genesis Trading to buy bitcoins and Bitgo for wallet management. Kingdom Trust is its custodian. According to a recent post on Reddit by the company’s Director of Marketing Amith Nirgunarthy: “The IRA owner has viewing privileges of its Bitgo wallet and has access to the public wallet address to verify its bitcoin content at any time with blockchain.info or any other company,” he added. In addition, Bitcoin IRA has a $1 million consumer protection insurance policy with Lloyds of London, he revealed. Currently, the company does not offer retirement accounts for non-US customers. However, “50% of our inquiries are international,” Nirgunarthy told Bitcoin.com. This is “something we are looking into,” he added. Do you think people should invest in bitcoin for retirement?

2017-01-18T19:00:25-04:00,Bitcoin’s “Bad Boy” Brand Name Here To Stay,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-bad-boy-brand-name-here-to-stay/,"The New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) reaffirms that bitcoin is an “official” US name for virtual currency. Incidentally, many find the name Bitcoin an “unattractive” brand name. Indeed, some have been calling for replacing its name, and its differing logos, to prevent Bitcoin’s demise. Critics also point out that Bitcoin still lacks a proper currency symbol. Nevertheless, defying marketing orthodoxy, Bitcoin outperformed fiat currencies for two years in a row.  Also read: Bitcoin Symbol Left Out of Unicode’s Latest Version  New York State Department of Financial Services (DFS) just approved Coinbase as a virtual currency and a money transmitter. In the respective press release of January 17, 2017, DFS explicitly refers to bitcoin, without capitalization, when referring to virtual currency, “Coinbase, which is subject to ongoing supervision by DFS, offers services for buying, selling, sending, receiving, and storing bitcoin.” Bitcoin with capitalization refers to the concept or the network itself. Good branding is a crucial tool, by which consumers identify and differentiate a product. The purpose of a brand name is also to attract and hold loyal consumers. Bad branding, on the other hand, leaves consumers unresponsive to the product or just turns them away. Brand name changes are often in the news. For example, Google changed to Alphabet, and Phillip Morris became Altria. Most recently, Yahoo Inc. announced that part of Yahoo is changing its name. The new name is Altaba. According to CNBC, “Experts say the renamed company could be a way for Yahoo to shake off its recent problems, with two data breaches affecting a total of 1.5 billion user accounts in 2016, as well as being a requirement of the deal.” Many feel uneasy with the Bitcoin name, and some have even been calling for a new name. Guy Lepage, Partner at Blockstack, wrote an article entitled “Bitcoin has a brand problem,” in November 2015. In it, Lepage specified a list of reasons supporting his call to rename Bitcoin. One of Lepage’s many objections is the name. “Plastic coins. The term evokes imagery of plastic coins from your childhood. This is a great example of what not to do when naming a product or technology. A little marketing research at the naming stage would have raised awareness that the finance industry takes their money very seriously and having a fun, playful name does not appeal to this audience.” Lepage’s article concludes with an appeal to have the Bitcoin name changed. Otherwise, Lepage predicts, “I fear without this change, it could be another 10 years before this network really takes off — if at all.” Bitboy, a Bitcoin Forum user, claims to be the author of the logo, which is an inclined, bold capital letter serif B, traversed by two vertical lines. Granted, the Bitcoin logo it is not a designer’s. It is not stylish or elegant. The logo does not convey all that Bitcoin represents. Most importantly, Bitcoin is not a company, product or brand to have a logo, says Melissa Volkmann, Lead Designer, HashRabbit Inc. Besides, Bitcoin’s logo is not a currency symbol, points out bitcoinsymbol.org. “Currencies are represented by symbols like $, € or ¥, aiming to be used everywhere by everybody.” In October 2015, Ken Shirriff submitted a proposal to Unicode, to have the currency symbols, the serif capital B with the two vertical strokes, added to the standard. As a result, in November 2015, Unicode recommended its integration into the Unicode standard. However, as Bitcoin.com reported in July 2016, the Unicode standard, version 9.0, excluded the Bitcoin’s currency symbol. Even if Bitcoin’s currency symbol is eventually included in the Unicode standard, Bitcoinsymbol.org dismisses U+20BF and demands the Unicode character U+0243, Ƀ instead.  The bitcoinsymbol.org project’s primary objective is to find the right symbol for Bitcoin. You can participate and share your ideas about this project here. The good news is that Microsoft will soon include a Bitcoin symbol in its Excel Accounting and Currency formats. “In 2017, Excel will be able to recognize, format, calculate, and analyze numbers expressed in Bitcoin currency. The new feature will be available for Excel running under Windows 10, Android, Mac OS, and iOS, and will include Excel Mobile versions as well,” says Martin Butler, Account Executive, Globals at Microsoft. Office Watch expects Microsoft to use the Unicode character Ƀ. Nevertheless, regardless of its unmarketable brand name or logo, and the fact that it lacks an official currency symbol, Bitcoin, thanks to its inherent virtues, is the most successful cryptocurrency. Indeed, as reflected by its performance, and ever-greater adoption rates, Bitcoin is on the path to becoming a prominent world currency.

2017-01-18T10:15:24-04:00,Report: The North American Bitcoin Conference – Day One,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-north-american-bitcoin-conference-day-one/,"The 2017 North American Bitcoin Conference packed a large crowd this year with hundreds of guests networking in the warm surroundings of beautiful Miami beach. Energy was in high spirits over the course of the event celebrating Bitcoin’s eight year anniversary. In its fourth year The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) hosted by Moe Levin once again brought our favorite digital asset to Miami. During the first night of the event many attendees spent the evening at the well known Clevelander Hotel for the TNABC pre party. The evening saw the bitcoin symbol displayed on the side of Miami’s famous hotel as the price per bitcoin started firing up its rockets that evening reaching $900 per BTC. Also read: Big Names Gather When North American Bitcoin Conference Comes Back to Miami  Day one of the conference held at the James L. Knight convention center was filled with more excitement. Attendees started arriving in the morning to catch a vast array of speakers and exhibitors set up in the hallways. TNABC exhibits included companies such as Airbitz, General Bytes, Ledger, Unsung and many more. Guests of the event purchased ‘Trump style’ red hats that stated “make bitcoin great again” while observing a vast array of products including a virtual reality station. The Miami Bitcoin event had no shortage of speakers as the entire day was filled with executives, developers, and innovators within the Bitcoin space. Early morning talks included Riccardo Spagni developer of Monero, Jonathan Chester from Bitwage, and Breadwallet’s Aaron Voisine. Big news came from Abra that morning as the company announced the launch of its global bitcoin network. Another highlight of the morning speakers was the investment panel hosted by Michael Terpin of Bitangels. The investment panel discussed bitcoin’s potential as a new asset class and subjects like private blockchains. Andrew Filipowski of Tally Capital and Chinese miner Chandler Gao got the crowd laughing as they both agreed private blockchains are a joke. Following the investment panel attendees listened to Bitcoin.com’s CEO Roger Ver discuss how bitcoin can strengthen the world economy. Another notable speaker was Genesis Mining founder Marco Streng who discussed if bitcoin mining was still profitable. Streng also detailed to the audience how they can research cloud mining operations that seemed shady and how to differentiate them from real mining firms. After the morning sessions guests checked out more exhibits and products like a Dash vending machine and Ledger hardware wallets. The afternoon attendees heard from the founder of OpenBazaar Brian Hoffman who announced the release of the platform’s 2.0 milestone one developer version. Hoffman also had a notable interview with the infamous podcast Bitcoin Uncensored located in the men’s restroom during the conference. Following Hoffman’s speech the crowd packed the room to hear the well known economist and author Jeffrey Tucker. Tucker described how he discovered bitcoin and how the decentralized currency will help revolutionize the failures of central banking. The libertarian luminary explained to the crowd that bitcoin was unlike any money the human race had seen before referencing the Misean regression theorem. Bitcoin has changed the old way of thinking about money as it emerged without deriving from a commodity asset explained Tucker. TNABC guests then heard from Unsung founder Jason King as he detailed how his startup was feeding the hungry utilizing bitcoin. King detailed the early stages of the applications growth and how Unsung volunteers in U.S. cities fed over 16 thousand homeless people so far. King also explained how the company Soylent was helping the team by supplying meal replacement drinks for deliveries. The first day of the Miami bitcoin conference was a huge success as the building was bustling with energy. The afternoon ended with talks from Gabriel Abed, founder of caribbean fintech company Bitt, and Jeremy Gardner from Augur discussing decentralized prediction markets. Guests ended the day with drinks and an after party at the South Beach establishment Fire and Ice. The crowd seemed very excited about day two featuring John McAfee and many innovators within the digital currency environment. As attendees left the building many witnessed a giant bitcoin billboard created by Genesis Mining driving around the the city’s financial district.

2017-01-18T03:00:34-04:00,Abra to Finally Launch Global Bitcoin Network Next Month,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/abra-finally-launch-global-bitcoin-network-next-month/,"Abra is planning to finally launch global support for its remittance and currency exchange app in February, as announced on Tuesday at the North American Bitcoin Conference in Miami by CEO Bill Barhydt. This would provide an easy way for people to trade their local currencies for bitcoin and vice versa. Also read: The US Reigns Supreme in the Bitcoin ATM Industry  Digital cash peer-to-peer network Abra allows users to send or receive money instantly, privately, and securely without the need for a bank account. Founded in 2014, the California-based company launched the Abra app in beta for both iOS and Android the following year, and received $14 million funding. The company announced that they would use bitcoin to build a way to seamlessly transfer any currency between any two smartphones worldwide, with very low fees. In early 2016, Abra finally began a test phase in the Philippines, using the Philippine Peso. That June, the company made its app available for users in the US allowing remittances between the US and the Philippines. Currently, the app only supports USD and PHP currencies with no bitcoin option available. On Tuesday, Abra announced that it will finally launch worldwide, stating that: Barhydt explained in Miami that Abra users will be able to send, receive, and store bitcoin inside the Abra app, in addition to 50 fiat currencies. The company admits that even though bitcoin is a large part of its business, “it’s been hidden in the background up until now.” However, that is changing with the upcoming launch. Further, the Abra app itself is a fully-working non-custodial digital currency wallet, meaning that Abra has no access to the user’s private key even if the users hold US Dollars in their wallet. Barhydt wrote in the announcement: Adding to the announcement was the global expansion of the Abra Teller network or “Human ATMs.” This network, which Abra has successfully tested in the Philippines, allows people worldwide to use Abra and become a currency exchanger using bitcoin. Barhydt revealed the convention that there are already “a few thousand” Abra human tellers in the Philippines. Tellers can make money while helping their community send and receive money,” Barhydt claims, adding that: For example, a consumer holding US Dollars can meet a Teller, and process a withdrawal to receive Argentine Pesos. Neither party even knows that a dual-currency-trade transaction took place. Abra estimates $30-$40 million per week is now traded in person in “fiat vs Bitcoin” in over 75 countries. “This is a huge step forward in realizing our vision of anyone being able to send money easily to anyone else in the world, instantly, privately, and securely,” Barhydt noted. Abra charges no transfer fees to users. However, individual Abra tellers set their own fees and exchange rates so city rates may be lower than rural rates due to higher competition. Their rates can be found by opening the app and look at nearby tellers to see their fee details. What do you think of Abra’s products? Let us know in the comments section below.

Some bitcoin participants are beginning to fear a negative outcome for bitcoin with so few producers of the digital currency’s mining hardware.  In 2013, companies like Black Arrow Software, Cointerra, Hashfast, Vmc, Kncminer and others offered different hardware miner models. Today, the competition for consumer-grade mining hardware has largely dwindled to two companies: Canaan and Bitmain. The-Beijing based Bitmain announced Tuesday the launch of its new Antminer T9, which features fewer ASIC chips and increased power consumption over the hardware provider’s prior models, leaving questions as to how they’ve made their overall system more efficient. Also Read: Why Bitcoin is Close to a Record Breaking 3 Exahashes of Processing Power Bitmain’s T9 represents a decrease in the number of hashing chips in the unit over its predecessor, the S9, which had 189 of the company’s BM1387 chips. The new T9 carries just 171. The power draw, 1400 Watts, represents an increase over the S9, as well, which drew about 1350 watts. ASIC (short for ‘application-specific integrated circuit’) is a microchip designed for special applications. Due to the nature of bitcoin mining technology, the efficiency of Bitmain’s ASIC chips is considered the most important aspect of the company’s mining ‘rigs’. Bitcoiners on social media have lots of questions about the company’s plans for its ASIC chips. “Bitmain has emerged as a major threat to the decentralization of Bitcoin,” suggests ‘moral_agent‘ on Reddit. “They control too much of the production of mining hardware. They control too much of the hashpower.” Some wonder if a lack of competition has harmed the quality of machines available. Bitcoin mining insiders have heretofore wondered about Chinese spending on bitcoin mining. “We have tried to calculate the amount of money that the Chinese have invested in mining, we estimate it to be in the hundreds of millions of dollars,” CEO of now defunct Kncminer, Sam Cole, said. “Even with free electricity we cannot see how they will ever get this money back. Either they don’t know what they are doing, but that is not very likely at this scale, or they have some secret advantage that we don’t know about.” The technology with which Bitmain works, to be sure, is complicated. “Producing the latest BM1387 chip based on a 16nm process node has been more technologically challenging for our engineering team than any of the previous chips had been,” Bitmain Head of Marketing Nishant Sharma told Bitcoin.com in a previous conversation.  Bitmain have increased efficiency as such, that they can use fewer chips and still reach a higher hash rate. Perhaps, the Beijing mining hardware company discovered ways to increase power to their chips without ruining them. Perhaps they’ve also managed to have the chips deliver results with less faults and/or developed a better cooling system capable of handling higher clock frequencies. If each chip is better tuned, and can handle more power, perhaps it is not that strange T9 consumes more power with fewer chips – a fact many commenters online have questioned. [We’ve reached out to Bitmain for additional comments, Editor’s note.] Earlier models than Bitmain’s T9, such as S7 and S9, have been credited with providing the Bitcoin blockchain with much of its processing power. The T9, with 11.5 terahashes per second and the BM1387 chip available in preceding models, resembles greatly the S9, but with a lower power efficiency. It is also less expensive than the S9. According to social media reports, before the T9 came to market, Bitmain had not sold an Antminer in at least a couple of months. Interested parties were left searching eBay and Amazon for mining equipment. Bitmain released January 13 the fifth and sixth batches of its smaller miner, the Antminer R4; at 7.5TH/s and 8.7TH/s, respectively. The company is known as one of the few companies which regularly launches new mining products.  Thanks to an arm’s race of Bitcoin mining equipment, new Avalon and Antminer models always attract much attention. Mining company Canaan’s most recent model is the Avalon720. The preceding Avalon 6 and 7 are considered functional pieces of bitcoin mining hardware, and to have contributed a significant amount of hashing power to the bitcoin network, but not as much as Bitmain. 
 Bitfury may have engineered the next best thing to Bitmain, say some, and also design their own hardware. But the company does not sell mining rigs to the general public. Rather, besides mining Bitcoin it leases hash rate and offers “blockchain services”. This leaves relatively few hardware options, perhaps, for those interested in Bitcoin mining compared to how the market looked just two years ago, when there were several mining hardware manufacturers to choose from. What do you think about the state of bitcoin mining hardware in 2017? Will we see another contender enter the space in 2017? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-17T19:00:00-04:00,The US Reigns Supreme in the Bitcoin ATM Industry,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-us-reigns-supreme-in-the-bitcoin-atm-industry/,"Coinatmradar, a website mapping and tracking trends for Bitcoin ATMs (BTMs) around the world, recently released their 2016 data as well as projected trends for 2017. According to the site, the United States is dominating the BTM market with market share of 73 percent. Also read: 10,000+ EU ATMs to Cash Out Bitcoin  At press time, Coinatmradar displays 951 BTMs in 55 countries from 192 operators, 555 of which are located in the United States. The country with the second most BTMs is Canada with 136 BTMs, followed by the United Kingdom with 47 BTMs, the site shows. The U.S. has been dominating the market since the site started providing data in 2014. “United States of America market will be still dominating with potentially increasing its share further,” states Coinatmradar’s most recent blog post. The BTM numbers do not include kiosks, retail outlets, and other machines worldwide that sell bitcoin as one of their many functions. Coinatmradar currently shows over 36,000 of non-BTM locations globally to buy bitcoin such as the Swiss railway machines and Canada’s Flexepin system. On Coinmap, there are a total number of 8,497 merchants worldwide including ATMs listed. Bitcoin.com interviewed Vlad of CoinATMRadar about the growth trend of the BTM industry from his perspective, and why so many operators are choosing the U.S. Bitcoin.com (BC): The BTM industry appears to be growing faster as time goes by. Where does Coinatmradar see the growth coming from? Coinatmradar (CAR): The U.S. is dominating bitcoin ATM market with 73% of all machines worldwide (share was growing steadily over last 2 years), most new installations happen there. Also it is usually existing operators enlarge their networks of machines, while new operators also appear, but not at that scale. BC: Privacy has always been a huge reason for people to choose BTMs over bitcoin exchanges. Are the BTM manufacturers now only making machines that require identification? CAR: All top bitcoin ATM manufacturers have identification features implemented, like ID scan, phone registration per SMS etc. The other question is whether all operators use it, and it depends mostly on geographic area and what kind of regulation is there, also depends on ATM operator risks tolerance. From what I see almost all machines in regulated areas have limits and verification implemented in some form. That is the legal requirement, and not obeying can result in huge fines or even jail trial. However, there are still sometimes machines where you can buy bitcoins without registration, but I see fewer and fewer of those, as long as regulation matures. I mean definitely some customers use machines wearing hoods and sunglasses and supplying burn phone numbers, although it might not work in many cases. But there are other categories of customers who use it not solely because of privacy reasons. I’ve heard about other cases like someone was remitting money to a friend, who just went over the sell bitcoin process and showing QR code displayed at the machine to a friend over skype call, and then his friend initiated the transaction on bitcoin machine remotely by sending bitcoins to this address, which dispensed bills shortly. That was the time when 0-confirmation transactions were treated differently, I know some operators have still immediate dispensing feature depending on the amount. So this was immediate remittance transaction, and if you are at a machine which charges 7% on small amounts you are better off than using WU [Western Union] for example, given that sender already has bitcoins. BC: North America, despite having a strong fiat currencies already, seems to get
far more BTMs than other regions, such as South America. Can you explain why the BTMs are being deployed so much more in there instead of where they may be needed more? CAR: I can only assume. There are several factors that I see: BC: Are any countries outright banning BTMs? CAR: I don’t know about the cases where bitcoin ATMs were banned in particular, usually it is about Bitcoin or cryptocurrency in general. E.g. you can not find a single machine in Russia or India. Sometimes, it is not about a ban, but rather about very strict regulation and requirements, e.g. in Germany in order to operate a bitcoin machine you are required to obtain similar as bank level license from BaFin, which makes it practically impossible to run a machine there. There were some installed before, but closed later on, in many cases due to regulation. What do you think of the Bitcoin ATM market? Let us know in the comments section below.

The USPIS jurisdiction encompasses “crimes that may adversely affect or fraudulently use the U.S. Mail, the postal system or postal employees.” The listing hints the agency is sharpening its cyber crime efforts. Also Read: Did Julian Assange Use Bitcoin to Prove He Is Alive?  “Candidates shall be capable of performing a prioritized assessment of the data to identify the most critical and reliable data in order to identify bitcoins, locations, accounts, services, travels, email addresses, IP addresses and other pattern of life data in an effort to determine physical attribution of an Internet identity,” the USPIS stipulates of the Washington, D.C-based position. The USPIS prefers candidates with experience evaluating internet information in social media, chats, forums, darknets, Tor network, news feeds, internet relay chats and other web materials.  “The investigative/internet analyst shall analyze the data from these various sources and identify investigative opportunities and intelligence to support the many investigative programs within the USPIS to include cybercrime, narcotics, identify theft, dangerous goods and workplace violence,” the USPIS explains.  A Redditor, going by the pseudonym ‘btcbadboy’, posted on Monday screenshots seen of an apparent desktop client with the job listing posted. The account, and all related posts, have since been deleted. The original poster (‘OP’), who claimed to work for a government contractor, shared his thoughts on the job listing based on his experience.  “[T]his is more geared towards [darknet markets]…” stated Btcbadboy. “Heroin and opiates are apparently becoming a major issue and for some reason they believe shutting down the DNM’s will help with this…”   According to the listing, the USPIS seeks engineers and analysts to de-anonymize the darknet. This web research could be coupled with USPS databases of everyone’s mail already held on file with the agency, the ‘OP’ opined further. “We typically work with [USPIS] to staff their tech guys like network engineers and logistic DBA guys,” Btcbadboy comments. “They are hiring 34 people for this role, or ideally 34. I know this doesn’t sound like much but this is a pretty big order compared to most positions with them.” Btcbadboy adds: “From what i gathered off the phone call suspicious or tainted transactions will be logged to a database that can then be utilized by USPS as well as other agencies. They will also be using the database to find address trends (whatever that means).” Alongside experience with cyber intelligence and software tools to search and mine the clearnet and the darknet/deep web, the USPIS seeks an individual with an “advanced understanding of methods used by cyber criminals to hide themselves on the internet.” Commenters expressed the job, for which one must be able to receive a Public Trust and hold a US green card or passport, might resemble the relationship between the NSA and private contractor firms like Booze Allen Hamilton, which provide technicians to the NSA, including whistleblower Edward Snowden.  The listing highlights USPS efforts to grow cybercrime related abilities. “The cybercrime program reviews network data, collects forensic images, researches tools and technologies, administers hardware and software, conducts online investigations into black market/dark web activities affecting the USPS, its customer and employees,” states the job listing. “The investigative/internet analyst shall be leverage open source and commercial software tools to review, assess and collect data from a disparate list of open and closed web sources, including but not limited to news publications, blogs, social media platforms, paste sites, government websites, forums, onion sites.” The USPIS aims to crack down on “high profile market places and cyber-criminals that are using the US mail or targeting the USPS, its products, service, network or employees for attack or exploitation.” What do you think about the USPIS analyst position?

2017-01-16T12:00:14-04:00,Gold and Bitcoin Form Symbiotic Relationship,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/gold-bitcoin-form-symbiotic-relationship/,"“I had to change my thought process to understand that bitcoin is no enemy of gold and silver,” says monetary expert Andy Hoffman, who writes for the precious metals website Miles Franklin. “When bitcoin hit price parity with gold in 2013, I was angry. I knew nothing about it. I assumed it was like the Federal Reserve. That, instead of 21 million coins, there could be 21 trillion coins at someone’s whim”. Today, Mr. Hoffman regularly covers bitcoin and calls gold and the digital currency “natural allies.” Also Read: How to Use Bitcoin to Become a Perpetual Traveler A symbiotic relationship between precious metals and bitcoin has formed over the years. It started first with numerous gold dealers accepting the digital currency for metal. From there, the relationship blossomed. Makes sense. Digital currency bitgold programmer, Nick Szabo, and the pseudonymous bitcoin creator, Satoshi Nakamoto, both understood Bitcoin as a commodity-based money, like gold.  “It had been our idea for quite some time,” explains BitStamp CEO Nejc Kodrič of the world’s second largest bitcoin exchange’s decision to add physical gold delivery as a withdrawal option.  In early 2015, Bitstamp announced that, in cooperation with central European MORO & Kunst d.o.o, the exchange would offer its European clientele gold products by Argor heraeus, Switzerland the Austrian Mint. “Bitcoin is an evolutionary step of money and store of values,” Mr. Kodrič told Bitcoin.com. “I think it’s the last step in this evolution.” The bitcoin exchange founder believes that, in general, money is an abstraction. “Even gold,” he says. “All it takes is for a critical mass of people to believe something has value. To hold this value, it needs certain properties. Gold is just a rock. It has value because it has the properties that bitcoin copies. A lot of goldbugs have a quasi-libertarian mindset, so they don’t trust government nor paper money, and more such people are becoming interested in bitcoin.” “The math, the proof of work, and all the technology behind bitcoin represents the greatest experiment in money of the last few hundred years,” says Josh Crumb, co-founder and Chief Strategy Officer of Bitgold, now operating as GoldMoney. “Digital currency was always designed to mimic gold equity-based money, instead of debt-based money.” GoldMoney added a technical layer to traditional third-party gold storage. The company sought to make the ‘yellow metal’ interoperable with the banking system.  The company’s CTO was an early security consultant for Ripple and early bitcoin community member. He built a bitcoin wallet into the front end of an early version of the Bitgold website. “We are a hybrid between bitcoin and currency,” Mr. Crumb explains. “We don’t pretend to be fully decentralized nor anonymous. We have an equity-based money that is also a very good store of value.” GoldMoney was inspired by bitcoin to make cross-border microtransactions over the internet.  “We can’t be fully distributed like bitcoin,” explains Mr. Crumb. “If the person is not present to their titled gold, you have to have an intermediary. We must also know our customers. But we can use the principles of decentralization.” Bitgold strives to act as merely software architecture.  “We have Brinks and Royal Canadian Mint as custodians, but also as clearing agents,” says Mr. Crumb. “We may have bought gold just seconds before from a bullion bank, and Brinks or the Royal Canadian Mint clear the transactions.” Bitgold seeks to recreate gold with a digital, distributed and payments emphasis. “A ledger where third parties confirm transactions,” Mr. Crumb explains. “Different price feeds from different bullion banks, settlement confirmation by various custodians and security. We saw the open nature of bitcoin and thought gold should be transacted as such.”  Mr. Crumb suggests bitgold is as decentralized as Coinbase, the popular San Francisco-based bitcoin exchange. “People are trusting bitcoin to the custodial nature of Coinbase,” he says. “We have a similar type of business model, as an exchange, payment operator and custodian for those who wish to use gold as money.”  He adds: “We know gold works as store of value, tested with math and history. What we want to do is make it a good medium of exchange.”   Different people have different views about the relationship between gold and bitcoin. Yet, there seems to be some common ground. “Today I see that both are fighting against the fiat regime in different ways,” explains Mr. Hoffman, who believes bitcoin is more speculative and risky than gold. “I’ve been searching my entire career for anything else besides gold and silver that serves as money and a store of value, and this is the first thing I’ve found.”  GoldMoney, furthermore, is not designed to be antagonistic to bitcoin. “Bitcoin is making everybody think more about what is money, and whether or not our money serves us well,” Mr. Crumb says. “Bitcoin motivated us to take gold from an archaic business to a modern technology. We are happy gold and bitcoin are having an influence on central banks together.” What do you think about gold and bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-16T09:00:14-04:00,Why Bitcoin Is Close to a Record-Breaking 3 Exahashes Of Processing Power,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/why-bitcoin-is-close-to-a-record-breaking-3-exahashes-processing-power/,"The bitcoin hash rate currently nears 3 exahashes, representing an all-time high for the processing power of the Bitcoin network. The escalating hash rate concurs with continuing social media reports that Beijing-based Bitmain Technologies Limited, a company which supplies bitcoin mining equipment, suffers consistent supply shortages due to high demand. Also Read: Bitcoin Mining Intensifies in Q4 2016 At a time when increasing numbers of individuals and organizations are considering mining bitcoin (Berkeley’s ET research effort SETI showed interest last week for example), and the bitcoin hash rate has skyrocketed past all time highs, there could be a shortage of equipment amid increasing interest in bitcoin mining.  Consumers and mining enthusiasts have reported shortages since the fall of the Antminer R4 and S9, newer rigs which experts cite as responsible for much of the increase in the hash rate. If new generations of miners are more efficient than previous ones then the total exahash rate should increases approximately by that difference over the time it takes to replace the bitcoin mining industry’s current hardware. Any shortages would prolong the time it took to get new mining rigs ‘into the wild.’ “Global bitcoin hash rate is proportional to current bitcoin value and the efficiency of current generation hardware with a lag time”, Con Kolivas, the mining pool ‘CKPool‘ founder, tells Bitcoin.com. “Any spikes you see follow new generation hardware being released at the rate hardware is being released and the rest of the rise lags behind the changes in bitcoin value.” The correlation between hash rate and Bitcoin value is complex. Mr. Kolivas suggests, though, there is a cause-and-effect interplay. “Mining does not affect value,” Mr. Kolivas says. “Value affects mining hash rate. The hash rate rises follow the releases of the Antminer S7 and S9 along with the Avalon 6 and 7.” There have been no reports of shortages at Canaan, the manufacturer of Avalon bitcoin mining equipment. Bitmain is currently in the process of building another data center in China’s North Western province of Xinjiang. “The planned data center would be capable of consuming up to 135 megawatts of power, which will add it to the list of the highest powered data centers in the world,” the company wrote in a press release. “Wind and solar energy would be the primary source of power for the data center. It is specially designed for high-performance computing and, considering the interest of most investors in the data center, mining of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin will be its major application.” Despite increasing interest in bitcoin mining, Google search queries, according to Google Trends, remain far off its all-time highs set in the winter of 2013-2014. On January 1, 2016 the hash rate per second was 707,457 TH/S. Nearly one year later, the hash rate was 2,050,572 TH/S or nearly a 190% increase on the year. For the Bitcoin hash rate, this marks the single largest gain in a one year period yet. Starting in the second half of 2015, the Bitcoin hash rate, the overall computing power of the miners on the network, made dramatic gains – more so than in any previous year.  You can see in the chart below how, even when compared to 2013 as the Bitcoin price reached an all-time high of $1122, the contemporary hash rate is dramatically higher. The hash rate, a measuring unit of the processing power being used to solve intensive mathematical operations for the Bitcoin network, refers to how powerful Bitcoin miners are collectively. Blockchain.info defines hash rate as, “The estimated number of terahashes per second (trillions of hashes per second) the Bitcoin network is performing.”  The term ‘difficulty’ measures how difficult it is to crack a code to discover a hash below or above an expected value. Currently, the Bitcoin network is expected to create 12.5 bitcoins every 10 minutes, though this varies.  The hash function used in Bitcoin is the cryptographic model SHA-256. Hash functions, deterministic yet unpredictable, have led to a hardware-based arm’s race in which increasingly faster Bitcoin mining hardware is continually developed to compute the SHA-256 computational puzzles that must be cracked to mine bitcoins. Much such hardware came online at the end of 2015 and into 2016, contributing to the exploding hash rate.  What do you think about the hash rate in 2016?

2017-01-16T06:00:33-04:00,How to Maximize Bitcoin’s Value in a Digital US Inheritance,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-maximize-bitcoins-value-in-a-digital-inheritance/,"When bitcoins are passed to an heir in a US inheritance, they are subject to a different tax rule than usual. The cost basis is no longer the purchase price of the bitcoins, which can lead to an heir paying less or more capital gains tax depending on whether the bitcoins had appreciated or depreciated. A little planning can help an heir maximize the value of bitcoins in an estate and pay less in taxes. Also read: Death & Bitcoin: How I Prepared My Family’s Digital Inheritance  The U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS) treats bitcoin as property. For bitcoins held as a capital asset, as opposed to income or mined, any gain or loss from selling or exchanging them would be taxed as a capital gain or loss. The amount of tax owed depends on the cost basis of the bitcoins, which is usually the purchase price paid. If bitcoins are sold for more than the cost basis, a capital gains tax is owed to the IRS. However, if they are sold for less than the cost basis, there is a capital loss which can be deducted against taxable income. “Like any other asset, Bitcoin becomes part of your estate when you die; it’s not something you voluntarily “put into” your estate,” Jeff Vandrew Jr, an attorney who specializes in estate planning told Bitcoin.com. Vandrew explained: Unlike the usual case of the purchase price being the cost basis, the fair market value on the day of the bitcoin holder’s death is the new cost basis for inherited bitcoin. This tax rule is sometimes called the ‘tax basis step-up’ or ‘tax basis step-down’ depending on whether the market value is lower or higher than the purchase price. No matter when the heir spends the bitcoins later, the cost basis for the inherited bitcoins is still their fair market value on the day of the holder’s death. Talking about the tax-basis step-up, Vandrew noted that “For highly appreciated bitcoin, this may be great. For bitcoin that has depreciated since purchase, this could be bad.” If a bitcoin owner dies owning bitcoins that have appreciated in value, the ‘tax basis step-up’ rule will help the heir lower any capital gains tax owed. For example, if the deceased bought a bitcoin in 2013 at $100 and died in 2016 when the price was $700, the cost basis for the inherited bitcoin is $700, not $100. The heir spending the bitcoin later on when the price is $1000, say, would only incur a taxable gain of $300 ($1000-$700). In instead, the price has tanked to less than $700, a capital loss can be deducted up to a certain limit and the excess carried over to be deducted in future years. Vandrew noted: In the rare case the bitcoin holder dies owning bitcoin that has declined in value since purchase, the cost basis for the heir is lowered at the date of death. When the heir cashes out the bitcoins, more tax will be owed since the cost basis is lower. For example, if the deceased bought a bitcoin at the end of 2013 when the price was $1000 and died when the price fell to $700 in 2016, the cost basis for the heir is still $700. If he then spends the bitcoin when the price is $1000, his taxable gain would be $300. Vandrew said: Since the heir cannot take the tax deduction on the deceased’s price depreciation, one solution is for the bitcoin holder to cash out the bitcoin before his death, taking the tax deduction at that time. Bitcoin can then be re-purchased at a lower price. Disclaimer: This article is for informational purpose only and should not be used as a replacement for professional tax advice.

Reports of bitcoin bans, jail sentences for holding cryptocurrencies, and other regulatory policy headlines have spread like wildfire. Throughout many of these stories Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister, Alexey Moiseev, has often shared very bi-polar messages concerning the cryptocurrency. Also Read: Markets Update: Cryptocurrency Prices Begin Rebounding According to a recent report from Russia’s regional news publication TASS, Moiseev the Finance Minister and his colleagues don’t view bitcoin as a threat. This is in contrast to Moiseev’s rumored proposals in the past concerning bitcoin regulation. Last summer the Finance Minister detailed cryptocurrency mining would be deemed illegal but the digital asset could be traded similar to foreign currency exchange (forex) markets. This past week Moiseev told reporters on January 12: Russia has had a strange relationship with bitcoin for quite some time. Back in 2014 many people thought bitcoin was illegal in the country according to reports from media outlets like CNBC and the European Parliament. Over the course of the past few years, bitcoin-related websites have been blocked such as the exchange BTC-e and Localbitcoins. Following these events, the Deputy Finance Minister announced new law was coming in 2017 that would treat virtual currencies like forex. Then this past fall the Russian Federal Tax Service revealed letter No. ОА-18-17/1027, which described the agency’s position over cryptocurrencies. One statement in the service letter noted: It will be interesting to see what transpires from Moiseev’s recent statements, and the effect of the Federal Tax Service’s recent statements. Many believe the service letter was a turning point for bitcoin usage within Russia. Moiseev stating virtual currencies are not a threat is certainly a good sign. Especially when the Finance Minister was supposedly supporting prison sentences just last year, according to the Russian news outlet Interfax.  Russia’s Localbitcoins volumes reached an all time high this past December. What do you think about Russia’s relationship with bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-15T12:00:18-04:00,Things Bitcoin Companies Try To Patent,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/things-bitcoin-companies-try-to-patent/,"Amazon. AT&T. Bank of America. Goldman Sachs. IBM. JPMorgan. Mastercard. R3. Western Union. Verizon. These are just a few of the corporations which have filed blockchain-related patent applications worldwide. But, what about bitcoin-specific patent applications, not blockchain? Also Read: IP Trolling Becoming Threat as More Firms File Blockchain Patents  Because Satoshi Nakamoto published the Bitcoin white paper and disappeared shortly after releasing the early versions of the digital currency, Bitcoin is part of the public domain. Only novel additions, variations, and use-cases might be patented around the technology. A search of the United States Patent and Trademark Office database reveals 148 patents which mention the term bitcoin. “Bitcoin inventions typically involve applications of, or improvements to, the Bitcoin protocol,” Attorney Howard H. Sheerin of Silicon Valley IP tells Bitcoin.com. “Bitcoin inventions are typically software inventions with the patent claims covering operations executed by a general purpose computer.” For example, bitcoin miner Bitmain has filed the following patent; the company describes its “Optimizing method, device, and circuit for Hash computing chip of bitcoin proof of work” which “relates to the technical field of cipher computing, computer network, and integrated circuits.” Bitmain adds in a 2014 application: “The method, device and circuit provided by the invention greatly reduce the power consumption of the circuit.” 21 Inc’s patent application for a “Digital currency mining circuitry with adaptable difficulty compare capabilities” represents a “cryptographic hashing circuitry such as mining circuitry used to mine digital currency may be formed on an integrated circuit…” Bitgo’s application pertains to “virtual currency address security.” As described in the application, “The network device is configured to generate a digital currency address using the public keys of the two or more second public-private key pairs and a public key of the first public-private key pair.” San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase has filed several applications, including a patent for a “security system forming part of a bitcoin host computer.” Coinbase also filed a patent for a “computer system for making a payment using a tip button.” The application describes a system by which “bitcoin can be sent to an email address, ” and a “tip button rewards content creators for their efforts.” Also described is a bitcoin exchange enabling “users to set prices that they are willing to sell or buy bitcoin and execute such trades.” Coinbase has numerous patents filed globally. Popular gift card for bitcoin company Gyft filed for a blockchain-related patent. The company describes a “method for providing fraud protection and transaction tracing for gift card accounts through the use of a public blockchain ledger.” In the patent, digital gift cards are associated with tokens that can be sent between user accounts. Gyft adds: “Numerous types of transactions are published to the blockchain ledger including initial purchases, reserving/claiming of debit codes, transfers of tokens between accounts, and depleting of gift card value associated with a token.” As well, blockchain technology company Blockstream filed a patent for a system which encrypts “an amount transacted on a blockchain ledger while preserving the transaction’s ability to be verified.” Many non-bitcoin entities have filed patents containing blockchain-related language. Craig Wright, who controversially claimed to be the bitcoin founder but failed to provide proof, filed dozens of patent applications with the UK Intellectual Property Office.  Nautilus Hyosung, a global provider of banking industry products, filed a patent claim for a “bitcoin transaction system using ATM.” Nautilus Hyosung describes: “…[B]y connecting a management server for managing ATMs with a bitcoin exchange market server…a client can purchase bitcoin from the bitcoin exchange market by depositing cash directly using the ATM or sell own bitcoin to the bitcoin exchange market and withdraw cash.” “Some industry participants object to software patents for covering simple inventions that unfairly impede innovation,” Mr. Sheerin notes. “Recent court decisions are sympathetic to this concern and have invalidated certain software patents covering inventions on well-known or obvious ideas that are merely implemented using a general purpose computer.” This does not mean all software inventions are unpatentable, including those related to bitcoin. “The courts have found software patents valid when the underlying idea of a software invention improves the operation of a general purpose computer in a manner not suggested by the prior art,” Mr. Sheerin explains. “The legal question for Bitcoin inventions is the same as for other types of inventions: does the patented invention cover a novel, non-obvious idea? This standard will likely be applied to bitcoin inventions creating a spectrum ranging from clearly patentable inventions, to questionably patentable inventions, to clearly unpatentable inventions.”  Bitcoin patents, even when held by companies in good standing, raise concern in the Bitcoin Community. Let alone when held by multinational corporations. To dissuade concern, Bitgo and Blockstream adopted Innovators Patent Agreement (IPA), a new way of patent assignment pioneered by Twitter to keep control with engineers and designers. It’s a commitment by a company that a patent can only be used for defensive purposes. Coinbase wrote in a November blog post it was leaning towards adopting a Formal Patent Pledge.  MIT Digital Currency Initiative Brian Forde has floated the idea of a defensive patent pool like the Open Invention Network for Linux.

The agency’s warning has bundled bitcoin investment with two Multi-Level-Marketing (MLM) operations well known for deceptive activities. Also read: Buyer Beware! The Definitive OneCoin Ponzi Exposé On January 12, the Nigeria’s SEC issued a statement cautioning citizens from investing in digital tokens such as Bitcoin, Onecoin, and Swisscoin. SEC details the public should be aware that these investments are “risky by nature” and some of them are “fraudulent pyramid schemes.” The Nigerian authorities state in the public notice: The news comes after the well known Ponzi MMM Nigeria has become increasingly popular in the country. MLM and pyramid-like schemes have been catching the eyes of the country’s financial authorities as law enforcement agencies worldwide begin to investigate these operations. Sadly the authorities have placed bitcoin alongside two shady businesses, Onecoin and Swisscoin, which both practice MLM techniques. Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme, Ponzi, and proponents are not recruiting people for rewards. Unlike Swisscoin and Onecoin the cryptocurrency is studied by academic leaders, used by citizens voluntarily, and is a real peer-to-peer decentralized network. Both of these organizations use MLM methods of recruiting and promised returns after investing. Bitcoin.com has done extensive reporting on Onecoin as a known scam and most likely the token isn’t even a cryptocurrency at all. The token doesn’t seem to have a legitimate blockchain, and the so-called digital currency is not listed on market capitalization browsers like Coinmarketcap.com or Coincap.io. Onecoin is also being investigated by law enforcement in many countries worldwide. Many bitcoin proponents have firmly established that bitcoin has nothing to do with this MLM operation. In fact, some well-known bitcoiners have publicly stated that Onecoin is a scam and should be recognized as such. Furthermore, the hosts from Bitcoin Uncensored recently crashed a Onecoin meeting in Florida revealing it is not so easy to cash out Onecoins. In fact, it may not be even possible at all.  Swisscoin is so-called ‘cryptocurrency’ that utilizes MLM recruiting as well. Swisscoin affiliates swear their digital token will one day outperform bitcoin much like Onecoin’s claim to be the “bitcoin killer.” On various social media outlets, you can see Swisscoin members spamming threads with “opportunities” to invest. The operation deploys services called “training packs” which consist of investment packages such as a trainee, a trader, or crypto-director. One publication details their opinion of Swisscoin’s MLM schemes stating: Bitcoin is a legitimate cryptocurrency, and many proponents will never tell you that you must invest in the digital asset. A vast majority will tell you if you are looking to invest in bitcoin only put in what you can afford to lose. The bitcoin community has no problem explaining that the nascent cryptocurrency can be volatile and risky. Bitcoin is an experiment and, unlike Onecoin and Swisscoin, there is no central organization behind the network. Onecoin and Swisscoin are basically a new breed of parasites trying to use the the great attributes of bitcoin as their cover. They are polar opposites of true cryptocurrency protocols and should not be associated with bitcoin. However, these “fake crypto” MLM operations continue to pretend to be cryptocurrencies. Unfortunately, some law enforcement authorities and a few country’s financial agencies have blended these two pyramid schemes with a legitimate cryptocurrency. What do you think about the Nigerian SEC associating bitcoin with these two MLM operations? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-15T06:00:51-04:00,Deploy Servers Anonymously with Bitcoin from the Command Line,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/deploy-servers-anonymously-with-bitcoin-from-the-command-line/,"Developers often build and test their applications in temporary server environments called cloud or virtual servers, from infrastructure providers such as Amazon, Digital Ocean, and the bitcoin-accepting Vultr. A new service has been launched to help developers deploy servers instantly, anonymously, and pay for them with bitcoin. Also read: Meet Bitcoin Unlimited Developer Andrew Stone Signing up for one of the infrastructure providers usually requires opening up a browser window to sign up and giving away personal information, especially if a credit card is used for payments. With many steps required to sign up, the process is not instant by any means. For developers who usually prefer to use command-line window for speed, signing up for these services is a tedious process. Bitcoiner Teran McKinney found a solution for developers. The full-stack developer who lives in San Antonio, Texas, launched a service called Sporestack this week, allowing developers to deploy servers with bitcoin, while remaining anonymous. The service is purely API driven and requires no accounts. Using Sporestock, developers can sign up for a Vultr virtual server instantly using the command line interface. Using bitcoin to pay gives no personal information away. McKinney described that the service is: Sporestack can be run with a single command at any unix or linux command prompt. It quickly installs an interface to spin up a custom-made Virtual Server environment that lasts between one and 28 days, depending on how much the user chooses to pay. One day of the Sporestack service currently costs about 60 cents in bitcoin, and the maximum deployment time is 28 days, which costs about $9 at press time. McKinney explained the reason behind the 28-day maximum, stating that “I also don’t like accounts or holding any more data than you need to.” He noted that: McKinney has even added single-command instances of Bitcoin and Tor nodes for those who would like to support bitcoin or the tor network as inexpensively and easily as possible. The missing link of paying with bitcoin at a command line was having an application create a QR code image in a terminal. McKinney used a Python library’s API to render the QR code in his command-line bitcoin payment processor called Coinfee. Sporestack is the second application using Coinfee. The first application was Answer Market, a very simple bitcoin-accepting paywall generator that allows anyone to charge money to see a simple text data file, such as the answer to a question, a game coupon, or perhaps a way to deliver some code. These questions and answers can be placed online anywhere Javascript code snippets are allowed. McKinney also hosts a public directory of them for any users wanting to list theirs for more exposure.

2017-01-14T12:00:24-04:00,Bitcoin Mining Power Growing Bigger But Greener,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mining-power-growing-bigger-but-greener/,"Bitcoin has created a vast mining sector within the network’s economy that is growing exponentially. Mining bitcoin has spread the technology towards new thoughts concerning energy consumption, ways to utilize bitcoin mining’s heat source, greener energy solutions and more. Also read: Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Inspections Cause Price Drop and FUD As it stands today, the Bitcoin mining sector is robust with computations faster than the world’s top 500 supercomputers combined. The global bitcoin mining economy consumes nearly $500 million in electrical and operational costs. Moreover, it’s estimated the bitcoin network could use as much electricity as Denmark by the year 2020. It’s safe to say securing the bitcoin network through mining is costly and consumes a lot of energy, but may offer a myriad of other benefits to the equation. For instance, mining equipment produces a significant amount of heat as the machines operate 24-7. Over the past few years, miners have found ways to utilize this heat source to warm their homes and warehouses. Just recently a South Florida distillery has used the heat from bitcoin mining equipment to accelerate rum barrel aging. Furthermore, bitcoin miners have been known to heat their homes during winter months alongside mining facilities utilizing the heat source for their benefit. It’s common for data centers to utilize the heat for many types of purposes. One example is Amazon’s data centers has provided heat to a biosphere project in downtown Seattle. Bitcoin mining facilities use a vast array of different techniques to acquire cheap electricity and some of them with the environment in mind. Some mining operations use burning cheap coal in plants to more greener energy solutions like hydropower. There are quite a few mining facilities located in Iceland because operations make use of the cold air and geothermal steam power plants located within the region.  In China’s Tibetan highlands, mining operations within the region are using hydropower to offset electrical costs. Located close to the city of Kangding, the mining company HaoBTC has been using a hydroelectric power plant for cheaper electricity while at the same time treating the environment better. The idea is a far greener energy solution in contrast to the coal plants powering bitcoin mines located near the northern Inner Mongolia province. There’s a lot of discussion about bitcoin’s consumption of energy. Some believe there will be the need for more hydropower plants that can produce 1,000-10,000 megawatts per plant. Others believe, in the future, bitcoin mining may even go nuclear utilizing its energy resource of 7,000 to 10,000 megawatts per energy station. It’s also worth noting that all payment systems require consuming energy whether it be storage, moving physical assets, operating software and more. All of the world’s concepts of payment processing come with costs and energy consumption. However, even in its early years, bitcoin mining is showing that operators are already practicing greener energy solutions. Alongside this, some miners are learning to use the heat mining provides for other uses cases. At the exponential rate bitcoin mining is growing in the future we may see many more techniques that harness bitcoin minings energy and power in a much more useful way. For now this power is one of bitcoin’s greatest security advantages and should continue to blossom. What do you think about bitcoin’s energy consumption and the unique methods of harnessing this power for other benefits? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-13T19:00:52-04:00,German TV Channel Says Bitcoin Is “Digital Gold”,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/german-tv-channel-says-bitcoin-is-digital-gold/,"One of Germany’s oldest and most well known publicly owned television channels Das Erste recently aired a full featured news report on bitcoin, referring to the cryptocurrency as “digital gold.” Also read: Bitstamp Tries the Crowdfunding Route at $60 Million Valuation In a recently broadcast television show a Das Erste reporter provides an in-depth description of the innovative digital currency bitcoin. After a summary of bitcoin, the episode sees the news reporter travel to the Cryptoanarchy Institute in Paralelní Polis meeting Martijn Wismeijer, a marketing manager at General Bytes. Martijn Wismeijer is well known for his bio-chip implanted bitcoin wallet and shows the news correspondent how it works. “I’ve had a chip implant, since 2014,” explains Wismeijer purchasing a Red Bull using the NFC bitcoin wallet in his hand. “You can hardly see it, but here is the antenna, next to the chip. If I want to buy, I just wave my hand at the checkout or the machine over there.” After getting an energy drink from the machine using bitcoin Wismeijer tells the reporter “this is the future.” The General Bytes manager explains that bitcoin doesn’t rely on a third party and traditional bank accounts are not necessary. Wismeijer notes, “Banks will always be there, but with bitcoin, you have a choice for the first time in history!” It’s the first digital currency of it’s kind that no longer needs banks. The broadcast goes on to detail how the cryptocurrency is generated through mining and the securitization of network transactions. The show explains rewards, mining difficulty fixed into the software, and how mining competition is growing significantly. An interesting take-away from the video is that mining is often referred to as “digging” similarly to gold mining. The reporter explains:   Following a brief explanation of why bitcoin may be a new form of digital gold, the German reporter travels to Iceland to visit with Marco Streng of the firm Genesis Mining. Streng gives the journalist a tour of the company’s Iceland mining farm that utilizes geothermal power plants and low-cost electricity from the region’s hot springs. When entering the Genesis-owned mining facility, the Das Erste correspondent exclaims, “My God, how many machines are there?” Streng responds stating: Moreover, the mining farm’s electricity costs one million euros per month says, Streng. However, the facility’s owner chose not to disclose how many bitcoins they were earning daily. “If I told you this, all of our competitors would immediately be able to draw a conclusion on how big we are, which would, of course, bring a play-theoretical advantage.” Streng details that there are significant advantages to operating a mine in Iceland. This includes water steam systems, and the cold air within the region helps the mine a great deal. The German report provides an excellent description of certain aspects of the decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin. It’s good to see mainstream media delve into researching and learning about this growing bitcoin economy. The featured broadcast ends with Streng detailing to the Das Erste journalist that as the world experiences financial turmoil bitcoin will only rise. “What makes Bitcoin what it is, is this independence from the financial world,” Streng adds.

2017-01-13T15:00:55-04:00,Bitcoin is Becoming a De Facto World Currency,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-becoming-the-de-facto-world-currency/,"Bitcoin is becoming a world currency. Credibility and safe-haven currency functionality are some of the sine qua non features of a world currency. Signs corroborating that Bitcoin exhibits these two features are appearing more frequently and in ever more significant use-cases. Also read: One of These 5 Hyperinflating Economies Could Adopt Bitcoin in 2017 Recently, The People’s Bank of China added to Bitcoin’s credibility by meeting with the executives of the largest Bitcoin exchange platform in China. In effect, officials from The People’s Bank of China met with BTCC on January 6, 2017. The purpose of the meeting was to “urge rational investment in Bitcoin,” Reuters reported. However, most importantly, the meeting demonstrated that authorities at The People’s Bank of China consider Bitcoin trading a proper business endeavor. Commenting on the BTCC-The People’s Bank of China meeting, a Reddit user, vapor114, wrote, “China just did BTC a favor in acknowledging that the exchanges are legitimate businesses that the gov’t recognizes.” Moreover, this was not the first time that BTCC met with bank authorities. A statement from BTCC reads, “BTCC regularly meets with the People’s Bank of China and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations of China.” Policies on demonetization, signs of inflation, isolationist trends from the UK and the US, and the threat of trade wars with China and other big US business partners are just some of the factors that will test or are already testing Bitcoin’s capacity to function as a safe-haven currency. Investors move to safe-haven currencies when they want to minimize the risk of losing wealth through the eroding effects of inflation and economic uncertainty. Recent events demonstrate that investors are using Bitcoin as a safe-haven in China. As we have seen, fluctuations of Bitcoin’s value are inversely related to the value of the yuan. Bitcoin has been surging as Chinese investors have been buying bitcoins to hedge against the declining yuan. On the other hand, when the yuan soars, investors stop buying bitcoins. For example, this happened on January 5, 2017 and caused Bitcoin’s value to retrace over 20 percent from a three-year peak of $1,139. Signs of inflation are showing up globally, fueling investors and businesses’ appetite for the cryptocurrency. Argentina has suffered from high inflation for decades; it was, not surprisingly, one of the earliest adopters of Bitcoin. Now, Venezuela is rapidly adopting Bitcoin. As a galloping inflation erodes the Bolivar, the cryptocurrency is coming to the rescue. For instance, a travel agency, Destinia, no longer accept Bolivars. Explicitly, a press release of December 23, 2016, states, “Destinia decides to operate exclusively in Bitcoins in Venezuela.” The question now is what role Bitcoin will play if inflation shows up in the economies of developed countries, such as the US and Eurozone, where pressures to increase prices are also popping up. In the US, the Federal Reserve acknowledges that inflation increased in 2016, although it is still below the Fed’s objective of 2 percent. Nevertheless, the Fed worries about inflationary pressures that policies from the upcoming administration could generate. “Asset price movements, as well as changes in the expected path for U.S. monetary policy beyond December, appeared to be driven largely by expectations of more expansionary fiscal policy in the aftermath of U.S. elections,” states the Fed Minutes of December 2016. Similarly, in the Eurozone, inflation is increasing. The annual inflation rate reached 1.1 percent in December 2016, which represents an increase of 0.6 percent from November 2016, according to Eurostat. This rate of inflation is the highest since September 2013, reports CNBC. Isolationism, demonetization, and political uncertainty are driving investors to buy bitcoins to shelter their wealth. For example, Bitcoin’s value went up because of the uncertainty Brexit’s upheaval created. Additionally, Fiat currency flaws have caused governments to demonetize their economies, which in turn, have triggered an increase in Bitcoin’s users as well as its Bitcoin value, as is the case in Venezuela and India. Indeed, as governments increase monetary restrictions, people use bitcoins to protect their capital and to move money across borders. In this regard, Gil Luria, Director of Research at Wedbush Securities, told the New York Times, “The more there is an expectation for new barriers to be erected, the more there is an expectation that Bitcoin will be valuable for moving money across borders.” Each of these events strengthens Bitcoin’s path to prominence as a world currency. Additionally, as Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC, predicts, “Bitcoin can serve as reserve for digital currencies globally.”  Moreover, says Lee, “Bitcoin’s blockchain can be the global anchor (proof-of-work chain) for all nationally created digital currencies.” What do you think about Bitcoin becoming a world currency?

The company spent the last six months testing the trades, Simonetti told Bitcoin.com.  Through this partnership, users can convert bitcoin into Euro and withdraw cash from any bank ATMs that are part of the Halcash’s network in Spain and Poland. There are currently 7,000 Halcash ATMs in Spain and 4,500 in Poland, Simonetti said. Holytransaction also provides a prepaid virtual Visa card that can be loaded with bitcoin through the Trade app and used to make purchases online, anywhere that accepts a Visa card. For buying bitcoin, Simonetti explained that there are 500 ATMs available in Greece to buy bitcoin as well as over 10,000 retail stores available through the Paynet network including 7Eleven and Circle K. In addition, Holytransaction has also partnered with Teleingreso, Spanish payment option that allows users to buy bitcoin through its network of more than 3000 ATMs, 2000 post offices, and 300 retail outlets. “When you select Teleingreso as an online payment method, the system automatically generates a unique 9-digit transaction code,” states Holytransaction’s press release. “The transaction is pending until you visit any of the locations to make a payment, and then the information is instantly provided to us.” At the moment the application is available on Google Play as well as online. The company plans to release the iOS version next month.

Bitcoin.com caught up with Kagayaki Kawabata, Coincheck’s Business Development Lead to discuss the achievements. Also read: Japanese Can Soon Pay Utility Bills with Bitcoin “Our exchange’s user base has surged in past few months,” Kawabata told Bitcoin.com this week. “Last April we only had around 14,000 users,” he continued, adding that now “We have around 76,400 users and still increasing.” A major factor contributing to the significant rise in Coincheck‘s user base that Kawabata referenced is an announcement in Nikkei at the beginning of this year stating that 2017 is the year of cryptocurrency. Since Nikkei is the most popular national newspaper, his exchange has greatly benefited resulting in an influx of the number of registered users. He noted: With over 445 percent or a 5.45x increase in users within less than a year, the exchange’s transaction volume subsequently rose significantly. “We now have over 130 million USD monthly transaction volume,” he revealed, adding that the volume spiked around November. Before the spike, the exchange had an average of between $50-100 million monthly transaction volume. Since bitcoin’s price reached an all-time high, coupled with positive media broadcasting and growing public awareness, a wide-range of people have been registering for services at Coincheck, from college students to elderly, Kawabata described. Last November, Coincheck launched an initiative called Coincheck Denki which allows the Japanese to pay their electric bills using bitcoin. Today there are approximately 200 subscribers for the service. The company believes that “this number will increase this year dramatically.” The company’s bitcoin payment service is also growing. “We have able to develop Coincheck payment’s market awareness where general public identifies Coincheck as the No 1. bitcoin payment processor in Japan,” Kawabata said, adding that “99% of bitcoin payment in Japan use Coincheck payment.” Many type of merchants use Coincheck’s payment service to accept bitcoins including restaurants, bars, pawn shop, cosmetics, nail salons, hair salons, and e-commerce sites. Today, more than 5,000 merchants and websites accept bitcoin through Coincheck. Kawabata revealed: The company ensures that its payment installation process is as simple as possible allowing anyone to start accepting bitcoin just by installing an app to their device. “Our service simplicity strongly helped merchant bitcoin payment adoption,” he believes, adding that “We think the merchants adopting bitcoin will accelerate this year surpassing last year’s growth rate.” What do you think of Coincheck’s achievements?

2017-01-12T06:00:50-04:00,Needham: Probability of Approval for a Bitcoin ETF ‘Very Low’,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/needham-probability-of-approval-for-a-bitcoin-etf-very-low/,"Needham & Company, an independent investment bank and asset management firm, released today a mini investors’ report on the prospect of a Bitcoin ETF in 2017. The company currently hands Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust (GBTC) with a ‘Hold’ rating. Report author, Spencer Bogart, detailed the upside potential of a bitcoin ETF being approved and discussed the probability of approval. Also read: SEC Delays Decision on SolidX Bitcoin Trust  Needham specializes in advisory services and financings for growth companies. Since its inception, Needham has acted as lead or co-manager in over 785 public offerings. The firm has also been an agent on more than 115 private placements, and completed over 385 mergers and acquisitions. Together, these transactions total over $200 billion. “We think the listing of a bitcoin ETF would have a profound effect on the price of bitcoin,” Needham’s report reads, adding that: Citing the resemblance of an average daily trading volume of bitcoin to the average security in the S&P midcap 400, Needham believes it would be hard for the ETF to acquire $300 million worth of bitcoin without pushing up the price substantially. If a bitcoin ETF is approved, this effect would also be amplified because “providers will be simultaneously pulling available liquidity from order books,” the report reads. Overall, Needham believes that “the positive effect that a bitcoin ETF would have on the price of bitcoin is vastly underappreciated.” Not only there would be an inflow of assets, but “favorable shifts in perception and regulatory risk would be at least as significant for driving price higher.” The approval by the SEC, and subsequently, a bitcoin mainstream investment vehicle “would add legitimacy to bitcoin in the eyes of investors” and expose bitcoin to a larger percentage of people. While there is a tremendous upside potential for bitcoin, the probability of approval is “very low” and “drastically overestimated,” Needham wrote. While difficult to quantify, the firm estimates the probability to be “sub-25%.” The report cites the reason for not approving: However, there is also a possibility of the SEC doing nothing by the deadline. In this case, “the proposed rule change is automatically approved,” Needham explained, adding that this will improve the chance of a bitcoin ETF being approved. This is because “politically, it might be easier for the individuals responsible for making the decision to let the decision go to auto-approval,” meaning there is no reason to disapprove instead of sticking a stamp of approval on the listing. Regardless of whether a bitcoin ETF is approved or not, the report concludes: Do you think the SEC will approve any Bitcoin ETFs? Let us know in the comments section below.

The company is paying bitcoin for quick video reviews of locations and events. Bitcoin.com talked to Thomas Olson, Vevue founder, to discuss his latest venture. Also read: New Image Hosting Service Pays Thousands of Uploaders in Bitcoin  Previously launched as an Ethereum ‘Dapp’ which had users collecting “Vevue equity tokens”, now Vevue has de-cluttered their offering and relaunched with a focus on allowing users to earn and spend only bitcoins. The project originally began in 2014, launching an alpha version with tokens in the summer of 2016. Vevue now allows users to request (requesters) any videos of any place or events such as restaurants or landmarks by pinning them to a map, and place a bitcoin bounty on them. “Anyone can also fund their account with Bitcoin and pin Bitcoin to the map asking for videos,” Olson told Bitcoin.com. Then, other app users (recorders) can take videos of the subject, uploading it into Vevue and claim the bounty. However, “The only way to earn Bitcoin is by answering an already pinned Request from the map,” Olson added.  To ensure everyone gets paid, while the app is new and there are not many users requesting videos yet, the company is taking it upon itself to pin requests for users to answer. Olson said: “Currently each video is paid for out of pocket,” according to Olson. He then described how he uses revenues from his eBay business to fund Vevue development. “My budget for Beta testing is 6 BTC. 1 BTC spent creating Requests at 5 Bits. Then 5 BTC spent working with those creating quality content,” he revealed. The startup is offering one bit (0.00000100) per video posted, or 100 bits for high-quality videos if you get approval for it in advance. The minimum withdrawal amount is set to 100 bits, according to the company’s blog. “We’re looking to find individuals to upload quality videos following the message instructions attached to each Request.

2017-01-11T10:00:33-04:00,Chinese Bitcoin Exchange Inspections Cause Price Drop and FUD,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinese-bitcoin-exchange-inspections-cause-price-drop-and-fud/,"News from China is once again spreading through the bitcoin world like wildfire. It appears China’s central bank the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) is visiting with the top three Chinese exchanges and assessing each companies operations. Per usual on negative rumors from China the price of bitcoin took a dive during the early hours of January 11 dropping another 15 percent to a low of US$790. Also read: Price Reports and Tales From China-Dizzy Bitcoiners China’s central bank is currently monitoring and assessing the Chinese exchanges Huobi, Okcoin, and BTCC according to a press release from the institution. The news follows last week’s announcement that these regulatory assessments would be taking place. Reuters details the bank is looking into capital flight and anti-money laundering practices amongst other discussions like “market manipulation.” “The People’s Bank of China Shanghai headquarters, the Shanghai Municipal Finance Office and other units to form a joint inspection team on Bitcoin China are carrying out on-site inspections,” explains the PBOC press release. “Focusing on checking whether the scope of the enterprise beyond the scope of the market, operation, whether or not without a license to carry out credit, payment, exchange and other related business; whether there is market manipulation; anti-money laundering system implementation; financial security risks and so on.”  As soon as the news hit the ears of the cryptocurrency community the price of bitcoin starting dropping after reaching a high of $925 late in the evening January 10. Furthermore, news outlets covering the subject were quick on the draw to release stories concerning the Chinese inspections. News reports from Reuters, Yahoo Finance, the Globe & Mail, Zerohedge and many others gave details about the situation. Additionally, many cryptocurrency-centric publications also spun off stories with some of them being a bit misleading.  According to the press releases originating from Shanghai and Beijing, the inspection is merely a typical regulatory oversight. The bitcoin exchange BTCC has been the most vocal about the situation once again reaffirming the meetings were nothing to worry about. The Chinese exchange details the cryptocurrency community should use rational thinking rather than depend on speculative news sources. BTCC states via the company’s Twitter handle:   Time and time again fear, uncertainty, and doubt has shaken up some within the bitcoin crowd. Many are leaning towards the speculation that the Chinese government is trying to curb capital flight and tighten the offshore yuan market. The price of bitcoin has sunk to new lows but is slowly rebounding in an upward trend back to $815 at press time. There has been a lot of shorting within the trading community, and many members of the Whale Club expected the bearish decline. The news from China and rumors from the region is nothing new within the bitcoin community as these events have happened regularly since the cryptocurrency’s beginnings. Speculation and the game of telephone is a common occurrence for bitcoiners and is only human nature. The bottom line is the ‘Honeybadger of Money’ just doesn’t care and it’s just another day in bitcoin-land. What do you think about the announcement from the PBOC and BTCC’s follow up responses? Do you think Chinese news has caused the price to drop? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Shutterstock, and Bitcoin.com.

2017-01-11T06:00:20-04:00,Did Julian Assange Just Use the Bitcoin Blockchain to Prove He Is Alive?,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/did-julian-assange-just-use-the-bitcoin-blockchain-to-prove-he-is-alive/,"Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks editor-in-chief, read yesterday the bitcoin blockchain hash of block 447506 during a recorded video. At the time, it represented the most recent bitcoin block published to the blockchain. Experts contend this is proof that Mr. Assange is alive – or at least that the video, in which the whistleblower appears uncoerced, was not pre-recorded.  Also Read: WikiLeaks Has Raised 4,000+ BTC Since 2011  There had been some speculation that Mr. Assange was dead or lost control of his online identity. Instead of holding up today’s newspaper, as might have happened historically, the Australia-native used the blockchain technology to prove he is alive, contained at the Ecuadorian embassy. He referred to it as “proof of life.” As a public cryptographic ledger, the bitcoin blockchain allows anyone to “mine” and add pieces of information (known as ‘blocks’) to the blockchain, but only upon completing a computer process known as “proof of work”.  Bitcoin’s hash algorithm, known as SHA256, scrambles data stored in the blocks (in the case of bitcoin, mostly transaction data) into a string of letters and numbers referred to as a hash. Knowing what data went into creating a hash is very hard. However, it is very easy to determine the hash of a particular piece of data.  A bitcoin block hash represents a random group of letters and number virtually impossible to predict. Once distributed via the blockchain, however, the hash is widely available and cannot be altered. By reading the most recently published block hash, Mr. Assange could prove today’s interview had not been pre-recorded.  When WikiLeaks released a trove of U.S. diplomatic cables in November 2010, the non-profit lost access to the banking system on December 7, 2010. Since Bank of America, Visa, Mastercard and PayPal stopped serving Wikileaks, the group – known for aiding in the Chelsea Manning leaks – began accepting bitcoin. WikiLeaks offers private bitcoin addresses for larger donations, so it’s tough to know how many bitcoins the service has received. Through 626 days of the financial blockade in August 2012, as reported by Jon Matonis for Forbes, Wikileaks had received (on just its public bitcoin address) more than $32,000 equivalent in over 1,100 separate bitcoin donations. 1BTC was worth $10 at that time.  As of November 30, 2016, WikiLeaks had raised 4,000 bitcoin since 2011. The address received its 4,000th bitcoin in December 2016. In September of 2014 during a Reddit AMA, Assange spoke highly of the bitcoin blockchain:  In his book, Mr. Assange allegedly details the process by which WikiLeaks came to accepting bitcoin donations, including discussions on forums with the pseudonymous founder of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto, who wrote: The project needs to grow gradually so the software can be strengthened along the way. I make this appeal to WikiLeaks not to try to use bitcoin. Bitcoin is a small beta community in its infancy. You would not stand to get more than pocket change, and the heat you would bring would likely destroy us at this stage. Indeed, WikiLeaks heeded the advice of Satoshi Nakamoto. Assange states that “WikiLeaks read and agreed with Satoshi’s analysis, and decided to put off the launch of a Bitcoin donation channel until the currency had become more established.” During the interview recorded today, Mr. Assange did not seem to be under duress. He implored viewers, however, not to take this as a sign that everything’s coming up roses. “Don’t take some cryptographic proof as evidence that I am OK,” Mr. Assange said. “I’m not, I have been held here for 8 years. I haven’t been OK the entire time.” What do you think about Julian Assange’s ‘proof of life’ interview? Let us know in the comments below. Images via Shutterstock, Twitter, and Pixabay.

2017-01-10T19:00:42-04:00,US Municipalities Hesistant on Bitcoin,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/us-municipalities-hesistant-on-bitcoin/,"While the city of Zug, Switzerland, begins testing bitcoin payments, municipalities in the U.S. still see bitcoin as high risk with little reward. They’ve had the option to accept bitcoin for city services for four years thanks to a forward-thinking Ohio company. Yet, not one has updated their online payment methods. Also Read: Switzerland’s SBB Railway Offers Bitcoin At 1,000 Kiosks  Citizen service provider E-Gov Link, which announced bitcoin integration in March 2013 (mere weeks after FinCEN released its first guidance), has yet to onboard a single bitcoin-accepting municipality. Not one.  The company, which is the only major provider of municipal software integrating bitcoin payments, has fielded only “a handful of calls from municipalities that specifically expressed interest,” according to CEO and founder Jerry Felix. E-Gov Link allows individuals to pay utility bills, parking fines, registrations for class, and a litany of city services online. When the Cincinnati company started accepting the digital currency, bitcoin had a market value of approximately $95 per bitcoin and a market capitalization of more than one billion. The price of Bitcoin currently is $920, and the market capitalization approximately $16 billion.  E-Gov Link’s core clients include municipalities of 5,000-70,000 inhabitants in more than 60% of US states, believes there are several reasons why not one municipality in the US has experimented with bitcoin. “Municipal government is by nature conservative,” reasons Mr. Felix, who bought E-Gov Link. “[Representatives] are entrusted with the public’s money and they don’t want to mess it up. That is where they get yelled at at public meetings, voted out of office or administrators get fired. Municipal representatives like some innovation, but don’t want to go too far out on a limb. Bitcoin is perceived as high risk, low reward, and citizens aren’t asking for it.” Why might a local government begin accepting bitcoin? “The main reason a municipality would accept bitcoin is to show they were innovators,” Mr. Felix surmises, which echoes statements made by Zug’s mayor regarding its bitcoin experiment. “But, government doesn’t have that motivation. Whereas private businesses compete with each other, governments are not competing to show they are cutting edge. There is some resistance also due to the generation of people running government.” Some in government have shown interest, Mr. Felix assures, like one communications director in a certain Ohio municipality, who couldn’t convince his finance department to accept bitcoin.  “What we have been doing is informing officials about bitcoin, and the fact that though there is volatility, they don’t need to hold bitcoin,” Mr. Felix says, whose platform allows clients to accept bitcoin via payment processors BitPay or Coinbase.  Nikhil Chand, a consultant on the Cleveland Heights bitcoin boulevard project in Ohio, knows a thing or two about working with regulators. He saw first hand how Ohio Department of Public Safety forbade Ohioans from paying for beer, wine, or liquor with bitcoin.  “Regulators aren’t going to devote time to something that seems irrelevant or off the radar,” Mr. Chand told Bitcoin.com. “Many in the Bitcoin community hope regulators stay far, far away from it, actually. Small businesses which require regulatory licensing to operate, like as a liquor store, aren’t going to take the risk in interpreting current law. They want explicit guidance.” He adds: “If regulators are slow to respond, the financial industry will do what it usually does – calculate if the potential profitability of deploying a blockchain solution is higher than any potential fines or jail time, and execute accordingly.” “We are progressive enough to stay on top of the leading technologies,” Mr. Felix said. “We’re not sitting back on old technologies. We provide what are called ‘best in class solutions’, whether we build them or license them from other providers. When we are building websites for people, we use the leading content management system, WordPress. We integrated bitcoin because it’s the market leading digital currency, and it still is.” Mr. Felix adds: “I think local governments want to be second to implement bitcoin payments, but are hesitant to be first. Especially when it comes to money and accountability to citizens.”  With Zug having announced its bitcoin testing, now could be time for a US municipality (say, in Silicon Valley) to do the same.

2017-01-10T15:00:55-04:00,Polish Bitcoin Adoption Escalating with Strong Ecosystem,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/polish-bitcoin-adoption-escalating-with-strong-ecosystem/,"Poland is one of the biggest bitcoin markets that gets the least amount of coverage in the English-speaking press, despite their currency typically ranking in the top-10 for bitcoin trades globally. Bitcoin.com interviewed Michal Dziedzic, Business Development Director for Bitmarket.pl, one of Poland’s largest bitcoin exchanges. Also read: Polish Gov’t ‘Highly Interested’ in Bitcoin, Meets with Local Community  Bitmarket hosts around 45% of the daily volume of trades between bitcoin and the Polish Zloty. The exchange is run by the creators of the largest domain marketplace in Central Europe, AfterMarket.pl, and offers live Bitcoin and Litecoin trading, with margin trading up to x10. They also coordinate donation drives in bitcoin for charities and offer a daily price guessing jackpot game on their website. Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you describe the bitcoin ecosystem in Poland? Michal Dziedzic (MD): We have a small but great internal eco-system. We have merchants who accept payments; we have exchanges and a company (InPay.pl) which connect bitcoin users to merchants, allowing them to pay their bills using bitcoins. There are also some bitcoin miners here who have rigs over tens of MWatts power consumption. BC: Can you explain which is growing faster – bitcoin as a payment method or bitcoin as an investment? MD: The amount of merchants who are accepting bitcoin is slowly but steadily increasing in our country. Over the past few months the Polish Zloty has depreciated against currencies like USD or EUR, therefore, bitcoin has become a great store of value for some users and I think this was lately really important. There is a big variety of the people who are interested in bitcoin as an investment – some of them are just buying them and keep “for a better time” and some are typical traders for whom bitcoin has become a way to earn money on a monthly basis. There is not really much of a difference if you compare our users to the rest of the world. BC: Poland has long been one of the top-10 countries for bitcoin volumes worldwide. Can you describe how bitcoin adoption is coming along there? MD: Yes, it is true that the bitcoin scene in Poland is quite big if you compare the number of citizens to our volume. I believe that the main reason why not many foreign users had heard about us is that exchanges like Kraken or Bitstamp were created from beginning to operate in EUR or USD markets /BTC, but our main target has been the BTC/PLN (Polish Zloty) pair (obviously there is also additionally EUR/PLN). Nevertheless, some of our foreign customers (they use EUR) are happy with our service, the most being in PLN, and we hope that our growth in this sector will continue. One important thing is the EUR market has got a relevant depth to our main PLN market (we use FX transposition of PLN into EUR market). The increase in bitcoin’s price is definitely helping – thanks to this we have a bigger attention of the media hence we begin to notice that more and more new users from Poland are making their first steps into the world of digital currencies and usually they start from registering on our exchange. Personally, I see a really huge difference if we go back in time. When I was starting my adventure with Bitcoin as a student a few years ago while writing my thesis about it not many people have heard about it – there was basically no media coverage at the time. Now the bitcoin community is much bigger and it is really easy to obtain information about digital currencies. BC: What are the obstacles to bitcoin adoption there? MD: I think the obstacles are the same as in other countries. Lots of people basically don’t know what bitcoin is and they are afraid to use it. Sometimes media coverage is also negative – old convictions that bitcoin is being used for criminal activity and money laundry which were made a few years ago are still used even though a lot has changed over the past years. We also hope that the banks will be more friendly when it comes to the partnership with bitcoin companies. The current policy of some Polish banks is to denounce the bank accounts agreements for businesses involved in the services for the cryptocurrency market. That’s why lately we have been forced to change the bank and the new system of bank accounts. BC: What does the Polish government say about bitcoin? MD: Bitcoin and other digital currencies have not been defined in our law system yet therefore sometimes it’s causing some issues when it comes to dealing with bitcoin on a large scale. What is promising is that our government wants to change things – we will see whether for better or worse but we believe that everything will be more transparent soon. In 2016 The Ministry of Digital Affairs became interested in Bitcoin – currently they are working with a group of blockchain/bitcoin companies & specialist (amongst them is our exchange). The goal is to properly legitimize and regulate bitcoin in order to improve bitcoin adoption in Poland. BC: How fast are you expecting Bitcoin adoption to grow going forward? MD: I would like to think that this is just the beginning of a great and long journey. Over the past years there has been a tremendous growth in bitcoin popularity – just look how many new bitcoin/blockchain companies have been created. If nothing bad happens and the governments see the potential of this technology, it’s safe to say that bitcoin’s future looks really promising. What do you think of the Polish bitcoin scene?

2017-01-10T12:00:09-04:00,Mainstream Media Should Research Before Publishing Bitcoin Reports,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/mainstream-media-research-bitcoin/,"Since bitcoin’s significant price rise over the past couple of months, the digital asset has gained attention from the mainstream media. Lots of them have been quite optimistic and have described the cryptocurrency in a positive light. However, just recently a couple of mainstream publications have tried once again to downplay bitcoin existence. Also Read: Death & Bitcoin: How I Prepared My Family’s Digital Inheritance Mainstream media has always had shtick against the decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin. In the early days, you could find article after article detailing the digital assets imminent death. However, when reading these opinionated editorials, you can see quite a bit of confirmation bias, lack of research, and overall stupidity. Just recently two mainstream publications the Financial Times (FT) and Time Magazine have published two negative articles covering the recent bitcoin price rise. The first editorial written by FT called “Bitcoin passes $1,000 but the only number that matters is zero” basically states the cryptocurrency is worthless. The article in question compares the bitcoin economy in contrast to other larger markets worldwide. To the author these traditional settlement markets manage to put the sum of bitcoin transactions “to zero.” Furthermore, the FT writer describes bitcoin as a significantly sized pyramid scheme or Ponzi. “As a phenomenon bitcoin has all the attributes of a pyramid scheme, requiring a constant influx of converts to push up the price, based on the promise of its use by future converts,” explains the FT article. “So the ultimate value for bitcoin will be the same as all pyramid schemes: zero.” It seems the author has a great misunderstanding towards the bitcoin protocol and community. The truth is bitcoin has been called a Ponzi by many mainstream media publications and has been debunked each and every time. Even the World Bank Group has refuted this claim by saying, “contrary to a widely-held opinion, Bitcoin is not a deliberate Ponzi. And there is little to learn by treating it as such.” Additionally, there’s no requirement to convert people to bitcoin. The fact is the cryptocurrency is rising due to natural supply and demand and the ill effects of centrally planned monetary policy, fractional reserve banking, manipulated interest rates, demonetization, hyperinflation, and devalued currencies. These are the real reasons people are investing in bitcoin.     On January 5 the publication Time Magazine published a post called “Why You Shouldn’t Invest in Bitcoin.” This particular editorial describes bitcoin as an extremely volatile currency without observing the fact that the nation states currencies and commodities often fluctuate as well. However, the author does recognize that bitcoin has had more than a 100% return over the past year. Yet the publication quotes Campbell Harvey, a professor of finance at Duke University who says bitcoin is “an extremely risky investment.” Alongside this, the professor says if one is to obtain bitcoin for their portfolio to invest very minimally. “I would never recommend this on a stand-alone basis,” Harvey explains. On the other hand, the Duke professor says citizens living abroad in nations such as Venezuela and China are using it to escape capital controls and cash shortages. Harvey’s opinion says bitcoin’s recent rise is due to these geopolitical environments. Many bitcoiners will tell you that bitcoin is not an investment vehicle and should not be described in such a way. Surely there will always be some people who believe that it is and use it as such. However, in many people’s opinions, bitcoin is merely a financial tool that helps people within the heavily manipulated economies worldwide. It overcomes capital controls, it’s censorship resistant, it costs way less than traditional processors, but more importantly puts wealth back into the hands of the individual.  Mainstream media and these writers have a hard time conceptualizing these attributes. But usually, it’s because these reporters spin off stories with very little understanding of the very subject they write about. It’s entirely possible that journalists such as the FT reporter had just heard about bitcoin and its dramatic price increase and think they are coming up with an ‘original’ argument. The bottom line is with a lack of research a report on bitcoin being a bad investment isn’t well thought out. Even though most bitcoiners will say it is not an investment, bitcoin has outperformed most fiat currencies every year except for 2014. Lastly, without much study, someone could assume the cryptocurrency is a Ponzi, but if they researched more, they would find there is literally ‘zero’ evidence of this opinion.

2017-01-10T08:00:17-04:00,China’s Smart Money is Staying in Bitcoin This Time,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/chinas-smart-money-staying-bitcoin/,"Also Read: Price Reports And Tales from China Dizzy Bitcoiners What’s more, the veteran Chinese-based bitcoin trader observes, the smart money seems to be staying in bitcoin. The demand picked up over the summer, around the time of the bitcoin halving. Ryan says the trading desk he oversees has seen an increase of  70% in business growth month-over-month for the last three to six months. “It is a bit surprising we’ve had this type of growth persist at this level, ” the experienced trader says. Though he has seen institutional smart money come and go, Ryan notices that – this time – the trend is persistent. “It’s been a very consistent trend over the last year,” he says. “Larger traders and position takers have entered into the market.” By now it’s no secret wealthy Chinese investors use bitcoin to get bitcoin out of the country as the Chinese government and regulators restrict the outflow of capital and limit the purchase of insurance and real estate abroad. As Beijing reportedly struggles to manage yuan depreciation, and the nation’s reserve to sink to new lows, smart money in China has entered into the digital asset space, which is led by the digital currency bitcoin.   China and bitcoin have seem inextricably linked since the digital currency’s release in January 2009. 90% of bitcoin trade takes place in China, and a robust network of miners, thanks to inexpensive electricity and hardware in the country of 1.35 billion, has made the nation a bitcoin epicenter.  “China is of course on the forefront in digital payments and sort of migrating over to a cashless society,” Ryan reasons. “The growth of cashless payments here is extreme.”  Seeing bitcoin as a safehaven, Feng Xin’an, 43-year-old sales manager with Shanghai-based Maoxin Trade Ltd, claimed to have invested approximately 135,000 yuan ($19,515) into the bitcoin market. “The young generation, like my son and his friends, love to pay with digital currencies,” he told China Daily. Demand for bitcoin is largely credited with driving the price to near record highs throughout 2016. Throughout last year, as China implemented capital outflow controls, demand increased for bitcoin. The People’s Bank of China Shanghai Head Office made a statement late Friday about bitcoin, calling the volatility in the digital currency “abnormal” and advising companies operating in the country on bitcoin-related business conduct, including limitations on marketing and discussion of the yuan’s decline. BTCC, popular bitcoin services company based in China, stated the PBOC wanted to warn of the “significant volatility in bitcoin trading, and also quoted  from a notice released in 2013 saying that bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status.”  According to BTCC’s release, the mining company “regularly meets with the People’s Bank of China, and we work closely with them to ensure that we are operating in accordance with the laws and regulations in China.” Beijing-based business and finance publication, Caixin stated of the PBOC release: “…[T]he two [Bitcoin] trading platforms in Beijing were required to comply with central bank requirements and were told that the promotion should not mention the depreciation of the yuan.” In late November, the Wall Street Journal reported China was having troubles steadying the yuan’s decline. Goldman Sachs discovered in December the real world amount of Chinese FX outflows. Beijing, the US investment bank determined, had disguised how much capital was leaving the country.  Goldman calculated that from August 2015 to November 2016, Chinese FX outflow totaled roughly US $1.1 trillion. The overall data implies China has depleted its reserves faster than PBOC reserve data suggests.  China’s foreign currency holdings declined for the sixth straight month in December. In an attempt to stabilize the yuan, Beijing drained its reserves of $320 billion in 2016, a $41.1 billion decrease. Reserves are at a five-year low of $3.01 trillion, according to the People’s Bank of China on Saturday, just as the institution made it’s bitcoin comments.  China’s reserves have fallen for the past ten quarters from its $4 trillion record peak in June 2014. It’s economic news like this that ensure smart Chinese money enters, and stays, in bitcoin.  The Bitcoin price in Chinese yuan terms reached an all-time high of approximately 8,575 CNY before correcting. At press time, one bitcoin is worth approximately 6,498 CNY. Will western smart money follow institutional money into bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-10T06:00:36-04:00,Venezuelans Turn to Bitcoin to Escape Financial Hardships,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuelans-bitcoin-financial-hardships/,"Venezuela has been suffering from significant economic decline and turbulent markets. Many worldwide and residents of the region blame the country’s socialist government and centrally planned economic choices. Over the past few months, it’s been reported quite frequently that Venezuelan citizens have been finding financial relief by utilizing the decentralized cryptocurrency bitcoin. Bitcoin.com decided to reach out to Jorge Farias from the bitcoin company Cryptobuyer.io and the consulting agency Coincox to confirm these stories. Farias details how economic hardships are affecting Venezuelan residents and lots of them are in fact utilizing bitcoin. Many Venezuelans are finding profits in bitcoin mining, using the currency to purchase food and medicine, and improving their lives greatly by giving residents the tool they need to overcome these economic afflictions. Also read: Workers Who Travel Internationally Will Benefit from Bitcoin         Bitcoin.com (BC): How did you hear about and get involved with Bitcoin? Jorge Farias (JF): I got involved just after the first Bitcoin halving in 2013. I read the Satoshi Nakamoto white paper, and this was an epiphany. A new economic system with almost no limits had been born. BC: Can you tell our readers about Coincox.com?   JF: Coincox.com is the only Venezuelan blockchain consulting firm focused on companies and institutions interested in bolstering the technology to improve processes such as intellectual property registration. We are working on projects with two banks and two Law firms, and want to expand our operations in Latin America. BC: Can you tell us how Venezuela’s economic hardships are affecting the average citizen? JF: In many ways, not only the middle class, but all levels of the society are fighting against food shortages and rising crime rates. Currently, the government is deploying a system to control food delivery by using QR codes and fingerprint identification; this might be the final step to fully controlled communist state using technology. BC: The Venezuelan currency, the Bolivar, has lost significant value. Can you tell our readers about this?   JF: Venezuela has the record of the highest inflation rate in the world today. The national currency, the Bolivar, lost 20% in one day in December of 2016, after the government ordered the demonetization of the highest bill circulating. BC: Are Venezuelans hearing about the benefits of Bitcoin within the region? JF: In the last few months the bitcoin community here is growing fast. There’s been a rise of the 450 % on searches of the word “Bitcoin” using Google. Localbitcoins operations have doubled in the last year, and our mainstream national media have published articles about the benefits of the underlying technology. For this reason, we launched Cryptobuyer.io, a digital assets platform that is for everyone, not just techies or bitcoiners. [It offers the opportunity] to buy and sell bitcoin using Bolivars. BC: Do you believe a digital asset like Bitcoin can help Venezuelans? JF: Of course, and it is happening. By utilizing Cryptobuyer and others platforms users in Venezuela are online freelancers and starting to accept bitcoin because it’s the only way to get paid without high fees, as most of them used Paypal before, but the money restrictions in Venezuela make it unusable. BC: There have been some headlines about Venezuelans conducting Bitcoin mining operations. Can you tell our readers about this? JF: The electricity cost in Venezuela is subsidized by the state, and this makes more profitable such mining operations. Every day more people are buying miners to operate in the country, but the lack of regulations and sometimes the illegality of related imports are a barrier to starting this kind of business. BC: How do you feel about Venezuelan officials demonetizing its currency by removing certain bolivar denominations?   JF: It is like the government taking money out of your pocket, without any warning, clarification or substitution program. It is another way of social control. BC: What are some ways Venezuelan citizens can obtain bitcoin in your country? JF: Cryptobuyer.io is designed to reach people with almost no knowledge about Bitcoin or cryptocurrencies. It offers mobile phone top-ups, payments towards electricity and cable services, all using bitcoin. Also, our service offers remittance services using national bank transfers in Venezuela thanks to our partnership with a network of Bitcoin ATMs Worldwide. BC: Do you believe the country’s economic turmoil will someday be fixed? JF: Only with a government change or a social collapse. Venezuela gave birth to the greatest South American ever, the liberator of five nations, Simón Bolívar. I hope this gene in our collective biology can wake up and change the things for good, and soon. Thank you, Jorge, for taking the time to explain to our readers what is happening in Venezuela. We hope things change for the good as well and believe bitcoin will benefit citizens worldwide significantly.

A Kickstarter recently combined the age-old way to pass time with what many claims will be the future of money, bitcoin. Also Read: Bitcoin Empire Board Game Kickstarter Bitcoin Empire, a bitcoin-themed board game designed to take advantage of a recent revival in the entertainment medium, has been shipped and should arrive to its fifty Kickstarter backers by January 11, according to its creators. They hope their product will be a modern day equivalent of the economics-themed board game, Monopoly. Created in 1903, Monopoly remains popular to this day. Further, Robert Kiyosaki created a similar game called ‘Cashflow’ for the modern debt-based economy based on the traditional roll-and-move gameplay. A fan of modern board games like Glory to Rome, Letters from Whitechapel and Dominion, Bitcoin Empire co-founder Dave Thomas, along with Ting Yi L., see their card game as an educational opportunity. “We created Bitcoin Empire to educate people about cash flow using modern board gaming mechanics like multi-use cards and hand management, while at the same time introducing bitcoin to a new audience,” explains the Bitcoin Empire co-designer. “Although people’s money exists as numbers on computers in the modern day, the blood, sweat and tears spent to earn that money is very real to people. But, bitcoin remains very unreal. “Few have a real-world association with bitcoin,” Mr. Thomas believes. Media outlets often use the physical coin by defunct startup Casascius Coins as physical representations of bitcoin, for instance, which is probably more a misrepresentation than anything. People playing Bitcoin Empire hold playing cards with the bitcoin logo on the back, using them in a similar way to cash. “Through this simulation of transactions, I can imagine people becoming comfortable with this new paradigm and interested in investing in crypto-currency,” the board game designer reasons. The founders hope their fifty Kickstarter backers introduce their friends and family to Bitcoin via our game. “The core of our game and our Kickstarter campaign was the satirisation of notable Bitcoin events in the mainstream media. For example, Dorian Nakamoto being fingered as Satoshi Nakamoto and the Mt Gox incident,” explains Mr. Thomas. To make the game more appealing to non-bitcoiners, Bitcoin Empire features a secret card featuring Pepe The Frog, Audrey Hepburn, Doge and Jennifer Lawrence. Global sales of games and puzzles grew from $9.3 billion in 2013 to $9.6 billion this year, claims Euromonitor International. Part of this growth is fueled by millennials, one of bitcoin’s leading age demographics. To be sure, bitcoin users have critiqued Bitcoin Empire. “A few of them wished that the gameplay simulated the mining process to help educate people around the technology,” Mr. Thomas divulges. “But we believe that centering the game around the current Bitcoin economy will help highlight the risks of trusting third party banks and exchanges with your money. I think it’s more important to help people take the first step of investing in crypto-currency safely.” Would you play a Bitcoin-themed board game? Let us know in the comments!

2017-01-09T06:00:59-04:00,Ark Invest Reveals New Data on Bitcoin Asset Classification,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/ark-invest-new-data-bitcoin-asset/,"Last summer executives from Ark Invest and Coinbase released a paper called “Bitcoin: Ringing the Bell for a New Asset Class,” which defines the cryptocurrency as a new asset class for the 21st century. The paper written by Ark Invest’s Chris Burniske and Coinbase Vice President Adam White has recently been updated to reflect 2016’s end of the year data. Also read: How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet for Your Needs Ark Invest and the San Francisco startup Coinbase have brought their latest bitcoin report up to date with all kinds of new data. The paper’s authors believe bitcoin is a “first of its kind” type of investment with significant distinctions from traditional assets. Burniske and White explore four criteria within traditional asset classes and use economist Robert Greer’s studies as the reports reference for asset classification. The newly refined report discusses bitcoin amongst traditional assets such as equities, bonds, real estate, precious metals, physical commodities, fine art, and currencies. The four specifications defined in context with cryptocurrency and traditional assets are investability, politico-economics, correlation of returns: price independence, and risk-reward profile. The first section of the report describes bitcoin investability. “ARK Invest and Coinbase define investability as providing ample liquidity and opportunity to invest,” explains the research paper. “Globally, bitcoin exchange traded volumes are a good measure of the liquidity available to investors.— Daily volumes have been increasing steadily, and averaged over $1.5 billion in 2016. During the month of December 2016, average exchange traded volumes were more than $4 billion per day.”  Some new and interesting findings from the updated paper reveal that as of January 2017 Coinbase has stored over a $1 billion USD worth of bitcoin. Ark Invest and Coinbase estimate that more than ten million global citizens hold a portion of bitcoin. As the nascent industry matures the paper’s authors expect these numbers should swell in the future. The paper also explains that trading volume achieved billion dollar daily numbers, bitcoin’s transaction volume has “topped as much as $0.5 billion in one day—and is now consistently north of $200 million daily,” explains Ark Invest. Alongside this, the paper details transactional volume during 2014 through 2016 has seen significant year-over-year growth showing bitcoin’s increased demand. When looking at bitcoin’s correlation of returns or price independence, the paper says the cryptocurrency has significant contrasts to traditional asset classes throughout the past six years. “Bitcoin is the only asset that maintains consistently low correlations with every other asset,” says the research paper.  Lastly, as far as risk and rewards are concerned, the paper explains bitcoin is less volatile than its early days. However, amongst the traditional assets measured within the report the cryptocurrency has the most volatility the paper explains:    As reported in the paper a few months ago Ark Invest and Coinbase believe bitcoin is on its way to being a recognized asset class. The paper details that cryptocurrencies have various network effects and significant distinctions compared to other assets. The report is well researched with data from Coinbase, GDAX, other global bitcoin exchanges with various comparisons to conventional assets like gold.  The paper’s data clearly shows the bitcoin economy is increasingly growing larger heading into 2017. The media’s headlines this year calling bitcoin a new safe haven investment make more sense when compared to the report’s new statistics. What do you think about bitcoin as a new type of asset class? Let us know in the comments below.  Images via Shutterstock, and Ark Invest’s report figures.

2017-01-08T19:00:12-04:00,The Who’s Who of the Bitcoinerati â the New 1%?,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-whos-who-of-the-bitcoinerati-the-new-1/,"âWe are the new, wealthy elite, gentleman,â wrote Atlas, an early adopter of bitcoin on a popular web forum dedicated to the digital currency.Â And perhaps that’s the reason bitcoiners love keeping an eye on the top wallet holders, bitcoin’s ‘rich list,’ – the ‘bitcoinerati’, if you will. As bitcoin prices flirt with all-time highs, we took the opportunity to highlight the biggest wallets in bitcoin. Knowing who controls bitcoin wallets is not easy, but the open source community around the cryptocurrency has gathered information to best determine the nature of the top wallets. Also Read:Â â¬140,000 Tesla Bought for Bitcoin in Finland There are many threads and articles online discussing bitcoinâs ârich list.â Bitcoiners collect information on the biggest bitcoin wallets from public sources, people and institutions who have disclosed their holdings and share it. A Bitcoin top holder (sometimes purposely misspelled ‘hodler’ as an inside joke) might be an early adopter, gambling site owner, exchange operator, investor, government agency, and the list goes on. As bitcoin bulls, some hold bitcoin with long-term price speculation in mind as might a safe haven-seeking goldbug. Due to the nature of bitcoin, the identities of many such holders is speculative. Bitcoin founder himself Satoshi Nakamoto has yet to transfer one of his 980,000 bitcoins. Nobody knows how, if at all, satoshi lives. Media outlets including Newsweek and Wired have purported to uncover the real satoshi, but such claims remain unvalidated. Satoshi, the first to mine bitcoins, did so throughout 2009. Whether or not he mined or bought and sold the digital currency with other wallets is unknown.  The graph above is extracted from data in the blockchain. The machine charted here, represented by the black lines started mining from the genesis block, and with the same performance. It’s assumed this is satoshi. Bitcoin’s founder could hold as many as 1,814,400 BTC. Of these holdings, 1,148,800 BTC remain unspent (63%). Spending these transactions could help towards revealing the wallet holder, and thus Mr. Nakamoto. So, where are Satoshi’s bitcoins? Knowing Mr. Nakamoto’s wallet addresses is tough to know. His coins were mined to automatically and randomly generated addresses. It’s thus also tough to know if Mr. Nakamoto is alive and trading or has liquidated some of his fortune. Â (perhaps through an intermediary, like a lawyer) To this day, individuals send bitcoins to the genesis block (sometimes with public notes of gratitude). This address reaped bitcoin’s first mining reward of 50 bitcoins. Other top holders include (or have included) recognizable names like Silk Road administrator Dread Pirate Roberts, Roger Ver, Mark Karpeles, the Federal Bureau of Investigations, Erik Voorhees, Gavin Andresen, Max Keiser, and others. Their bitcoin holdings range between 20,000 and 350,000. Knowledge of holdings is largely dissected in the English-speaking world, which might affect findings. Hal Finney, a computer scientist known as the first person to receive bitcoin in a transaction (sent by satoshi), is believed to have held a substantial stash of bitcoin, but itâs not known whatâs come of these holdings. (many believe the family liquidated Mr. Finney’s bitcoin position) Mr. Finney, an active runner at one point, passed away in 2014 after a battle with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. He was cryopreserved after his passing. âWhen Satoshi announced the first release of the software, I grabbed it right away,” posted Mr. Finney. “I think I was the first person besides Satoshi to run bitcoin. I mined block 70-something, and I was the recipient of the first bitcoin transaction, when Satoshi sent ten coins to me as a test.â San Francisco man Ross Ulbricht, widely accepted as administrator of the original Silk Road, is also considered a top holder. The Silk Road generated approximately 615,000 bitcoins before agents apprehended Mr. Ulbricht in a San Francisco library. The FBI gained access to a 144,000 bitcoin wallet, arguably making them a top holder of the coin. The agency controls another wallet with approximately 30 bitcoins. Just how much Mt. Gox exchange CEO Mark Karpeles holds is unknown. A thorough audits of Mt. Gox profits and losses, would need to be conducted publicly to know how much he owns. Bitcoiners working on the case posit that Wikileaks, the controversial whistleblowing service which once lost access to the banking system and thus its funds, holds approximately 2,500 bitcoins. With a public balance of 1,000 bitcoins, itâs known Wikileaks provides private addresses for large donations where other funds are believed to be received and held. Wikileaks is conjectured to the be 202nd largest bitcoin holder. Some identities simply can’t be known and can only be tied together via circumstantial evidence. This address, containing approximately 66,233.74 bitcoins, received bitcoins from nine other accounts. Bitinfocharts.com highlights the biggest bitcoin addresses at any given time. These wallets mostly received the bitcoins in transactions and could be the wallets of companies in the bitcoin space. The first wallet on the list received its first coins in late 2015. The fourth largest wallet, according to the website, received the first coins of its nearly 80,000 in 2011, and has received coins through December 2016.  Many powerful people have spoken well of bitcoin. Indeed, many of the most powerful people in the world, including Microsoft founder Bill Gates, former Vice President Al Gore, PayPal founder Peter Thiel, real estate mogul Warren Buffett, Google CEO Eric Schmidt, and Virgin Galactic CEO Richard Branson, who once held a meeting of bitcoiners (who referred to themselves as the ‘Bitcoin Illuminati‘) on his private island. If Atlas is right – and some bitcoin holders become the “new, wealthy elite” – the ‘bitcoinerati’ may one day beÂ the new 1%. What do you think about the ‘Bitcoinerati’?

2017-01-08T15:00:59-04:00,An Introduction to Bitcoin Trading and Technical Charts,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-trading-technical-charts/,"Bitcoin trading is a popular market that has been growing in recent years. There are many who obtain bitcoin to hold for long periods of time. However many people trade their bitcoin regularly with intra-range strategies, day trading, leverage trading and more. Often times trading can sometimes be confusing, and there are many things to consider when participating within the exchange environment. Also read: The Bitpay Visa: a Bitcoin-Debit Card Review The price of bitcoin changes often and some would consider the digital asset to be volatile. The fact is, though, that most currencies worldwide change in value quite a bit as well. And people make money trading fiat currencies, and commodities, based on these ups and downs in price. Bitcoin trading and cryptocurrency exchanges have matured quite a bit since the early days. There are multiple trading techniques and a vast array of exchanges that offer different trading services. Today, we will discuss the various surroundings of the bitcoin trading ecosystem and what to expect from these exchange markets. The candlestick chart is the most common chart used to technically analyze and predict Bitcoin’s price movements. The chart is used in many other markets like forex trading and national fiat currencies. This style of charting is very popular but can often be confusing to understand. Unlike bar charts there are different aspects that look at the short and long-term outlooks differently. Candlesticks reference the price of each trading session’s open, high, low, and closing positions. As the chart progresses analysts can apply different trend lines and technical indicators to try and predict price movement but in the trading world nothing is for certain. One style of bitcoin trading that’s quite popular worldwide is day trading; that is, trades speculated within the same day. This means a trader closes their position by the end of the day or within a specific time frame. Intra-range trading (intraday) is relatively the same and traders use shorter periods of time to profit off scalps and sudden fluctuations in bitcoin’s price value. Day trading strategies are driven by profit, and can lead to a lucrative occupation or the significant loss of wealth. Trading this way takes research and practice to perfect the skills good enough to profit daily. This type of trading involves a trader placing a wager that the price of bitcoin will be lower or higher within an arranged period of time. Just recently a trader got some attention for betting on a $10 million bitcoin short position and got liquidated because the price rose significantly. This means the trader placed a bet that the price would drop, but lost, leaving the trader to buy back the bitcoin at market rate. Long positions are basically the opposite and the trader wagers that the price will be higher over time. In essence, this type of trading is like buying a good and hoping the good’s price will drop or rise with the trader profiting from the difference.  There are various methods of trading bitcoin options, futures, and speculative bets. Quite a few exchanges offer these types of trades but all of them require collateral just in case the customer loses. Furthermore, bitcoin futures trading can be risky and traders should hone their skills when entering into these types of bets. Traders often refer to market conditions as “bear” or “bull” markets and sometimes use the phrases “bearish” or “bullish.” A bear market is when bitcoin’s price value drops into a downward trend with increased selling and short positions. A bull market condition references increased buying, a price rise, and traders placing long bets. During a bullish market trend, the price rises steadily and entry points often decrease. Alongside this, during a bearish market trend, investors wait for extended panic selling and entry points. Bear and bull markets often give a brief description of bitcoin’s price value and whether the price trend is up or down. A lot of people assume that trading is easy money but there are significant risks associated with this type of exchange. First and foremost, many traders leave their bitcoins on exchanges. This means they are leaving their funds in the hands of an exchange with expectations the business is responsible and secure. However traders have often learned the hard way, like in the recent Bitfinex hack and the infamous Mt. Gox disaster. Remember – if you don’t possess your private keys you really don’t own the bitcoin. On the flipside, trading can be lucrative with a lot of practice, and it’s a popular environment in the bitcoin space. Additionally, lots of people trade altcoins in order to gain more bitcoin with their profits. Always remember that trading can be risky and requires much practice and even plotted charts, technical indicators, and predictions can often be wrong.

2017-01-08T12:00:36-04:00,How The New Rally Improved Bitcoinâs Upside Potential,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-the-new-rally-improved-bitcoins-upside-potential/,"Recently, bitcoinâs price grew more than 50 percent in less than a month before taking a dip. What goes up comes down, how does the rally affect theÂ bitcoin ecosystem? Bitcoin.com asked Spencer Bogart, Equity Research analyst at Needham & Company, his opinion onÂ the recent bitcoin rally. Also read: A Look At Bitcoin Bubbles, When Will the Next One Be?Â  Analyst Spencer Bogart, who leads Needham & Companyâs coverage of bitcoin, explained to Bitcoin.com what a large bitcoin rally means by comparing it to equities. âIn the equities world, underlying earnings potential drives price,â he began. âSo when you have a big rally in a given stock it eventually hits a point where you canât justify price relative to earnings potential.â When that happens, investors with long positions will scale back thereby reducing their exposure while those with short positions âwill step in more aggressively to balance the market,â he explained. However, unlike equities, bitcoin does not have underlying earnings so it âdoesnât necessarily have the same constraints,â he said and then clarified that: Bitcoin’s price has already risen over 51 percent from the beginning of the month on Bitstamp before taking a significant 20% dip at press time on January 6. Bogart said that âthe vast majority of this rally is speculationâcomplimented by macro-driven demand.â While he himself is in it for the long-haul and does not want to time himself out of the market, he understands that âItâs really hard to argue with taking some profits after a 50% run.â “Anytime price is up more than 40% in less than a month, Iâd say thereâs an elevated chance of a pullback,â he revealed, but emphasized that ânobody knows when or how big it will be.â He then explained that the perception of the rally âdepends significantly on how we frame this,â adding that: Even though the price has dipped below $900 at press time, in the long run, many are still optimistic. Among those foresaw high prices for bitcoin is Civic co-founder and CEO, Vinny Lingham, who predicted that the price of the digital currency will reach $3,000 late this year. âI believe this is entirely possible, but it must happen while maintaining low volatility and steady growth,â Lingham recently wrote on his blog.

Also read: SolidX Files to Become First Bitcoin ETF on NY Stock Exchange  Blockchain technology company, SolidX Partners Inc, first filed a registration statement (Form S-1) with the SEC on July 11, 2016, proposing to launch its SolidX Bitcoin Trust. According to the company’s letter to the SEC in November last year: SolidX Bitcoin Trust will not be actively managed. There is no minimum investment. “An investor may hold as little as a single share, which represents approximately one tenth of a bitcoin,” the company told the SEC. In addition, the company has secured “significant insurance coverage for the bitcoin that will be held by the Trust.” SolidX Bitcoin Trust is to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) Arca under the symbol XBTC. NYSE Arca is the first all-electronic exchange in the U.S. It currently trades more than 8,000 exchange-listed securities and is ranked number one in the listing and trading of exchange-traded product, according to its website. On July 12, NYSE Arca filed with the SEC to list and trade SolidX Bitcoin Trust’s shares. After the SEC repeatedly extended the period to consider approving or disapproving the listing, the Commission announced early this week: The Commission has received seven comments from the industry. All of them were in favor of approving SolidX Bitcoin Trust except one. Ken I Maher’s short and abrupt message to the SEC urged the Commission to consider the risks of the bitcoin ecosystem. Other letters to the Commission includes one submitted collectively by 30 industry leaders such as 21 Inc’s Balaji Srinivasan, Bitpay’s Stephen Pair, Bitstamp’s Nejc Kodrič, Blockchain’s Marco Santori, Circle’s Joshua Lim, and Coin Center’s Jerry Brito. They urged the SEC to approve SolidX Bitcoin Trust’s listing stating that: Denise Krisko, President of Vident Investment Advisory LLC, told the SEC “The trust will benefit investors and the broader Bitcoin ecosystem through access to a liquid and transparent product that will further drive this innovative and exciting technology.” Joseph Colangelo, President of Consumers’ Research, told the Commission that “Bitcoin has established itself as a significant new asset class,” stating “the SolidX Bitcoin Trust will protect U.S. consumers in a way that truly bears in mind the best interest of such consumers.” Meanwhile, Cato Institute’s Associate Director, Thaya Brook Knight noted that “approving the rule change would ultimately promote investor protection, and would therefore forward the mission of the SEC.” Do you think the SEC will approve SolidX’s listing on the NYSE Arca in March?

Bitcoin.com interviewed SurBTC’s CEO Guillermo Torrealba about the bitcoin market in Colombia. Also read:Â Colombiaâs First Bitcoin Exchange Closed by RegulatorsÂ  SurBTC operates bitcoin exchanges in Chile and Colombia. The company launched the Colombian exchange at the end of August last year. âToday Chile is several times larger than Colombia,â Torrealba told Bitcoin.com. Colombiaâs âarchaic banking infrastructureâ presents opportunities for many bitcoin services to deliver innovative solutions âwithout the need of going through the traditional financial industry,â heÂ described, noting that: Findings by the International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, support his point. Colombiaâs economic potential and competitiveness are âconstrained by the poor quality of its national infrastructure,â the IFC wrote in its April report. It also estimates that the country suffers an annual infrastructure financing gap of as much as $1.5 trillion but traditional sources of infrastructure financing such as banks, governments, international financial institutions cannot meet this financing needs. âSince the global financial crisis of 2008, structural weaknesses in the banking sector have led to deleveraging and restrained credit growth. And new banking regulations have adversely affected the ability of banks to provide long-term financing,â the Corporation wrote. âOperating in Colombia has way more challenges than what we expected in the beginning,â Torrealba revealed, citing its âbank-relation-intensiveâ operation. The Colombian bitcoin ecosystem is âgrowing very fast but very contaminated with Bitcoin-based ponzi schemes,â he explained. That is the reason the Financial Superintendency post official press releases warning about the risks of bitcoin and has prohibited banks from “touching” it, he added. However, the warning was ambiguous âwhich has caused great confusion among people and companies.â Nonetheless, Torrealba said: Regarding recent news articles claiming that the Head of the Financial Superintendency, Francisco Reyes Villamizar,Â has declared bitcoin illegal, Torrealba said âThis is not accurate,â citing that his warning did not mean that bitcoin is illegal. âIn fact, it isn’t and is the reason why we’re still operating,â he concluded.

2017-01-07T07:00:17-04:00,Price Reports and Tales From China-Dizzy Bitcoiners,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/price-reports-tales-china-dizzy-bitcoiners/,"Once again the bitcoin community has been dizzy due to the significant price increase, the following correction, and rumors of China. After the sharp price rally, the discussion has turned to the Chinese central bank warning about the volatile cryptocurrency bitcoin. Also read: China to Play a ‘Leading Role’ in Bitcoin’s Future Here’s what we know. The price of everyone’s favorite digital asset had dramatically risen in value at the beginning of the year reaching roughly $1,145 USD per bitcoin. The day after this substantial gain, bitcoin took a significant dive shaving over $300 off the price. The sudden drop was unexpected to some as the cryptocurrency’s crossover to the 4-digit range didn’t last long. Speculators wondered where the bearish decline was stemming from blaming miners selling off at the end of the year, to those who held for over three years to gain back what they once lost. However, the uncertainty once again turned to China as many started to speculate the price drop derived from that region. The bitcoin community and mainstream media heard reports of China’s central bank warning about bitcoin. According to the regional publication 8BTC.com, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC) explained Chinese exchanges should conduct a self examination of their operations. “The recent Bitcoin Price is highly volatile,” explains the PBOC. “To prevent risks and uphold financial stability, PBOC Shanghai and Financial Office of Beijing have jointly met the major heads of OKcoin and Huobi to know the current status of Bitcoin trading. We have reminded them of possible risks and require it operate strictly in accordance with laws and regulations of China. We have urged the two exchanges to conduct self-examination based on related laws and correct, if any, possible irregularities.” After roughly six hours of media reporting that China was banning bitcoin again, statements came out from the Chinese exchange BTCC. The exchange explains that bitcoin is not at all banned in the country and the warning was business as usual. BTCC founder Bobby Lee details:  Furthermore, Lee explains that the bank was warning about the volatility of the cryptocurrency just as it had in 2013. Back in 2013, there were swathes of headlines stating the PBOC was going to ban bitcoin when in fact the bank was merely warning the country’s investors. Lee says that “bitcoin is a virtual good and doesn’t have legal tender status,” and all users should be aware of the risks of volatile trading.  As soon as the bitcoin community started hearing these stories, some believed it but most shrugged it off. Many of them laughing over the internet and posting their favorite China bans bitcoin memes. Others have been speculating that these rumors stem from people wanting to shake up the markets for cheap bitcoins.  Bitcoin is not banned in China and bitcoin is significantly cheaper than it was a few days ago. This is what we know, and everything else has been a mixture of price dizziness, fear, uncertainty, and doubt.

2017-01-06T19:00:25-04:00,Top Trends Pushing Bitcoin Towards The Mainstream,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/top-trends-pushing-bitcoin-mainstream/,"Like a pack of predators in the night, bitcoin is creeping up into mainstream use from multiple different angles. From the poorest in developing countries to the top banks alike, the digital currency is being used in every stratum of humanity. Bitcoin.com explores some of the biggest use cases that could propel bitcoin to mainstream usage. Also read: 2016: The Year Bitcoin Adoption Goes Mainstream?   Chinese volumes make up over 90 percent of all bitcoin trading. Whenever the yuan is devalued, and the government announces capital controls, bitcoin’s price usually gets a boost. The digital currency is gaining popularity as a way for the Chinese to get money out of their country. Estimates place offshore tax havens holdings as large as $32 Trillion dollars. Hiding wealth from governments is one of bitcoin’s biggest use cases to date. This should grow as more people learn to trust bitcoin as a store of wealth, especially when Swiss bank accounts have recently lost their anonymity and the Panama Papers leak revealed that offshore banking is not safe either. Hyperinflation, demonetization, haircuts, bailouts, and other drastic monetary policies are happening at a faster pace globally. Each time it happens, hundreds or even thousands of the smartest people in that country wake up to bitcoin as they watch the value of their personal savings dwindle. While each event has so far only added a modest few to the ranks of the bitcoin faithful, bitcoin is becoming better recognized as a hedge against local currency problems after each event. A large number of startups now offer remittance solutions using bitcoin, undercutting the speed and costs of traditional remittances by a wide margin. In some places, the solution has worked so well that it’s taken over 20 percent of a local remittance corridor. In Korea, one mainstream bank is already using one of these bitcoin-backed services for cross-border remittances. Bittorrent is free, you say? Sure, but good VPNs are not. Internet Service Providers (ISP) have to work with their local governments and the MPAA to catch pirates downloading videos, which accounts for roughly three-fourths of streaming activity on the entire web. To get around this roadblock, users buy VPN service to hide from their local ISP and continue to watch free movies and tv shows with little worry. In order to hide the purchase of VPN services, downloaders have turned to Bitcoin. Most VPN services now accept the digital currency as a form of payment, and even encourage it for the sake of privacy. Unfortunately bitcoin’s excellent features have made it very attractive to the ransomware industry. It’s estimated that over 93 percent of all phishing emails contains links to download ransomware now, with social media also becoming a major attack vector. Now a Billion dollar industry, the use case of ransomware is hurting bitcoin’s reputation while simultaneously forcing businesses and others with important data to stock up on bitcoins in preparation for a hack. A recent report from Citrix and Censuswide showed that 33 percent of large businesses in the UK already have their bitcoins stocked and ready to go. It’s no secret that the adult industry is popular on the internet. Both the adult industry and online gambling have laws prohibiting their use in various countries around the world, giving businesses in these niches a very difficult time getting and keeping payment providers. Bitcoin has already started to flourish among a large number of popular sites in both industries. Micropayments, machine payments, multisignature payments, machine escrow, provably-fair betting, and many other types of functionality that bitcoin allows for the first time is giving the cryptocurrency many new uses among entrepreneurs and startups. Countless ideas like Internet of Things incentivization, small-scale affiliate payouts, streaming video payments, internet tipping, and monetized Bittorrent downloads were not possible before bitcoin came along. Now, startups are popping up daily with new business models based upon them. Given time, it’s not just a matter of one of them going mainstream; it’s a matter of mainstream users getting a taste for new abilities that can’t be had without Bitcoin. The oldest use case for bitcoin has not disappeared. In June 2011, bitcoin found its first successful industry, selling questionably-legal goods on dark websites like the Silk Road. The drug-filled e-commerce site flourished and caused a dramatic price spike that propelled bitcoin into the news as the new way to get illegal drugs online. After the Silk Road was shut down, many others have emerged to take its place. This ensures that bitcoin, especially once additional privacy-enhancing features like CoinJoin and TumbleBit are added, will remain the best way to anonymously buy anything online. Bitcoin is a possible solution to many of the world’s problems. Satoshi Nakamoto himself was trying to solve a major problem with the existing financial system when he created it. Several ideological reasons exist incentivizing people to hold bitcoin, such as wanting to fix problems with the existing monetary system, or not wanting to fund immoral wars with their taxes. Many more people wanting the benefit of a global trust machine in their everyday life will also become bitcoin holders sooner or later. The amount that each person holds may not be very much, but the sheer number of people who want to change the world for the better is boundless. Which of these trends do you think is most helping bitcoin reach the mainstream? Let us know in the comments section below.

2017-01-06T12:00:45-04:00,Bitcoin is Tapping Into the Laws of Nature – Part 2,Mike White,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-tapping-laws-nature-part-2/,"In Part One of this series we looked at the “survival of the fittest” and the fact that it leads to competition in a never-ending process of getting better. This article, Part 2, discusses how things get better, the process of innovation in nature. In nature, changes occur as little experiments on the edge of what is considered “normal”. These side projects branch off and either survive to keep going or fall away. Whether it be the first animals with opposable thumbs or Bill Gates tinkering with computers in a garage, both were innovating at the edge. Another important aspect of this process of innovation is the fact that neither the monkey or Bill Gates asked for, or required, permission from some “authority”. The current financial system and governments work differently on both accounts. To make any changes, most of the time you have to 1. innovate from the middle and 2. have permission to do it. Legacy financial system proponents cry that we need to do things this way and have “safeguards” in place to protect people from bad actors. But all these safeguards ever accomplish is to slow down innovation. How? Well, companies at the top effectively pull the ladder up from behind them by lobbying that consumers need more protection. So the government creates licences and regulations which makes it difficult and expensive for new competitors to break into the industry. Then the players at the top create an oligopoly and are not forced to actually compete anymore. This always leaves the consumer in a worse position in the long term. Innovation is dead. Innovation without permission is one of the best ways to forecast how fast a product or service will get better. Your phone has more computing power and is orders of magnitude cheaper than the computers we used to go to the moon. On the other end, let’s look at money and government, 2 of the most regulated areas of our modern society. The biggest innovations in finance over the last 40 years are ATM’s and a chip in your card that allows you to hover instead of swipe. Insert condescending slow clap here. And, as for any innovation in government (apart from the Pirate Party) in the last 40 yrs, please let me know. I challenge you to find any industry which has improved as little as finance or governance in recent history. Innovation is messy. Things get broken. Mistakes are made. People get hurt and lose money. However as in nature, people and markets learn from their mistakes, they get wiser, smarter and more resilient. The financial system has not learned from its mistakes. Irresponsible bank lending and derivatives are beyond the levels of 2008. Argentina is making the same mistakes they have made for generations. The faster innovation can take place, the faster we can make the inevitable mistakes and reach the promised land of better results. The longer the innovation takes, the more people have to suffer their current circumstances. See also: Bitcoin is Tapping into the Laws of Nature Part 1 Bitcoin has 1000’s of developers around the world innovating on the edges. The Yours Network launching early 2017 and countless other projects do not need any permission from bitcoin core or anyone else to be used. If people find their services useful, they will be used, otherwise they will be forgotten. Current fiat systems are restrictive, corrupt, outdated, monopolistic dinosaurs. But now that bitcoin is here, people from all corners of the globe have the power to opt out and be a part of and contribute to a voluntary system that can innovate without permission. As Jeff Goldblum’s character in Jurassic Park famously stated, “Life finds a way”. I would say the table we started in Part 1 is clearly showing a trend. Stay tuned for Part 3 of our discussion where we cover the most fundamental of nature’s laws – Mathematics.

2017-01-06T09:00:47-04:00,Bitcoin Growing Fast In Unbanked Indonesia,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-growing-fast-in-unbanked-indonesia/,"Indonesia, trailing just behind the United States as the fourth most populous country in the world, has a large and growing bitcoin community. The vast population is 80 percent unbanked, and their Rupiah is one of the most-traded currencies for bitcoin worldwide already. Bitcoin.com interviewed Suasti Atmastuti Astaman, the Business Development Manager of Indonesian bitcoin exchange Bitcoin.co.id. Also read: Here Are Bitcoin’s 8 Fastest Growing Markets  Bitcoin.com (BC): What’s your market share of the Indonesian bitcoin market? Bitcoin.co.id (BI): We have more than 229,500 members with daily growth around 100-150 members. Our daily transaction volume can reach up to 1.5 million USD per day. And we are listed as one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges in Southeast Asia. I believe we control for more than 70% Bitcoin transaction in Indonesia, considering we are the biggest Bitcoin exchange in Indonesia. BC: Can you describe the bitcoin market in Indonesia? BI: The majority of members in our Bitcoin exchange serve as Bitcoin traders, rather than Bitcoin users. They buy Bitcoin in intention to gain profit and use it whether for a short-term investment, a long-term one or perhaps both. They trade quite often, buying Bitcoin when the price is low, and selling it again when the price increases. There are a lot of people in Indonesia that love to take profit from trading, not just cryptocurrency, but also stocks and foreign exchange. Apparently, they love Bitcoin just as much since the price tends to fluctuate a lot. For people who love the idea of Bitcoin as a new form of money, they are going to hate knowing that there a lot of people taking profit from Bitcoin trading but that’s the fact and it contributes quite a lot to our trading volume. But of course, there are also people who buy Bitcoin in order to shop (mostly online) or to make transactions in various MLM or money game websites. BC: What main uses of bitcoin are you seeing in Indonesia? BI: As I have mentioned before, it appears that there are more traders than actual Bitcoin users. It is not allowed for Indonesian people to pay for something within the country using any other currency other than Rupiah—not US Dollar, not Yen, and definitely not Bitcoin. But even so, Bitcoin merchants keep appearing in Indonesia and there are also a lot of our members that use Bitcoin to pay for Internet and electricity bills, top up their cellphones balance, book a plane ticket, etc. Personally, as we are serving in a country where there are at least 80% of unbanked people in the market due to our vast region and there are more than 250 million people in term of population with remittance market cap reaching around 7 billion US dollar a year, it is only right if we try to use Bitcoin to support remittance services and make it easier, faster and cheaper for people to transfer money from anywhere around the world to Indonesia or vice versa. Digital cash such as Bitcoin will allow people to hold their own money without involving any third parties—this surely will make them interested in giving it a chance. I believe there will be a lot of people in Southeast Asia, where there are thousands of people working overseas and transferring money back home, who will find Bitcoin exciting and a great way to transfer money. BC: What does the Indonesian government say about bitcoin? BI: Other than giving an official statement about how they see Bitcoin, which you can see here, the Indonesian government hasn’t made any important moves to restrict or facilitate bitcoin transactions in Indonesia. Since Bitcoin is not treated as a currency, we cannot pay for something with Bitcoin in Indonesia (the government only allows Rupiah as a legal payment instrument in the country). This is why almost every merchant in Indonesia that accepts payments in Bitcoin, automatically converts the Bitcoins they receive into Rupiah and send the money into their bank account. This way, Bitcoin pretty much works like credit card and thus, does not violate the rules from government. With no clear regulation, we’re operating as a marketplace that obeys the usual regulation regarding financial transactions in Indonesia which is collecting their ID, asking their sources of funds and the purpose of their transactions. We do this to comply with the KYC in order to prevent money laundering happening within the country using Bitcoin. BC: How fast are you expecting bitcoin adoption to grow going forward? BI: With clear regulation, minimum amount of bad press, and huge effort in marketing? Soon, I guess. Even without those three, people are starting to love bitcoin more and more and treat it as a great way to invest. They start reading news about what’s happening around the cryptocurrency world in other countries, and there are a lot of positive news nowadays to keep Bitcoin interesting and people engaged.

2017-01-06T06:00:31-04:00,Director Cannucciari on Making “Banking on Bitcoin”,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/director-cannucciari-on-making-banking-on-bitcoin/,"A feature film on Bitcoin, called “Banking on Bitcoin”, is set to be released on January 6, 2017. Produced by Gravitas Ventures, the film will cover many of the space’s best-known players, such as Charlie Shrem, Barry Silbert, Erik Voorhees, Nathaniel Popper and more.  Also Read: ‘Life on Bitcoin’ is Easier Than Producing a Film About It Bitcoin.com spoke with director Christopher Cannucciari, the film’s director, about why he set out to make a bitcoin film.  Why did you choose to make a bitcoin film? CC: It’s interesting. It’s an open-source project, so everyone brings to it what they can. I can’t program. I hoped to bring what I could with filmmaking to the world of bitcoin, and to a wider audience, who have maybe heard about Bitcoin, Mt. Gox, Charlie Shrem and the Silk Road. The film doesn’t pretend these things didn’t happen, but hopes to provide some context. Maybe they were judged harshly or maybe these things are necessary for something to grow like bitcoin has. You have to take the good with the bad and see what you are left with. At the end of the day, bitcoin is this open-source project so powerful it is changing people’s lives. BN: What was your experience with bitcoin when you started filming more than three years ago? CC: I came as a complete outsider to bitcoin in 2013, though I was always interested the technology. I come to it with a filmmaker’s perspective. I had had one experience with digital currency. I worked on a short documentary in Africa in 2008, where there was political turmoil and the banks were closed. Pre-Safaricom in east Africa, instead of people trading money from one end of country to the other, they traded phone credits.  Using phone credits was an organic homegrown idea that arose out of the necessity. That was a novel idea and I thought, ‘Wouldn’t that be cool if we could be so forward thinking here in the US or developed world. When bitcoin was on the rise in 2012-2013, I was watching it keenly to see if this could be that next step in the evolution of money, and I think it is. I was really attracted to the idea of emailable money. What jumped out at you while making the film? CC: The community behind getting bitcoin into the mainstream has been amazing. There were all these cypherpunks in the nineties. They had this idea of cryptocurrency, and maybe others before that. It really took an upswell of the bitcoin community to get the novel idea of bitcoin on the map. That was awesome to see.  What was the hardest part of making a film about bitcoin?  CC: The hardest thing is, ‘When do you stop filming a story about bitcoin?’ There is no end point to bitcoin. For me, the film became about the early bitcoin utopians and programmers thinking bitcoin could take power away from the banks. The idea of this open ledger attracted people early on. So, for me the question was, ‘What is the response from national government, and what is the response from banks, going to be if this is something in opposition to what they do? How are they going to respond? Is bitcoin ever going to get big enough for them to respond.’  Sure enough that was happening. The regulation of bitcoin businesses in New York state with the BitLicense was a moment where I thought, ‘This could be the heart of the story.’ I wondered, ‘Was it good to regulate bitcoin early on or do you let it grow?’ That was something we were constantly aware of, at least in New York state.  Bitcoin is also interesting because it’s not physical, and film is a visual medium. That was certainly a challenge. We didn’t want to just put up graphics of casascius coins endlessly, especially with the talented Molly Schwartz doing lead animation on the film.

2017-01-05T19:00:05-04:00,Is Bitcoin the Currency of Artificial Intelligence?,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-currency-artificial-intelligence/,"Futurists imagine a day where robots might own ‘themselves’, and even trade property with other robots. Some believe bitcoin could even become the ‘currency of AI.’ Also Read: Google’s DeepMind Healthcare AI Will Use Blockchain  What if robots are self-sovereign entities and they can own property, own money, have legal rights and so forth? “There’s actually a lot of precedence for that,” says Jeff Garzik, bitcoin developer and CEO of Bloq, enterprise blockchain developer with emphasis on networks like bitcoin. “It’s been assumed as inevitable that robots will exist and they will own property.”  Mr. Garzik believes robots could one day be considered legal persons, and even trade bitcoins. The bitcoin developer cites how corporations enjoy legal personhood. “It’s a legal fiction that they are an entity separate from an individual person,” he told Bitcoin.com. “Entity-hood means corporations can own property, and that they are liable. They are sued instead of individuals running the company.”  Like a corporation, robots will soon be able to hold value. “We see with bitcoin and cryptocurrencies situations where the technology allows one person to control one-fifth of an asset,” the Bloq founder explained, referring to a multi-signature transaction protocol where three out of five private key holders must sign off for a transaction to be executed. “What if the asset-holders were robot shareholders in a corporation or property? [That’s] pure code, pure robotic script. And Bitcoin helps with that. Cryptocurrency startups are building autonomous agents right now.” “Robot scripts can hire people, they can invest in things with cryptocurrency, and hedge funds even use robot-advisors with some sense of individuality already,” elucidates Mr. Garzik, who believes self and identity are the minimum for having an ‘electronic person,’ the policy term for a robot with legal recognition. ‘Robots’ do trade amongst themselves already on Wall Street. The U.S. brokerage and banking company Charles Schwab has intelligent robot advisors, which the firm markets. On Wall Street, financial analysts are being replaced by robots that read – and react – to Twitter feeds.  Bots also read Reuters, AP, CNBC Financial Times, Bloomberg to forecast how world events might impact the market it trades – from particular assets, equities, commodities, etc. “Both stock trades and real world events like Brexit happen so fast,” the former bitcoin core developer reasons, “that humans cannot react to this huge volume of information quickly and in an unemotional, logical manner. Crypto currencies and machine learning are thus converging rapidly.”  Mr. Garzik, who specifically believes bitcoin could be the currency of narrow or artificial intelligence, suggests the European Union might recognize the inevitability of robot personhood. A draft motion of the European Parliament last summer suggested robot workers be classified as ‘electronic persons.’ Their owners would have to pay social security for them based on the amount of labor costs the employer saved by using a robot rather than a human, according to the draft European Parliament motion dated May 31, 2016.  Robots could claim copyright on intellectual property and trade money, if the EU adopted the draft. Alongside private property and other legal rights for robots, society will need to determine how one can sue a robot who is liable for damage. “Bitcoin is such a natural thing to pair with AI,” says Richard Craib, founder of Numerai, a data-based San Francisco hedge fund. “Maybe not super important to consumers, but when you want to have software interacting anonymously and people submitting predictions to hedge funds, it makes a lot sense.” In a future where a property can own itself, Mr. Garzik wonders, “What happens when your toaster notices your refrigerator has a fault and shorts the stock of the refrigerator manufacture in bitcoin?” Would you welcome ‘Robot-Bitcoiners’ in our midst? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock  Bitcoin.com believes in freedom of speech – and that’s what you’ll always find on our Forums.

2017-01-05T12:00:32-04:00,Death & Bitcoin: How I Prepared My Family’s Digital Inheritance,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/death-bitcoin-digital-inheritance/,"As a writer who earns bitcoin and saves as much as I can with a family of four, I’ve recently begun preparing my family’s digital inheritance. When I pass, my wife will take over all of my assets, and this includes bitcoin. Preparing another person to gain access to their bitcoin private keys before death is necessary. Also Read: Can Bureaucrats Really Regulate Bitcoin? Getting old is something we can’t stop, but we can prepare our loved ones for when we leave the earth. Recently, I have been making somewhat of a digital will for my wife for when I die so she will be able to access all my online accounts and bitcoin access. If I were to unexpectedly die it would be tough for my wife to manage our bitcoin assets without help and guidance. This issue is something bitcoiners should consider. Some people are not married and may even have to disclose this information to a family member or close friend. Since before bitcoin, digital inheritance has been a problem to solve for people worldwide. If a friend or family member cannot gain access to your passwords and some personal information, then things like online bank accounts, email, and social media can be lost forever. Additionally, this also applies to cryptocurrency with passwords, PINs, and 12-24 word mnemonic phrases (seed). If you don’t leave this information behind somehow, then stored bitcoins could be lost forever. This past month I have been preparing my digital inheritance that will be given to my wife when I complete it. It’s nothing technologically innovative but merely a small notebook of handwritten information on how to access my online accounts and cryptocurrency. Access to our bitcoin is important because it could help with future living expenses, a funeral, and many costs associated with death. The small notebook’s location is well hidden and stored in a fireproof safe, and only my wife knows the location. Now there are platforms that can store online account information and passwords. A company such as Lifebank can store this data offline. My approach, however, is more old school and more secure in my opinion, even though there are always vulnerabilities. The notebook’s location could be found, and the information could be compromised by a malicious person. Yet, I believe this could very well happen to a third party storing my data as well and I feel more comfortable being my own bank. The first steps I did for giving my wife instructions on accessing my bitcoin is explaining where it is all held. I use multiple types of wallets with my phone, and a few hardware wallet models as well. After explaining how to access each bitcoin account, I have written information on each credential needed to access these locations. For instance, I provided my wife with all the passwords and PINs tethered to my wallets. Furthermore, the backup seed phrase is also written down just in case the other passwords don’t work, or my phone wallet or hardware device was lost or stolen. After finishing an entirely handwritten walkthrough of how to access my cryptocurrency, my wife will now have the ability to use our funds. She’s always had a say in how we spend and save our money, including bitcoin, but she’s never really been interested in commanding these wallets on her own. However, we have agreed to do a digital walk-through of these steps so she can get a better grasp of how to access my digital possessions. There’s a lot to think about when it comes to digital inheritance, and the thought can be morbid. Nonetheless, it’s a good idea to be prepared because death can happen at any time. Bitcoin can be left to a trusted person so the digital asset can be used by someone else when you pass. A good idea is to do a rundown of who you think that most trusted person may be. It could be a wife, husband, mother, sister or even best friend. At least you can rest easy knowing that, if anything unfortunate happens to you, your cryptocurrencies and online accounts will be in good hands.

2017-01-05T06:00:52-04:00,The Bitpay Visa: a Bitcoin-Debit Card Review,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitpay-visa-bitcoin-debit-card-review/,"Bitcoin debit cards have become more popular over the past two years with various choices on the table for consumers to choose from. Cards enable a user to load the account with bitcoin reserves and spend the funds where major credit cards are accepted. Bitcoin.com decided to review the popular bitcoin debit card currently available to U.S. cryptocurrency supporters. We hope to explain in detail how this loadable card works so our readers can get an idea of what it’s like to utilize these types of cards. Also read: Ledger Nano S Review: Can This $65 Device Top Trezor? Just recently I ordered the Bitpay bitcoin Visa card, available to U.S. residents in all fifty states. The card cost me $9.99, and you have to pay for the product in bitcoin. There wasn’t much to fill out for verification purposes. Registration required my social security number, email, and current mailing address. Other than those requests nothing more was required from me for identity. After registration, I paid for the card with a Bitpay invoice and was told I would receive the card in 7-10 business days. Five days later I had received my card, including a PIN and references to card fees. The PIN is used like a traditional debit purchase and also for ATM access. After getting my card and reviewing the fees, I went to the Bitpay Visa card activation page. The page asks for the credit card number, three-digit CVV, and your email. As soon as the information is processed, you now have access to an account page. The account page is where you load bitcoins onto the card. There is a button that says “add funds, of” and you type in how much money you want to load in USD. I decided how much I wanted to add to the card and entered the amount, which then processes a new Bitpay invoice. Like any Bitpay invoice you have 15 minutes to pay and I scanned the address with my phone’s wallet, thereby paying the amount. Immediately the invoice is marked as received, but funds are not accessible until the transaction receives one confirmation. It must have been a busy day because I had to wait for my transaction to confirm. When it did, my card was loaded with funds. One should note that bitcoin transactions sent to the Bitpay card are basically sales and you receive the funds in USD at the current BTC spot price. As soon as the funds are loaded, the USD amount never changes. This is different than using Coinbase’s Shift card which deducts bitcoin spends based on the spot price as merchant transactions are processed. Users can load $10,000 per day and up to $25,000 can be held on the Bitpay Visa. Such amounts are probably not secure enough tied to such cards. With money on my Bitpay card, I traveled to the nearest convenience store to make a purchase. Overall using the Bitpay debit card was pleasant and simple. It definitely uses immediate fiat conversion which is a downside, but basically allows for easy bitcoin sales with a personal debit card in real-time. Purchases were simple and after every one I had visible access to these transactions on my account page. Fees are explained throughout the whole process and are relatively inexpensive and can be avoided. ATM fees are $2, ACH transfers are $5, and there’s a charge of $5 if you don’t use the card for 90 days. I will definitely be using my new Bitpay card from time to time as it does add a nice level of convenience. What do you think about the Bitpay card? What kind of bitcoin-debit card have you used? Let us know about your experiences in the comments below.

2017-01-04T19:00:47-04:00,Can Bitcoin Businesses Break ‘Affiliate Site’ Stereotypes?,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/can-bitcoin-businesses-break-affiliate-site-stereotypes/,"Last week, Bitcoin.com reported on Supload, a new image-hosting service that pays users in bitcoin for views on their uploaded images. While the service has been well received by bitcoiners, some users have raised concerns that the public at large is not sharing their enthusiasm, stereotyping it as “just another affiliate referral website.” Bitcoin.com investigates how bitcoin businesses can overcome this public perception. Also read: New Image Hosting Service Pays Thousands of Uploaders in Bitcoin  User ‘Vigilante_Gamer’ wrote on Reddit that “Most of the time when I’ve shared images from Supload, it was received just fine.” However, one instance his post drew negative reaction causing him to delete the post and stop using the service “unless the public perception changes.” He explained that “People in the thread considered it a ‘shady’ website simply because they checked out the site and saw that it said ‘earn bitcoin!’” The negative reaction he received was not bitcoin-specific, but rather a perception that Supload is “just another affiliate referral website,” which is why it appeared shady. A user told him that “People typically spam their referral links all over the place hoping to get them popular so they can make money.” Others on this thread agreed that affiliate sites appear to say “click this so I can make money” rather than “I want to share something with you.” Arguably, Supload is not an affiliate website since it hosts images and shares advertising revenues with its users. Vigilante_Gamer compared its revenue-sharing model to Youtube, which hosts videos and pays users a portion of their revenue as well. However, the analogy failed to resonate with some users. The response he received was: While Youtube is not without its own spamming or worse problems, it’s perceived by the public as a “good video host – not because it makes money” said one of his detractors, adding that “Aside from big YouTubers, not many people are making money off it.” With over a billion users worldwide, Youtube is often subject to crooks wanting to exploit its platform for monetary gains. The difference is that while Supload users want to earn bits from their uploads, most Youtube spammers aim higher than the small amount of revenue-share provided by Google. Thus, they market more aggressively. Some of Youtube’s problems date back many years. In 2009, Kaspersky Lab detected a spam campaign with a link to YouTube that featured an unsolicited video advertisement. In 2014, Trend Micro discovered malicious ads on the site that can lead to malware exploit kits. In 2015, Symantec found a trend in an SMS spam campaign directing users to a YouTube video with a link to an adult website. Changing public opinion takes a long time and requires educational outreach. Wendy Salomon, vice president of reputation management at Nielsen, explained that in many cases the reputation of a given brand is directly tied to its industry. It may take some time before the public stops linking startups like Supload with affiliate sites in their minds. However, Salomon believes that individual companies can overcome poor industry reputation “by focusing on their individual reputation and telling their company’s unique story.” For Supload users and bitcoin promoters alike, focusing on high quality is the best tactic. Continued, steady promotions of high-quality materials have dual benefits. Not only do you make more money from the larger number of prospects, but you also help normalize that brand or product for others in the future. Mike Reilly, Supload co-founder and website programmer, told Bitcoin.com: Do you think bitcoin companies can soon break the ‘affiliate site’ stereotypes? Let us know in the comments section below.

At press time the current price per BTC is $1,130, and the past 24 hours of trading has been volatile. Since the 4-digit price break the digital asset has dipped slightly below $1,000 twice so far, but technical indicators suggest bitcoin’s ascending channel shows a continued upward push. Also read: The Bitcoin Constellation Is Bigger Than Most Realize The fiat value of bitcoin climbed to a position it hasn’t seen in three years on the first day of the new year. The price has steadily hovered in the $1010-1030 range over the course of the past 24-hours. Then on January 4 the price shot forward to above $1100 per BTC. Candlestick charts show the bullish uptrend may continue after pushing through certain resistance levels. Currently, bitcoin’s volume of over $294 million is very high, and the digital assets’ crypto-currency dominance level, which measures a digital currency’s performance in relation to other coins, is approaching 90 percent. However, the psychological aspect of reaching the 4-digit range is making the ride along the way quite bumpy.  One week charts show a bullish formation, as well, with the price edging towards the $1120-1150 marks. If the price corrects, there’s a strong floor in the $1000 range and its doesn’t look as though bears could pull it down lower than that. As usual, during these shaky times, it’s a great opportunity for day traders and intra-range strategies. Buying levels could fade a touch as Stochastic variables suggest the value may be overbought. Nonetheless the 100 and 200 Simple Moving Average (SMA) suggest the uptrend may see $1200 in the near future.  Mainstream media was awfully quiet when the price broke 4-digits, but that may have been due to light work schedules over the New Year holiday. There have been headlines from the BBC, the Guardian, and a couple of others but not as many stories as there were in 2013. Nonetheless, the Netherlands mainstream newspaper de Volkskrant covered the subject in great detail. U.S. media has been covering bitcoin’s price performance but definitely way less than before. Of course, cryptocurrency and blockchain-centric news outlets have been all over the story. Even though it’s not as chaotic during this particular bitcoin bull run, media over the past two weeks has been pleasantly positive, to say the least. Some of the biggest stories of the year that affected bitcoin’s high demand were headlines about economic turbulence throughout the globe. Brexit set off one of the first big prices pushes of the year alongside capital controls, hyperinflation, and devalued currencies. Tales from India, China, and Latin American were abundant this year, and many speculate a vast portion of these citizens have turned to bitcoin. Another factor that has set in was this summer’s reward halving and the mining of the 16 millionth bitcoin. The fact that the digital currency is becoming more scarce has increased its worth in the long run.  Bitcoin’s current resistance is in the $1140-1150 range at press time with a global spot price average of $1125. Of course, the $1200 mark and higher is attainable, but there will be some stops along the way if upward momentum keeps up. Another psychological moment will be when the price outperforms the value of one troy ounce of .999 gold. Bitcoin’s high price can be scary to some as many are expecting a bubble burst or deeper correction. A bearish trend could happen if something triggers a shake up, like an unfortunate event for example.  Bear Scenario: Bitcoin is holding steady above $1100 USD per BTC at the moment. As abovementioned, this number is extremely psychological, and there could be a downturn. Floors suggest a correction no lower than $1000, looking at current depth and order books. A few bear traps should be expected in the near future. Bull Scenario: Technical indicators show that the pressure upwards will continue for the time being. Strategically the price looks to be headed north at ranges in between $1150-1200. Fibonacci trend lines suggest the bull run is headed towards parity with the gold ounce shortly. Economic events from China like yuan devaluation, confidence in the U.S. federal reserve, and failing Latin American economies will likely keep the ascending momentum going.

2017-01-03T19:00:09-04:00,Can Bureaucrats Really Regulate Bitcoin?,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/can-bureaucrats-really-regulate-bitcoin/,"Discussion about bitcoin regulation often resembles mixing oil and water. This becomes more apparent as governments and bureaucrats worldwide ponder how they can apply regulatory policy to bitcoin. As the cryptocurrency gains significant popularity, the question arises: ‘Can bitcoin be regulated?’ Also Read: American Black Cross Helps Political Prisoners With Bitcoin  2016 was a remarkable year for bitcoin as it increased in value exponentially to become a store of value and financial safe haven. The year also saw lawmakers worldwide investigating possible ways to regulate bitcoin. The problem is government officials do not understand cryptocurrency, and it poses many challenges to the way things traditionally work. Bitcoin has allowed people to exchange value without the need for government or central banks. The decentralized payment system operates beyond borders with no regulatory permission. Within the bitcoin community, there are those who believe bitcoin needs to be regulated. Additionally, there are many who believe regulatory policies cannot be applied to the digital currency. Over time the agencies and courts of nation-states have classified the cryptocurrency with rules and definitions that are poles apart. This past weekend, bitcoin luminary Andreas Antonopoulos detailed his opinion of whether or not the decentralized currency can even be regulated.  The bottom line is across the world there is no clear consensus on how to regulate the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. The fact of the matter is it will be a continuous uphill battle for bureaucrats. It’s been eight years with people doing what they want with their wealth, and bitcoin technology has enabled this. However, that doesn’t mean governments will stop trying to enforce regulations. In fact, the nation-states will try harder as each, and every one of them will feel bitcoin’s economic disruption. For instance, this past year in the U.S. there has been a lot of regulatory discussion about virtual currencies. A handful of states have created their own way to create policy surrounding bitcoin, but each state has a different way of handling regulation. Bills and laws vary from the newly created Bitlicense in New York to North Carolina’s recent virtual currency framework. There’s also been the recent Coinbase tax probe by the IRS and court cases in Florida and New York shedding light on definitions. Interestingly enough these court rulings can’t decide on whether bitcoin is a commodity or form of currency. In Europe, the central bank has proposed virtual currency legislation to the European Council and Parliament. Authorities detail the main focus is to curb funding terrorism and tax evasion within the region. The European Central Bank (ECB) also is having a hard time figuring out regulation and the classification of bitcoin. The ECB and other regional banks were told by the European Banking Authority in 2014 not to get involved with virtual currencies until authorities figured out regulatory standards. In 2015 the European Court of Justice had declared that bitcoin transactions were exempt from consumption tax. Now EU bureaucrats are steadily moving toward some type of regulation, but like the U.S. they have no idea what to do. Then there are the constant rumors of a country “banning bitcoin” spread by some news outlet or a staunch politician. Just recently it was Colombia, in the past Russia, China, Mexico, and many others have supposedly banned the cryptocurrency. However, nothing typically materializes from these prohibition scares and the threats from bureaucrats never come to fruition. No one knows how to proceed with regulations towards bitcoin because it’s an extremely difficult task. As growing interest in bitcoin escalates regulators are sure to clamp down on trying to apply law to this decentralized protocol. Most likely the only people who will be affected by these policies are those who use traditional banking onramps and offramps with their digital currency use. Another factor to consider is whether or not bitcoin is ownable which has significant implications towards future legal frameworks and regulation. For instance, the bitcoin protocol is basically numbers held on a digital ledger which puts forth questions concerning intellectual property (IP) and property rights in general. The Austrian economist and author Konrad S. Graf has written many articles on bitcoin monetary theory and one that specifically covers this subject. Graf’s book “Are Bitcoins Ownable?” delves into property rights, IP wrongs, and legal theory implications. The fact of the matter is governments worldwide really can’t regulate bitcoin, but they can manipulate the existing financial system’s rules. At times this may hamper people’s abilities to participate, but global cryptocurrency proponents and developers are creating ways to circumvent the nation state’s restrictions. The fact of the matter is governments worldwide cannot stop an idea whose time has come, but they sure like to try.

2017-01-03T15:00:38-04:00,"Localbitcoins’ Growth 85% 2016, Signaling Further Use of Bitcoin",Kyle Torpey,https://news.bitcoin.com/localbitcoins-growth-85-2016-signaling-further-use-of-bitcoin/,"For those interested in tracking the progress of bitcoin as a true form of money, an interesting data point to watch is the global Localbitcoins volume.  There are a variety of different metrics people use to track the adoption of Bitcoin. Some simply track the bitcoin price in terms of US dollars, while others prefer to watch the number of on-blockchain transactions per day increase over time. According to coin.dance, the weekly Localbitcoins global trading volume increased from just under $10 million to around $18.5 million over the course of 2016 (excluding the holidays). Also read: Russian Authorities Ban Localbitcoins, Contradicting Previous Statements To be clear, it’s always difficult to figure out why people are using bitcoin because the very nature of the digital money does not directly attach real-world identities to the transactions on the network. Having said that, there are some interesting aspects of the Localbitcoins experience that make the weekly volume chart worth watching. Localbitcoins is basically a place where buyers and sellers of bitcoin can meet to make trades locally or over the Internet. Users are not forced to share their personal information, which means bitcoins can be bought and sold more privately, and the fact that a long, drawn-out signup process is not involved means bitcoins can be purchased without waiting a few days for approval from an exchange. Due to the relative privacy and and convenience offered by Localbitcoins, prices there tend to be higher than what’s found on Bitfinex or any of the other major bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin buyers are essentially willing to pay a premium to get fast, relatively-private access to bitcoins. People who want to use Bitcoin quickly and privately tend to be the people who aren’t having their needs met by the traditional financial system. For example, someone who needs to make a ransomware payment may not be willing to wait a few days before being able to purchase some bitcoin via their bank account because they’ll lose access to their files forever if the payment is not made by a certain time. Additionally, users of darknet markets, such as AlphaBay, can appreciate the added privacy of meeting up with someone in person to exchange cash for bitcoin. In some situations, Localbitcoins may also be the only option for buying bitcoin, which is usually a sign that the local region’s current financial system is not very accommodating for a variety of other use cases. The growth in global Localbitcoins volume seen in 2016 came from both developed and developing countries. Steady growth was seen in western nations, such as Australia and the United States, and the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa). The country that saw the largest growth in Localbitcoins trading volume in 2016 was Venezuela. In the case of western, developed nations, it is assumed that the Localbitcoins volume accounts for those who are trying to avoid KYC and AML regulations when obtaining their bitcoins. That sort of activity also likely takes place in the BRICS countries, but the state of traditional financial systems in these countries may also play a major role. Localbitcoins is the highest volume exchange for trading between bitcoins and Russian rubles. This particular trading pair saw its weekly volume triple over the course of 2016. South Africa was the only BRICS country that saw a decline in Localbitcoins trading volume over the course of 2016, although the volume there is still about as much as India and Brazil combined. Venezuela saw the largest growth out of any country in 2016, with an increase from 26 to 276 bitcoins traded per week on Localbitcoins. This increase is much more notable when factoring in bitcoin’s US dollar-denominated price rise over the course of the year. Of course, Localbitcoins doesn’t tell the whole story when it comes to non-KYC bitcoin trading volume. There are many other alternatives to Localbitcoins, which include everything from the Local Trader feature in the Mycelium bitcoin wallet to something as simple as Facebook groups. Many buyers of bitcoin on Localbitcoins also often move off of the site after completing a few successful trades with their counterparties. An argument can be made that these sorts of P2P trades are the “real” bitcoin economy, as those who use something like Coinbase do so mostly as a way to speculate on the bitcoin price. If the entry and exit points into Bitcoin continue to see increased regulation and oversight, it could help further develop the bitcoin economy because people will be more likely to stay in bitcoin rather than moving in and out of the digital cash.

2017-01-03T06:00:37-04:00,Bitcoin’s Quirky Genesis Block Turns Eight Years Old Today,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-quirky-genesis-block-turns-eight-years-old-today/,"Today is the eighth anniversary of the bitcoin genesis block, and a lot has happened since the digital currency’s birth. The genesis block was the starting point for the bitcoin blockchain on its path to becoming a revolutionary network for peer-to-peer transfers of value. Also read: Meet Tumblebit: The Unlinkable Payment Hub On January 3rd, 2009 Satoshi Nakamoto unleashed the genesis block into the wild. The genesis block contains the first 50 BTC block reward and cannot be spent by anyone. The bitcoin software was released on Sourceforge the web-based service for open source developers. The original Satoshi client was compiled using Microsoft’s visual studio and is written in the programming language C++. Satoshi began building the code in 2007 and was the only developer that made software changes to the bitcoin protocol up until mid-2010.  The first block also includes text from the UK Times newspaper saying “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks,” a reference to bitcoin’s birth-date and possibly mocking fractional reserve banking. With Satoshi’s creation, the total number of bitcoins in circulation will never exceed 21 million BTC. The genesis block has received 1,073 transactions since its inception, with random people adding over 16 BTC to this unspendable address. No one knows why the genesis block was created to be unspendable, as there is no explanation in the Satoshi source code version 0.1. Additionally, the genesis block was hard-coded, and nearly all altcoins derived from bitcoin have this initial unspendable block reward. Satoshi explained that if the bitcoin’s design was to remain static, certain rules like capped supply, the hard-coded genesis block, mining difficulty and reward halvings mustn’t be changed. To this day the design of the bitcoin protocol is important because it’s the base foundation of the entire network. Within the bitcoin network, there is the well-known rich list of addresses holding vast amounts of bitcoin. The list hasn’t changed much over the years, and some of the wallets are believed to be owned by Satoshi. The biggest holder in bitcoin has 124,956 BTC and commands 0.7778% of the coins in circulation. Only three addresses contain over 100 thousand BTC, and the rest contain 79 thousand or less. Some transactions, sent to wallets believed to be owned by bitcoin’s founder, contain messages asking Mr. Nakamoto for donations. However, without tracking transactions down to when Satoshi mined his bitcoin, it is hard to calculate which addresses are owned by the anonymous creator.  Other interesting holders over the years include the U.S. Marshals wallet, which contained bitcoins seized from the Silk Road. Other notable wallets include Lazlo’s pizza exchange or the largest transaction ever that transferred over 500 thousand BTC back in 2011. Another interesting fact is since bitcoin has once again crossed the $1,000 per BTC range there are definitely new sets of cryptocurrency millionaires. For instance, Tim Draper managed to gain nearly $13 million by purchasing bitcoins from the U.S. Marshals. Other notable bitcoin millionaires include Charlie Shrem, Yifu Guo, Jered Kenna, Peter Vessenes, Bruce Wagner, and more. It’s safe to assume there are probably a bunch of new people entering into this realm of wealth as bitcoin have been dispersed over the years. The past eight years has seen bitcoin mature into a billion dollar economy operating without central banks, corporations, or government entities. There are many interesting facts about the network and it’s surrounding community and industry. Here’s a list of ten facts you may not know about when it comes to the history of bitcoin.  The eighth anniversary of the genesis block is a significant landmark on bitcoin’s timeline, but the cryptocurrency is still a nascent technology. It will be interesting to see how the next eight years turns out for the decentralized digital asset.  Whatever the case may be Bitcoin has been a watershed moment in history and remains one of the most innovative technologies since the creation of the internet.

 Access to journals from Dutch publishing giant Elsevier was cut December 31 for scientists in Germany, Peru and Taiwan. Contract negotiations broke down in Germany and Taiwan, while Peru’s government cut funding for the license. Elsevier filed a lawsuit in June against the bitcoin donation accepting Sci-Hub.io. “It’s very unpleasant,” details Horst Hippler, a spokesperson for DEAL consortium, a group of state-funded universities and institutions overseeing German contract negotiations. “But, we just cannot accept what Elsevier has proposed so far.” DEAL wants German-authored articles to be open access. “Taxpayers have a right to read what they are paying for,” says Hippler. “Publishers must understand that the route to open-access publishing at an affordable price is irreversible.” More than 60 German institutions lost access at the end of 2016.  14 universities in the Netherlands raised concerns they would boycott Elsevier if the leading provider of scientific and technical information refused to make Dutch works Open Access, a publishing protocol based on no restrictions. The compromise resolved that 30% of Dutch papers would be open access by 2018. A Finnish group in December settled for a one-year extension after failing to reach an agreement. 75% of Japanese universities have boycotted Elsevier, says National Taiwan University of Science and Technology (NTUST). CONCERT, representing more than Japanese 140 institutions, announced December 7 it would not renew its contract, citing high fees.  Peru-based researchers will lose access due to funding cuts. “I’m not worried. Downloading papers is rather easy now with Sci-Hub,” a plant biologist, who wished to remain anonymous, told Nature.com.  Many researchers hold misgivings about turning indefinitely to illicit means for procuring papers, though many authors themselves make their papers accessible without cost. Sci-Hub dubs itself “the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to research papers.” It’s fueled by bitcoin donations.  A New York district court ruled October 28, 2016, that services like Sci-Hub and the Library Genesis Project are in violation of US copyright law. The suit was brought by Elsevier in June against the site operators for unlawful distribution of copyrighted works. The site, which works also as a Tor hidden service, was forced to move to a new provider after the injunction. Sci-Hub founder, Russian-based Alexandra Elbakyan, is a former neuroscientist born and raised in Kazakhstan. Ms. Elbakyan, who goes by the online moniker ‘ringo-ring,’ could face legal repercussions in the US. Global internet services can face legal repercussions in the US when it serving US citizens.  “Sci-Hub’s and Libgen’s scheme to reproduce and distribute copyrighted works poses a significant threat to book and journal publishing and to authors and scholarly societies reliant on the royalties derived from sales and subscription income,”  claimed the Washington DC-based Association of American Publishers (AAP). Sci-Hub repository houses approximately 58 million papers. Online since September 2011, the site openly advocates for the “cancellation” of intellectual property and copyright laws on scientific and education resources.  Critics of Sci-Hub’s methods say that multinational, corporate publishers like Elsevier will not be hurt by such piracy, but, rather small scholarly societies and non-profits. Ms. Elkabyan disagrees. “The problem are paywalls, and Sci-Hub is a tool that solves this problem,” Ms. Elkabyan wrote on her blog, enginuering.  She adds: “Before Sci-Hub, all research on a massive scale was closed behind paywalls, and now anyone can access it! It will be impossible to shut down the website completely, so that change is forever…[T]he effect of long-term operation of Sci-Hub will be that publishers change their publishing models to support Open Access…” Ms. Elkabyan refers to Sci-Hub as a ‘non-profit.’ The repository has received more than 78 bitcoins to its current public donation address, according to Blockchain.info. That’s more than $75,000 at current market value. What do you think about Sci-Hub.io? Is it piracy? Is it freedom? Let us know in the comments below.

2017-01-02T12:00:32-04:00,The Bitcoin Constellation Is Bigger Than Most Realize,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/the-bitcoin-constellation-is-bigger-than-most-realize/,"When most people think of bitcoin, they look at the price and its billion dollar market capitalization. However, bitcoin’s ecosystem is bigger than most people can imagine with its constellation of significantly growing micro-economies. Since bitcoin’s inception over the years, the cryptocurrency has created a massive economy of people who work directly with this protocol every day. This includes miners, software developers, startups, artists and writers, and many more groups and individuals who help build this infrastructure every day. Also read: Meet Tumblebit: The Unlinkable Payment Hub Miners   Bitcoin has created a growing industry within its mining sector. This includes individuals and organizations who are mining the currency daily and securing the network at the same time. Moreover, there have been companies created that manufacture mining devices, ASIC chips, and more, creating a very competitive industry. Mining has grown exponentially over the years as technology has progressed. New improvements in ASIC hardware and the creation of mining pools have built a robust economy within the bitcoin community. Due to its technical aspects mining is still a niche market, but is expected to grow significantly in the future. Software Developers Even beyond the bitcoin space, the need for software developers is in high demand. Yet as the cryptocurrency grows more popular, the network is creating lots of jobs for programmers dedicated to blockchain and digital currency technology. Many companies and promising startups are looking for software developers to help build code that is focused on the bitcoin protocol. While searching job sites like Monster and Indeed, the most prominent jobs needed in this space are blockchain programmers who understand bitcoin. The economy of developers bitcoin has created will likely increase vastly over time as this type of work will constantly be needed. Digital Currency and Blockchain-Based Startups As bitcoin has grown, many new companies have appeared aimed at harnessing this technology. Over the past few years alone there have been a plethora of startups building businesses with all kinds of unique ideas. Companies focused on bitcoin-based remittances, payment processors, bill payment solutions, atm manufacturers, hardware production, and many more types of businesses. Many of these startups are creating businesses modern society has never really experienced before until bitcoin came along. Exchanges, marketplaces, distributed autonomous organizations, prediction markets, and more that are truly peer-to-peer and decentralized. Cryptocurrency and blockchain focused startups are sure to continue with quite a few of them failing and some becoming very successful. Art, Network Marketing and Writing   Bitcoin’s economy has also given life to graphic artists, marketers, and writers. The industry surrounding the bitcoin environment needs people to create written descriptions, advertisements, and graphic visuals to help spread adoption. Since bitcoin was created, it has seen an abundance of occupations in these fields. Graphic artists have created visuals that help portray this technology in a different manner. Meanwhile, freelance writers have found employment from cryptocurrency news outlets and blogs. These types of marketing jobs are a part of a commercial trade that is mainly focused on the bitcoin protocol, community, and the technology’s branched solutions. A Multitude of Occupations and an Emphasis on Security   Other occupations that fill the bitcoin economy include consultants, accountants, human resources, risk managers and more. Moreover, people often turn to advisors for help to grasp these emerging technologies. This brings the need for consultants teaching people about the industry, software, and the risks and benefits of these protocols.  Another significant market growing within the bitcoin environment is the security sector. Cyber security and creating new methods to secure digital assets will always be needed. Improvements in technology and malicious hacks like ransomware continue to prime the online security sector. This bolsters more individuals and groups working on improving multi-factor authentication, biometrics, threshhold signatures and many more concepts of heightened security. The bitcoin protocol has created a robust system of transferring wealth without a third party but security solutions will constantly need improvement. There are important micro-economies tethered to the bitcoin environment. As bitcoin continues to gain mainstream adoption and reaches critical mass, these smaller economies will swell indefinitely. Additionally, the bitcoin constellation of economies should continue to branch out with more participatory opportunities for individuals and groups. Watching bitcoin grow in its earliest phases is very reminiscent to the birth of the internet era. As time gradually continues, bitcoin’s changes to society may become more subtle but watching these micro-economies multiply has shown things are changing fast.

2017-01-02T06:00:11-04:00,Why Volume Is Exploding at Mexican Bitcoin Exchange Bitso,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/why-volume-is-exploding-at-mexican-bitcoin-exchange-bitso/,"The peso has steadily declined in the past three years and today sits at twenty-to-one to the dollar amid a period of economic uncertainty. In a nation of 120 million, 80 million lack access to basic financial services; that is, no banking and no credit.  Mexico does, however, have 100 million cell lines. 80 percent of the phones sold in 2015 were smart phones. In short, Mexico is a highly connected country. Mexico is also a very “young” country (the median age is 28 years old). For perspective on this growing bitcoin market, the Bitcoin News team spoke with Bitso President and co-founder, Daniel Vogel. Bitcoin.com (BC): Why is volume exploding at Bitso?  Daniel Vogel (DV): Mexicans lack access to financial services. They’ve started to discover bitcoin and use it in their daily life. The use-cases are varied. People make payments in e-commerce, for instance. These are Mexicans without credit cards, bank accounts, and who have been excluded from e-commerce until bitcoin. We see males between 16 and 21 making $20 purchases of bitcoin once every six weeks. After doing research, we found these were young adults without credit cards, who were fans of gaming platforms they couldn’t buy before bitcoin. One of the largest manufacturers started accepting bitcoins, and we experienced a rush of young guys who literally didn’t even know what bitcoin was. It was their only way to make payments for these platforms.  BC: Can you tell us more about Bitso’s customers? DV: We break down our clients into different segments. We have roughly five different segments. All of them growing.  There are people investing in bitcoin for savings. These people understand diversification. It’s very difficult for them to save as a Mexican. You can’t have a US denominated bank account. Investing small amounts of money in Mexico’s stock exchange is nearly impossible. The second segment use it as a way to access payments like e-commerce. Maybe they saw Microsoft accepted bitcoin. You get people who understand after their bank has denied them of a credit card many times.  The third segment trade bitcoin and cryptocurrency for speculation. We these think this use-case is least interesting, as you can trade any commodity in the world. But we need these people. They bring liquidity. They improve prices. We’ve seen an increase in this activity.  The fourth segment is remittances. We have a number of people who have started to rely on bitcoin as a way to send money to Mexico. When you send money into Mexico with bitcoin, you practically get paid for doing so because the demand, and premium, is so high. This small but growing use-case includes one interesting example in Chicago, in one of the most Mexican neighborhoods or streets there, called eighteenth street. You can find a bitcoin ATM there. People send bitcoin to Mexico with this machine.  The fifth segment will likely see a big increase in 2017; that is, people building products on top of our exchange, and who rely on bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Sometimes they don’t even advertise to their customers they use bitcoin for cross-border transactions, business-to-business.  BC: How has the peso’s plight factored in?  DV: Mexico’s currency has significantly devalued against the dollar in the past six months and over the course of several years. For those living in Mexico, there is no access to investments protected from Mexico’s volatile financial system.  There is a lot of uncertainty in the Mexican markets with the recent election of Trump. Questions arise for the Mexico economy: ‘What does this mean for NAFTA, remittances, trade, and commerce?’ That uncertainty has made the peso the weakest it’s looked since the nineties. Some understand they can hedge Mexico economic risk with bitcoin. We’ve seen increased demand there. If you look at the price on our platform, it’s higher than the equivalent price in the US due to buying pressure within Mexico. BC: What role does poverty in Mexico play in bitcoin adoption? DV: I think it’s helping adoption. There’s no way to save in anything that does not have systemic risk with the mexican economy, and bitcoin provides that. The day of Trump’s election, the peso plummeted. The Mexican stock market plummeted.  We are seeing more interest from diverse players, from highly sophisticated family offices that want to invest in this technology, this currency, as an asset to not as wealthy or sophisticated individuals who get the basic concept of seeing the Peso devalue. Mexican students, too, who are studying in the US at a four-year college or two year master degrees, but their savings are consistently devalued. We allow people to purchase starting at two dollars worth of bitcoins and less, which people take advantage of. BC: What is the outlook for bitcoin’s legality in Mexico? DV: Over last year we have been meeting with regulatory authorities in Mexico – the central bank, the Ministry of Finance and the Banking and Securities Commission. We have been very open with what we are doing, and educating them. We get a mixed reaction.  We’re working on regulation with the authorities, and we still don’t know what to expect. We have meetings lined up with regulatory bodies in January. We are optimistic we will receive regulatory clarity. We still operate in a gray area, which is how most exchanges have operated.  The recent growth in transaction volume in Mexico, I think its indication to authorities we need to look into this very seriously, and very quickly.

2017-01-01T19:00:10-04:00,"A Look At Bitcoin Bubbles, When Will the Next One Be?",Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/look-bitcoin-bubble-will-next-one/,"There have been four noteworthy bubbles in bitcoin’s life when the price exploded after rising slowly. Being speculative in nature, the bubble may soon burst, sending the price crashing down before settling at a range above the pre-bubble level. Bitcoin.com examines past bitcoin bubbles and explores when the next one could be. Also read: China has been leading the latest bitcoin bubble  The first bitcoin price spike occurred on July 12, 2010, on the first bitcoin exchange, “The Bitcoin Market” after an article about Bitcoin Version 0.3 appeared the day before on a popular news site, Slashdot. With a flood of new bitcoin users, the exchange’s bitcoin price jumped tenfold, from $0.008/BTC to $0.080/BTC over the five days period. Following the spike, MtGox launched where the price quickly settled to $0.06/BTC. On MtGox, bitcoin’s price peaked on June 8, 2011, to a new high of $31.91, widly believed to be due to the Silk Road marketplace gaining popularity. However, it quickly dropped off and began a slow decline, decreasing in value by over 93% over the next four months.  Prior to the April bubble, the US Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) issued guidance on digital currencies on March 18, 2013. The following day, a new version of bitcoin, Bitcoin Version 0.8 was released and soon the Internet Archive started accepting bitcoin. This drove the price of bitcoin above $30 and took bitcoin market cap to a new high of $1 billion. All the good news fueled a price spike which occurred on April 10, 2013, amid the backdrop of the Cyprus haircut protests. The price continued to climb, surpassing $100 for the first time. However, the new high of $266 on MtGox soon crashed to under $60 before slowly returning to the $120+ range.  After many months of Mark Karpeles running a pair of trading bots called Willy and Marcus who faked volume at MtGox, speculation grew rampant. Bitcoin’s price skyrocketed to the all-time high of $1,242 on November 28, 2013. However, users soon discovered that could not withdraw their money while the price on MtGox dwindled down to $0 throughout February 2014.  However, unlike the previous bubbles, there were three other major USD exchanges this time around. Prices at Bitstamp, Bitfinex and BTC-e, where people could make withdrawals, took a big hit but never fell to their previous lows. At Bitstamp, the peak was lower than MtGox, at $1,163, which did not fall below $400.  Among many speculations was one by Mike Casey Sr. BI Developer at General Motors who recently wrote a blog post analyzing bitcoin bubbles. While speculative in nature, he provided compelling and detailed arguments, comparing bitcoin price charts to the Gartner Hype Cycle, the S-curve, and Fractal mathematics. He claims that bitcoin bubbles largely follow the hype cycle “because the nature of bitcoin investment is almost entirely speculative. Speculation is driven, in large measure, by hype.”  Like a fractal, the chart between the April 2013 spike and the November 2013 spike mirrors the chart between the November 2013 spike to the present, on a smaller scale. Casey hypothesized that the upcoming spike will take a similar form. He also noted that we are currently in a phase where the price gradually makes its way back up to the old high price. “Once the price reaches a sustained level of 80–90% the old peak, the bubble cycle typically starts over again with another bull run,” he wrote. After much analysis, he said “I anticipate we have one more plateau,” which is “likely around $900.” Finally, he speculated that: When do you think the next bubble will be?

2017-01-01T15:38:43-04:00,"Bitcoin Breaks $1,000 as Exchanges Break Volume Records Worldwide",Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-breaking-1000-as-exchanges-break-volume-records-worldwide/,"Bitcoin is making waves globally as it broke through the psychologically important $1,000 barrier on several large exchanges today Sunday, 1 January. It had already broken all-time highs in several currencies as global bitcoin exchanges reported record-setting monthly volume. Bitcoin’s price has increased more than 120% since the start of 2016 alone.  Also Read: Why Bitcoin’s Triumphant $15B Market is Just Getting Started Bitcoin’s exchange rate versus the US dollar crossed the $1,000 mark first on the online exchange Bitfinex on Sunday evening GMT. Shortly, that line was crossed also at Bitstamp, after the exchange rate had reached 1005 USD per bitcoin at Bitfinex and 1000+USD per bitcoin at Kraken and Coinbase among other sites. Bitcoin’s new highs also meant a new market capitalization record above 16 billion USD and an 87.8% dominance compared to all other coins, on Coinmarketcap. The last time Bitcoin hit $1,000/USD was in November 2013, amid wholly different circumstances. Bitcoin did surpass the $1,000/USD mark in Chinese yuan terms as Chinese volume hit record highs already back in December, but did not cross that mark on large “western” exchanges like Bitfinex, Bitstamp and Kraken until Sunday. Analysts theorize that Chinese capital has moved into bitcoin to get around capital controls and a devaluing yuan.   Bitcoin also broke all-time record highs in euros around the Christmas holidays, as well as the all-time high in Brazilian reals, according to data provided by Mercado Bitcoin. Online forums and chat services like Twitter and Reddit were ablaze with celebratory comments and exclamations marks around the new highs. Amid the December excitement, Barry Silbert, founder/CEO of Digital Currency Group, tweeted that “it’s happening,” assumedly referring to global adoption.   In the Middle East, Bitoasis tweeted that December had already broken the exchange’s monthly volume records. “December has been our best month yet since launch,” tweeted Ola Doudin from BitOasis, a Bitcoin exchange based in Dubai. “We broke new daily volume records…” In Mexico, Mexico bitcoin exchange Bitso reported new records as Bitcoin soared passed 20,000 pesos. “Another monthly record for @Bitso! More transaction volume this December than 2014 & 2015 combined,” tweeted Pablo Gonzalez, Bitso CEO.  Bitcoin has only gained more legitimacy since its 2013 record price run. Not only are massive financial institutions and multinational corporations researching and developing systems in part inspired by Bitcoin’s blockchain, but Wall Street hedge funds trade Bitcoin itself today, as well.  The 2013 rally took place amid thin trading volumes. For example, just 7 million bitcoins changed hands among traders in December 2013. 113 million coins have traded hands so far in December 2016.  Although well-known figures in the cryptocurrency space have suggested the mainstream media is oblivious to bitcoin’s price gains, others note that much discussion about the recent price rise focuses just on how high the price will go. “The media continues to speculate what the reasons for the rise might be, but enthusiasts already know,” a senior market analyst at trading platform eToro, Mati Greenspan, told Business Insider on Wednesday. “They’re simply speculating about how high it will go.”  On CNBC’s Closing Bell December 28, analysts discussed if Bitcoin was the new gold; i.e. a new ‘safe haven’ asset, a type of instrument generally seen as protecting one’s portfolio from economic uncertainty.   Now that Bitcoin has crossed the $1,000 threshold, conversation around the cryptocurrency as a new safe haven is sure to continue. Why is the Bitcoin price increasing in your opinion?

2017-01-01T12:00:14-04:00,American Black Cross Helps Political Prisoners With Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/black-cross-political-prisoners-bitcoin/,"An organization called the American Black Cross is a recognized 501 (c)(3) nonprofit dedicated to helping U.S. political prisoners. The charitable group was inspired by the Ross Ulbricht case, whom many believe is a political prisoner incarcerated for victimless crimes. As the new year approaches, bitcoiners can donate to this cause that helps a growing population of imprisoned people. Also Read: Free Keene Launches Bitcoin Radio Commercials The war on drugs has devastated the lives of many people and their families. Since the beginning of the “Say No to Drugs” campaign in 1980, the U.S. prison population has multiplied by five times. Statistics detail that nearly 86% of the federal prison population in the U.S. are incarcerated for victimless crimes. A victimless crime can incorporate a drug offense, public disorder, or any illegal action that does not directly violate other citizens. In October 2013, Ross Ulbricht was arrested for the victimless crime of operating the Silk Road marketplace, which sold contraband mostly consisting of narcotics. Many people within the cryptocurrency and libertarian communities believe that Ulbricht’s trial was unfair and his prison sentence that followed very extreme. Ulbricht received a double life sentence without the chance of parole for hosting a website that sold drugs. Because the family believes they witnessed a legal atrocity they have been relentlessly fighting for their son’s freedom and the millions incarcerated for victimless crimes. “As we close out 2016, we want to remind you that among the ways you can help Ross is by making a tax-deductible donation to the American Black Cross,” explains the Ulbricht family. “The creation of this 501 (c)(3) organization was inspired by Ross’ case. It is dedicated to defending American political prisoners, sadly a class of people that is rapidly growing.” The American Black Cross’ mission is to help people incarcerated for opposing the U.S. government. The organization accepts both credit card and bitcoin donations that are directed towards legal aid, and defense funding towards criminal cases where civil rights have been infringed. Political prisoners or family members can submit a request for assistance from the Black Cross. “If you are under indictment or represent an individual imprisoned in the course of resisting the federal government, and you believe your case may have a substantial impact beyond the interests of its litigants, please submit a request for assistance,” details the American Black Cross. “Submissions are considered by our Review Committee on a regular basis, and if we believe we can offer you assistance or funding, we will make contact with you.” The 501 (c)(3) nonprofit charity founded in 2015 consists of a network of volunteers and activists focused on “defending the prisoners of American Imperium, their humanitarian relief, and to the abolition of the country’s industrial prisons systems.” Black Cross explains they act as a civil liberties defense organization focused on defending those who have opposed the government via the internet. The nonprofit’s current project is committing funds and resources towards the legal efforts of Ross Ulbricht. Black Cross calls Ulbricht’s conviction bitterly unjust and aims to help the ongoing appeal. A lot of people within the cryptocurrency community support the Ulbricht family and the Free Ross organization. This is because many believe the Silk Road was an inspirational stab at the nation state’s totalitarian policies. Furthermore, the investigation, Ulbricht’s arrest, the server takedown, and the double life sentence are questions begging for answers. The server takedown alone begs the question of how far federal investigators can go without warrants regarding criminal investigations involving the internet. A lot of people hope the drug war will someday come to an end, but unless we as a people fight for our sovereign rights, the rules of sociopaths will continue to reign.

2017-01-01T06:00:38-04:00,Coming Up: Drop Zone – a Hyper-Local Bitcoin-Based Market Service,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/coming-up-drop-zone-a-hyper-local-bitcoin-based-market-service/,"There have been many attempts to create a working decentralized marketplace using cryptocurrency for transactions. Projects like Bitbay, Syscoin, the NXT marketplace, and Openbazaar have gained attention over the past few years building this vision. However, another concept announced back in the spring of 2015 called Drop Zone remains in the background. The proof-of-concept may offer yet another method of operating a censorship resistant marketplaces in the future.  Also read: The Digital Revolution Increases Sovereignty There are a few concepts within the bitcoin community which seem to be coveted killer applications. This very much includes ideas like the decentralized exchange and marketplace. After the takedown of the Silk Road back in October 2013, the decentralized marketplace concept became more of a focus. A few notable projects have taken on the task of bringing this idea to fruition. One concept that has been introduced called Drop Zone is a project that hasn’t seen much adoption but could still prove useful in the future. Back in March 2015, an anonymous person operating under the pseudonym Miracle Max introduced a new idea to the Cryptography mailing list. Drop Zone is a decentralized marketplace platform written on top of the bitcoin protocol. The project remains unfinished for the time being, but a released version of the code written in Ruby is available via Github and Rubygem. Miracle Max details that Drop Zone offers a functioning command line for “the selling, buying, and facilitation of secure messaging between buyers and sellers using nothing but the Blockchain and testnet.” Drop Zone claims to be a solution to censorship. When a seller wants to sell a good, a brief description is uploaded to the blockchain. Buyers searching for goods search items located close to their location. Drop Zone’s creator says, “goods are announced next to an expiration, a hashtag, and if space permits, a description. Once a buyer finds a good in a defined relative proximity, a secure communication channel is opened between the parties on the Bitcoin test network (‘testnet’).” Communication between the two parties on the testnet allows negotiations to be finalized, and the seller pays the buyer via the bitcoin mainnet. When payment is complete, GPS coordinates are revealed, and the buyer can proceed to pick up the good at the pre-agreed upon location. The concept removes the third party risks associated with contraband sales, or any sale for that matter, and the entire operation is piggybacked on top of the bitcoin network. But Drop Zone also has several vulnerabilities that need to be addressed as well. Drop Zone’s weaknesses are pretty significant with issues like reputation selling and Sybil attacks. This means reputations could possibly be manipulated or spoofed within the marketplace framework. Another issue, unresolved sales and dispute resolution, could prove pretty difficult. Furthermore, the white paper explains Drop Zone is vulnerable to non-fungible transactions, URL identifiers being centralized, and asymmetric risks to buyers. The concept, very much in its earliest phase, has yet to be fully released to the public. It is a unique localized idea with regards to decentralized markets. There isn’t much of a user interface, but the code could be tested if two parties wished to experiment with this protocol. Back in August, Miracle Max said he hopes people look into developing this environment stating: I spoke with software developer and Bitcoin Uncensored host Chris DeRose who spoke with Miracle Max before he disappeared from the Drop Zone project. Max has gone quiet explains DeRose who plans to start hacking away at the code which may possibly bring him out of the woodwork again. “After TNABC I should have most of my distractions removed, and I intend to travel to Asia where I’ll be working through a Drop Zone GUI that’s both usable, and hosted as a static resource hosted on Github pages,” DeRose details. “Drop Zone has a lot of promise, not only in terms of solving problems, but also demonstrating the efficiency of blockchain: censorship resistant storage. I’d like to see the notion of what a blockchain application is changing from ‘decentralized penny stocks,’ to open software that uses bitcoin at a data layer for solving real-world problems.” The decentralized marketplace idea will come to life in the future, and it’s safe to assume many types of different trade arrangements will be made. Projects like Openbazaar have been gaining popularity and progressing. There are also many Silk Road offshoots within the darknet realm, but most all of these markets are centralized. Drop Zone may prove to be yet another way people can obtain censorship free trade and sell whatever they want. Bitcoin’s technology once again could help push forward the attempt to free the markets worldwide. What do you think about the Drop Zone concept? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-31T12:00:51-04:00,14 Industry Luminaries (and an Ode) on the State of Bitcoin 2016,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/14-luminaries-ode-state-bitcoin-2016/,"Call them what you want; dignitaries, pundits, bigwigs, luminaries or – even – enemies. There are always headstrong debates raging on in the Bitcoin space, and some people’s names get tossed around more than other’s. We decided to reach out to a few of them and ask them a simple question. Also read: Remittance-Demanding Countries Dominate Bitcoin Searches in 2016 Bitcoin has been on a tear all year long, surprising many mainstream spectators. The digital asset has outperformed all sovereign fiat currencies, and gold, over the past year. There have been many headlines – both negative and positive –surrounding the bitcoin space, with the cryptocurrency trucking forward without looking back. Alongside this, the community has been feverishly discussing the block size, segregated witness (SegWit), fungibility and privacy. At the time of writing, bitcoin is valued at $960 USD, and it is the cryptocurrency’s highest price point in over three years. Moreover, adoption is growing fast as bitcoin becomes more popularized in regions like China, India, Venezuela, and Russia. As more and more people continue to use the cryptocurrency for solutions like remittances and escape from capital controls, bureaucrats globally are seeking to regulate digital currency use. This can be seen in many countries such as the U.S. with the country’s tax agency the IRS looking to probe American bitcoin usage.   Many people have their different opinions on the state of bitcoin currently viewing the network from their subjective valuations. Bitcoin.com decided to reach out to a wide range of well-known cryptocurrency community members and ask them one simple question: “How would you summarize the current state of bitcoin as the year 2016 closes?”  What we got back was everything from a single line of observation to a whole ode on the fascinating developments. Here’s what a few those Bitcoin proponents within the community had to say: • “2016 was Bitcoin’s Year of Distraction. Attention was instead directed at the undefined abstractions (“Blockchain,” “distributed ledger,” “Ethereum”) which constitute Bitcoin’s competition. This exploration and experimentation is normal for a new industry. However, in 2017 users will demand tangible, concrete results (actual cost reductions, actual sales). As the competition fails to deliver, the attention owed to BTC will be repaid…with interest.” — Paul Sztorc, Hivemind developer • “So this year basically I think was a ‘State of Unstable Coins.’ We had the core and classic teams battling it out, new proponents entering the ring like Rootstock. And there was so much buzz about this thing called blockchain that it kind of blinded everyone for a short bit towards the early and middle of the year with all these institutional players taking an interest in the technology, but as we got towards the later half of the year and the bitcoin price climbed to $700, the focus came back to bitcoin — not as much the blockchain. It’s like there is a fork in the industry to figure out where this is all going while there is such uncertainty about the big players in the industry.”— Lisa Cheng, Vanbex Group  • “I’ve been excited about bitcoin for nearly six years now, but there are more reasons to be excited about it now than ever before.” — Roger Ver, Bitcoin’s first Investor, owner of Bitcoin.com • “I saw a nice quote this morning from Quartz. “Bitcoin doesn’t care what Silicon Valley thinks.” Bitcoin doesn’t care what anyone thinks. I remember a conversation with Mike Hearn in 2013 where we were discussing bitcoin, and I asked him about where he thought the price was going. He said, “Bitcoin does what it does”. This technology has seen a dramatic increase in visibility and experienced both the good and bad sides of the limelight: rising interest among corporations and investors, alongside more regulatory scrutiny, and uncertainty. There is much in-fighting and disagreement among developers which amplifies this uncertainty. It’s at this time, more than ever before, that the global community is needed to ensure a prosperous and well-balanced future for the technology.” — Moe Levin, Founder of The North American Bitcoin Conference • “In my opinion, the state of bitcoin is tumultuous but hopeful.” — Dmitry “Rassah” Murashchik, Mycelium • “Bitcoin in 2016 is like a teenager sending off college applications or one of the last gunslingers of the Old West: the technology has emerged and is starting to move forward and stand on its own, but it is still a new and immature space with lots of risk and pitfalls. Overall, as this technology matures and marches toward adulthood we will see more opportunities for impact and more evidence of its amazing potential.” — Bruce Fenton, Atlantic Financial  • “I’m thrilled to see the end of this calamitous year, but through it all the one shining light has been the undeniable, unstoppable march of bitcoin. With the healthy consolidation within the industry, the rollout of SegWit and Lightning Network, the rise in price, the all-time-high global interest in bitcoin seen on Localbitcoins, and the dawning realization by many that an open, public blockchain is superior to private imitations — I feel very positive that bitcoin is going to continue to chug along quite nicely in 2017 and beyond.”— Brooke Royse-Maller, Bitcoin Mom  • “2016 was the year of true colors. Most of the bad actors have dropped off, and those that remain are revealing that they’re out of their weight class. The good actors, by which I mean, devs, companies, miners, and users who want bitcoin to succeed in the long term, continue to soldier on. I am especially in awe of the devs, who under vile political conditions, and without pay, are still able to produce sound code. What most people don’t realize is that bitcoin has problems beyond block size, and I look forward to seeing if segwit can begin to resolve them.” — Julia Tourianski, Brave The World • “Venezuela and India have proven why an alternative to a nation’s currency must exist. When governments abuse their monetary power, bitcoin provides a vent to the suppressed. Being able to transfer wealth with no intermediaries is what bitcoin is all about. Understanding this simple fact is challenging, but I think reporters are beginning to grasp it. Actually, bitcoin will save the entire news industry as micropayments will fill the holes of declining ad revenues.” — Datavetaren, Software Engineer & Computer Scientist  • “What a fun year! We kicked it off with wild announcements from R3, Ethereum, Onecoin, and Dash that their visions are the certain future—and, as usual, that Bitcoin itself was old news. By the year’s end, the numbers were in—and Bitcoin was still on top (way, way on top). So, as the scammers pivot to DLT’s and ICO’s as the new cure for whatever ails you, the honey badger just treks onward. While buzzwords and faces change with the season, for Bitcoin’s veterans, surprises are few and far between.” — Chris DeRose, software developer, Bitcoin Uncensored host.  • “Bitcoin’s cold winter on tales of Mike Hearn
Emboldened the bankchains, made hodlers churn;
As scaling unfolded, emotions did run, and so
Did investors to Ethereum.
 Spring’s ether rally became summer’s crash
As the magical DAO hack made off with the cash,
Hacked too was Bitfinex, but they made a coin
To create out of air a virtually settled purloin. ICOs thundered down from the heavens at will.
Iconomi, First Blood, they all had their fill.
Waves begat Incent, Golem sold quick.
Steem rose, Waves rolled in, ZCash was slick. Then quietly the halving, and large miners fled
As more academics pronounced bitcoin dead.
But honey badger don’t care and November arrived,
So we’re approaching the moon launch from $975…“
 — Michael Terpin, co-founder and chairman of BitAngels • “Bitcoin is the most valuable open-source project ever created. A new global monetary system, always on, with developers providing continuous improvement and repairs while it is still running. Many have compared it with attempting to repair an airplane while in flight. To have the debate in private would have been pointless. We have to discuss and repair Bitcoin in the public because it is the public that uses Bitcoin. Did we develop a few black eyes because of the debate? Sure, but we also came up with a solution and that was the reason we had the debate in the first place. We are still trying to make the world better by providing a safe and stable money that completely censorship resistant. — This is not a simple or easy task. In fact, it has never been done before. But that doesn’t mean that we will stop, or give up. Bitcoin struggles, but survives. We have been through hard times, but there is a light at the end of the tunnel. And it’s not a train. It’s the moon. To the moon!” — Thomas Hunt, Mad Bitcoins • “Getting ready for the mainstream… 2016 painted in numbers: Inflation halved to 4%, price doubled to meet it, markets shook off 2014-15 FUD and engaged FOMO. Liquidity grew 6x while risk halved to 6%, now approaching fiat levels. Meanwhile network capacity red-lined to 98%, forcing for the first time a demand-driven fee market to emerge, already 10% of miners revenue.” — Willy Woo, cryptocurrency investor and founder of Woobull. • “In 2016, we witnessed hashing at an exahash/second level. At its essence, Bitcoin is simply a protocol and the battle for a standard is a protocol battle. Altcoins come and go, but who wants to use the world’s 2nd most secure blockchain? Even though Jan 9th 2017 will be 8 years since the genesis block, Bitcoin is still unmasking statists.” – Jon Matonis, Founding Director at Bitcoin Foundation. Bitcoin.com wants to give a special thanks to all of the bitcoin community members who participated and responded to our question and we wish them and all of our readers a happy new year. 2017 is sure to be another interesting year for bitcoin.

2016-12-30T19:00:25-04:00,Still Time to Make Bitcoin Donations and Give Less to the IRS,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/still-time-to-make-bitcoin-donations-and-give-less-to-the-irs/,"The US Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has committed to cracking down on bitcoin users that may have been evading paying taxes. However, there is still time to make charitable donations to your favorite charities and thereby give a little less to the tax man. Also read: IRS Demands Coinbase Records In Surprise Tax Probe  For federal tax purposes, the IRS treats bitcoin as property, not currency. Taxpayers are required to report all bitcoin-related income, whether it be from wages, gifts, mining or investments. While some bitcoin income may go undetected by the IRS, exchanges such as Coinbase are required to report all bitcoin transactions to the agency. Tax planning at year-end can save taxpayers a substantial amount of money. Among the various methods to reduce tax obligations is to make tax-deductible donations to charities. Many nonprofits now accept bitcoin donations such as BitGive, and United Way, Save the Children, and Greenpeace. However, before donating, make sure that the organization is an IRS-approved nonprofit. Otherwise, the agency can void your tax deduction and slap you with penalties as well as the taxes owed. Bitcoins held over a year are considered long-term holdings by the IRS. Tax attorney Elizabeth Prehn with Moskowitz LLP explained on Virtual Currency Today that “Bitcoins held for over a year can be donated directly to charity without having to pay any capital gains tax.” In addition, she said: With bitcoin price at its all-time high recently, tax deductions could make a difference for your overall tax strategy. Bitcoins held for less than a year are considered short-term holdings by the IRS. Taxpayers cannot write off the full market value of each bitcoin in this case. If short-term held bitcoins are donated directly to charities, “only the lesser of their cost basis or their present value can be deducted,” Prehn said. For example, bitcoiners who purchased bitcoins in January at $450 may be able to only write off that amount, rather than the current price of over $950 at press time. For those who want to donate bitcoins held short-term, Prehn suggested: Of course, in most cases, not selling your bitcoins at all may be the best option to avoid paying the IRS in general.

2016-12-30T12:00:50-04:00,How to Use Bitcoin to Become a Perpetual Traveler,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-use-bitcoin-to-become-a-perpetual-traveler/,"This past spring the creator of the Dollar Vigilante publication and podcast Jeff Berwick gave instructions on how to become a perpetual traveler and legally avoid paying taxes. Berwick is an anarcho-capitalist that believes a government is an unnecessary evil and that taxation is theft. Bitcoin is one tool that can be utilized to accomplish the goal of not paying taxes and a great currency for people constantly traveling. Also read: The Digital Revolution Increases Sovereignty Over the course of the past few decades, people have been questioning government and taxation. Many believe that taxation is essentially theft because it is imposed by indoctrination, force, and coercion. Berwick is a firm believer of this philosophy and that taxation funds “mostly war, which is murder, it funds giant communist style bureaucracy — and most of it wasted and destroyed and actually creates all sorts of problems in the economy.” Berwick explains how the anti-taxation movement is growing by describing the perpetual traveler concept. The idea was first popularized by Harry D. Shultz and refers to people spending time in different countries to avoid civic duties, taxation, and increase the aspects of overall freedom. The perpetual traveler (also PT, permanent tourist or prior taxpayer) idea has grown more popular says Berwick and many people are learning the ins-and-outs of this lifestyle. Living as a perpetual traveler is not easy and also requires moving wealth around in different ways. Relying on counter-economic activities such as barter and trade, utilizing cash under the table, and the use of cryptocurrencies can also be beneficial. Hiding wealth these days from prying eyes is difficult with concepts like FACTA and entities like the NSA. However, using these techniques can help avoid taxation if applied correctly. Cash and barter are probably the easiest ways to avoid taxation, but bitcoin can also help if the right steps are taken. This means users should buy and sell the digital currency anonymously as much as possible. Cryptocurrency proponents can use protocol applications like coin shufflers and tumblers that are currently available and hide their location using applications like Tor. There are many people who believe the fundamentals of bitcoin can help avoid taxation. Last year Defense Distributed founder Cody Wilson explained to me that without these principles like avoiding taxation bitcoin is “nothing of a revolution.” “Without a big expression of intentionality to what are considered not the polite things to do with Bitcoin — specifically money laundering, specifically private access to your coin, holding your own keys — without projects that express these principles, you have nothing of what you want with a revolution,” details Cody Wilson. “This leaves me to proclaim that most people involved with Bitcoin were not serious about that in the first place.” Furthermore many others believe cryptocurrencies will help add privacy and anonymity in order to progress these principles. These ideas have furthered development in the crypto-space with alternative digital currencies like Monero, Dash, and Zcash all hoping to bring true anonymity to the digital environment. This past June the infamous whistleblower Edward Snowden explained the cryptocurrency Zcash might be a solution towards bitcoin’s surveillance risks. A few months later in November Snowden further implied these types of privacy-centric currencies could help avoid taxation. Snowden explains via Twitter stating:    The world is changing, and many people are researching different ways of creating a voluntary society without the use of force and coercion. Libertarianism, Anarcho-Capitalists, and many other types of groups are forming to accomplish this goal worldwide. Furthermore, people are learning to build voluntary governance models using digital currency solutions with projects such as Bitnation. It’s safe to say that Berwick is not alone with the belief that taxation is theft and there must be better methods of funding infrastructure voluntarily. Bitcoin has ultimately shown the world what the separation of money and state looks like. This is a milestone for society as it has given many people the idea that government can be separated from literally everything. This can be seen with the popularity of blockchain based voting models, distributed autonomous organizations (DAO), and many more concepts that remove third party interference. The idea of becoming a perpetual traveler or prior taxpayer is slowly becoming an acceptable practice and bitcoin can help promote this philosophy.

2016-12-30T06:00:50-04:00,Bitcoin’s Inverse Relationship to the US Dollar Is Breaking Down,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-inverse-relationship-to-the-us-dollar-is-breaking-down/,"Despite the dollar’s 2016 gains and year-end rate hike, Bitcoin still outpaced the global reserve currency in 2016 in price terms. Bitcoin’s “inverse relationship to the Dollar” seemingly no longer persists.  Also Read: Here Are Bitcoin’s 8 Fastest Growing Markets Record low interest rates between December 2008 and December 2016 created unprecedented economic conditions globally – in fact, the only economic conditions the cryptocurrency Bitcoin, which was released January 2009, had ever known. “Since its inception,” itBit writes in an August 2015 report when the federal funds rate remained at a record low 0.25%, “Bitcoin has existed in a zero interest rate environment. This may soon change as the Federal Reserve appears close to raising interest rates…” When the Federal Reserve finally increased its benchmark interest rates December 14, just the second time in ten years, the quasi-public institution signaled a strengthening economy. Central bank officials increased the federal-funds rate by a quarter percentage point, to between 0.50% and 0.75%, citing in particularly an improving labor and employment market, as well as a rate of inflation which was moving towards target levels. Throughout 2016, the perception of Bitcoin as a ‘new safe-haven’ persisted. Thought around the cryptocurrency had held that, if the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates, bitcoin’s perceived use as protection against economic uncertainty may be diminished. Its price may then fall.  But, despite the dollar’s 2016 gains and year-end rate hike, Bitcoin still outpaced the global reserve currency in 2016 in price terms. Bitcoin’s “inverse relationship to the Dollar”, as itBit discussed in its 2015 report, seemingly no longer persists. The first, tiny bump in the Bitcoin chart above represents the 2011 dip in the USD chart below. Correlations become rougher over time. For instance, the US Dollar, during bitcoin’s price increase to its all-time high, traded sideways. In the present day, each is in bull cycles. In his December 27 post, South Africa Shark Tank shark and Bitcoin investor Vinny Lingham discussed the reasons he believed Bitcoin had increased so dramatically throughout 2016. He cited the recent fed interest rate hike as one. “…[M]ost misunderstood and not often cited – the recent fed rate hike which puts pressure on emerging market currencies, strengthens the dollar and in turn creates a surge in the forex/BTC trading price,” Mr. Lingham, who is known for cogent Bitcoin predictions, writes. “This in turn creates additional foreign buying and demand for Bitcoin as a forex hedge, particularly outside the US, because the price of Bitcoin in that country is rising quickly.” Mr. Lingham argues that when the US dollar surges, currencies in emerging markets are devalued, increasing demand for, and the price of, bitcoin. Markets such as Venezuela, Indonesia, Colombia, Malaysia are currently among the fastest growing markets for Bitcoin. “…Essentially, the higher the rates go, the higher the demand for Bitcoin will be,” he writes of emerging markets. When the Fed raises rates next depends on its economic outlook for 2017. Fed officials do expect to raise rates next year by another 0.75 percentage points, possibly in three-quarter point nudges upwards.  This could then indeed lead to a further increase in the value of the dollar, a devaluation of emerging market currencies, and increased Bitcoin demand in affected emerging markets.

2016-12-29T12:00:38-04:00,New Image Hosting Service Pays Thousands of Uploaders in Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/new-image-hosting-service-pays-thousands-of-uploaders-in-bitcoin/,"Image hosting is one of the latest applications that bitcoin has improved upon, thanks to one-month-old Supload. The service shares advertiser revenues with its users in bitcoin. Bitcoin.com reached out to Mike Reilly, Supload co-founder and website programmer. He recently announced that his site paid out “nearly 2 BTC worldwide to our users, including many first time Bitcoin users.”  Also read: Here Are Bitcoin’s 8 Fastest Growing Markets  Supload is an image hosting service much like the popular website Imgur. It allows users to upload photos such as memes and animated gifs to their board, hosting them for free. Users are then given unique links to share or to insert their images into social media sites such as Reddit and Facebook. The main difference is that Supload pays its users 50% of its profits generated from ads displayed on its website. There is a $1.00 minimum to withdraw. However, once earnings are finalized, bitcoins can be withdrawn at any time, according to the site. Since payouts are typically very small, the fees charged by traditional payment services such as Paypal would make the business model unviable. Bitcoin’s ability to send mass payments with small fees is what convinced Reilly to help create the site. He told Bitcoin.com: In the one month of operation, the service is off to a strong start. “The user base is around 2000 users since we launched a few weeks ago on Reddit,” Reilly said, adding that “around 70% of the users are active.” While the site grows both in users and new functionality, Supload’s marketing has so far been posting in social media communities that use a lot of images such as Reddit. This tactic has helped them find new users for both their service as well as for bitcoin. Reddit user “ttwtf12” said “Amazing site, this is what got me into Bitcoin” after the payout announcement. “Always been confused as to how Bitcoin works and been hesitant to step in, but this site enables you to earn some bitcoin first and then see how it goes,” he added. Even when directly paying users to use their free service, the competition from other image hosts is formidable. Imgur is the biggest website that hosts images online. Website statistic service Quantcast estimates that Imgur currently has 79.7 million unique visitors per month and 2.6 billion page views, ranking it around the 50th most popular website in the world. It remains to be seen how many of those tens of millions of people will prefer doing what they do in exchange for bitcoin over at Supload instead. At the very least, some of them will be introduced to bitcoin. And who knows, Imgur may start using the cryptocurrency to share their revenue with users too. Reilly and his partner created the service to help bitcoin grow. “The future for the site is going to be focused on that same goal,” Reilly explained. “We started out with the goal of making Bitcoin easier to obtain for users all over the world by doing things on the Internet that they are probably already doing,” he revealed. He is also planning various upgrades on the site, including more earning-focused features. “There will also be a social aspect to the site that will reward users satoshis for completing activities,” he said. As soon as they are ready, the duo has big plans for the service to compete in some other huge markets as well. Reilly noted: Do you think Supload will take off? Let us know in the comments section below.

2016-12-29T06:00:29-04:00,New Features in Opendime’s Next Cash-Like Bitcoin USB Stick,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/new-features-in-opendimes-next-cash-like-bitcoin-usb-stick/,"When Opendime made its ‘bitcoin stick’ with multi-signature Bitcoin wallet provider Coinkite, it called it a ‘Bitcoin bearer bond’ – that is, a bond or debt security. The controversial product, much scrutinized in 2016 by Bitcoiners, experienced concerns over counterfeiting, as well as its closed-source nature. The company has responded to the counterfeiting concerns in Version 2.0, due in February 2017. Also Read: The Opendime Bitcoin Stick Review Opendime Version 1.0, a small USB stick that purported to allow one to spend bitcoins like a bearer instrument (which are unregistered; without records of ownership and transactions) by passing along a stick, was much discussed in Bitcoin forums in 2016. Another example of a bearer instrument would be a paper dollar bill.  Even Craig Watkins, a Bitcoin core wallet maintainer, analyzed the wallet in a long thread on Github about the legitimacy of the ‘bitcoin stick’, in which users lamented the ironically closed-source nature of the Bitcoin hardware device. One could check the balance on their USB by connecting to a device. Opendime announced, on December 27, Version 2.0 of their bearer bond, and it could mean that a version 2.0 of ‘bitcoin cash’, improving upon popular but ink-dependent paper wallets, is coming to market in 2017. To allay some user concerns, Opendime will add a special security chip to “defeat any attempt at building counterfeit or cloned Opendime” copycats. The company, which is accepting pre-orders and plans to ship Version 2.0 in February, also announced new external designs including a new unsealing mechanism, a lanyard hold. Opendime highlighted first a security upgrade to the ‘Bitcoin Stick.’ The newly-integrated Atmel ATECC508A chip can hash the SHA-256 encryption model, the same encryption grade Bitcoin uses, do true random number generating (TRNG), and sign public keys (ECDSA) on the NIST 256-bit curve “P256.”  The chip, which contains a number of secret keys impossible to extract, holds a “factory key” that only Coinkite factory knows – an aspect of the design sure to make Bitcoin purists nervous.  “We will publish the public part of this key, and you can use the signatures that this chip makes to verify that you are connected to a real Opendime,” the company states in its press release. “It will also verify that it’s a unique device and that it’s paired to the microprocessor that it was originally built with.” By integrating ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman) security protocol, the Atmel security chip could make Opendime an “ultra-secure method” for operations like encryption/decryption key agreement. The chip also uses ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) for sign-verify authentication purposes.  “With ECDH and ECDSA being built right in, this device is ideal for the rapidly growing IoT market by easily supplying the full range of security such as confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication to systems with MCU or MPUs running encryption/decryption algorithms,” according to Atmel’s website.  Atmel states that the security chip “employs ultra-secure hardware-based cryptographic key storage and cryptographic countermeasures which are more secure than software-based key storage.” The new ‘bitcoin stick’ security chip is optional to verify, but “you can be 100% sure that you are talking to a genuine Opendime” if it is, according to the company. Opendime markets their product as a “digital piggy-bank.” This is because, in order to access the bitcoin, the stick must first be opened. While Version 1.0 used a long tab in the board’s center, the new model entails sticking a paperclip or wire into a small hole on the back. “With a firm jab, you will break the seal that’s on the other side and unlock the Bitcoin in the device,” the company states. “Selling out our Opendime V1 batch of a few thousand units validated the USB credit stick concept,” CEO Rodolfo Novak told Bitcoin.com. “We believe that with the improvements in Opendime V2, we will make an even bigger dent in the Bitcoin off-chain physical transaction and privacy markets. Aside from typical in-person exchanges (i.e. LocalBitcoin) in the West, current developments in capital controls in places like India present a huge opportunity for the “better world currency” (Bitcoin) to flourish. Opendime makes Bitcoin accessible to non-tech users who will take advantage of these opportunities.” Bitcoin News reviewed the Opendime “Bitcoin Stick” in August 2016, then dubbed by the company “The First Hardware Bitcoin Bearer Bond.”  A simple to use and easy to understand model enables Opendime to function like cash and also perform ‘off-chain’ transactions (by handing it over). The small design precludes the existence of a screen, but even then the product should be easily understood by a novice, and that’s what perhaps makes it an enticing advent. Before it’s to be recommended by bitcoiners everywhere, the ‘bitcoin stick’ is likely to undergo continued scrutiny, in particularly for its closed-source design and centrally stored private keys.

2016-12-28T19:00:30-04:00,Bitcoin is Tapping Into the Laws of Nature – Part 1,Mike White,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-tapping-laws-nature-part-1/,"Although it is on the cutting edge of technology bitcoin might be more closely aligned with nature than we think. This series of 3 articles compares how bitcoin and the legacy financial systems stack up against the laws of nature. In this first piece, we cover survival of the fittest, along with the concepts of CANI and being anti-fragile. The essence of survival of the fittest is competition. Nature does not care how long you have been the top dog. If a better competitor comes along you are toast. Bitcoin succeeds or fails on its merits. It is 100% voluntary and competes openly against all forms of exchange, including government issued currencies (fiat) as well as the many alternatives to bitcoin fighting for a piece of the action. Bitcoin will survive as long as a market believes it has value.  If it can’t demonstrate value or adapt to serve its environment, it will die. Fiat money is basically money created and administered by a government like the US dollar, Euro, Aussie Dollar, Yen etc. Although you could argue that fiat does compete with other currencies on a global scale, it effectively holds a monopoly within its own country. It has value mainly because citizens are forced to use it. So, as far as most people on earth are concerned, there is no competition for their national currencies. An interesting point to note is that the average life of a fiat currency is 27 years before it collapses! Gold, on the other hand, has been used as currency for over 5000 years. The oldest fiat currency in existence is the pound sterling. The pound has been around for 322 years but has been off the gold standard since 1931. Even though bitcoin has been declared dead many times, it has not missed a beat for almost 8 years. Also read: The bitcoin network death that never happened In nature, this fight for survival promotes constant and never-ending improvement (CANI). CANI is basically the ability to continually do more with the same resources than you could do before. In 1903 the Wright brothers took to flight and now we humans are working to colonize Mars. More practically, a company only stays in business by selling products which offer more value than their competitors. Bitcoin is designed to obtain more purchasing power over time. This is achieved by the fact that there will only ever be 21 million bitcoins. The money we use today, however, is printed at will by whichever government holds the key to the printing press and is designed to become less effective over time. Governments continue this practice despite the fact there are no examples in nature where a system survives by becoming less effective. When you think about it, “becoming less effective over time” is actually a definition of dying. Governments have their own agenda but many classically trained economists will argue that money needs to become less effective (in the form of inflation) to encourage spending and spur the economy.  If this was true, no one would ever buy a computer because we know it will be cheaper next year. Furthermore, if these economists were anywhere near accurate in their “professional opinion”, AAPL, GOOG, and MSFT wouldn’t be the 3 highest market cap stocks on the NYSE. Also read: Could Bitcoin Break the Petrodollar Monopoly and Bring World Piece What doesn’t kill us makes us stronger. When we get sick, our immune system attacks the virus and builds up a defense. The next time we catch the same virus, it doesn’t affect us as much. This is what is meant to be antifragile.  Being programmable money, bitcoin is antifragile as well. The bitcoin of 2009 is vastly different from the one we see today. Bitcoin effectively has a $14 billion bounty on its head and is attacked every day and the attackers have never succeeded. Even though it is technically “possible” that bitcoin will be hacked, many believe you would have more chance of internally combusting within the next 2 seconds. (Note: bitcoin exchanges like Mt Gox and Bitfinex have been hacked but this is akin to a bank robbery not hacking the Federal Reserve) The US financial system is not antifragile. Actually, the Federal Reserve has been successfully hacked over 50 times in the last 5 years. SWIFT, an international banking network which transfers over $5 trillion worth of payments a day has been hacked 3 times in last few months! These attacks are succeeding at an increased rate. This tells us hackers are getting better at breaking into these systems faster than the legacy system can keep up. Having a look at the discussion so far, bitcoin is certainly more in line with nature than the legacy financial systems. Stay tuned for Part 2 of this mini-series where we look at the differences in how innovation is accomplished in nature when compared to bitcoin and the legacy system.

2016-12-28T12:00:33-04:00,One of These 5 Hyperinflating Economies Could Adopt Bitcoin in 2017,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/one-of-these-5-hyperinflating-economies-could-adopt-bitcoin-in-2017/,"Fourteen countries have inflation levels above 18 percent right now, 10 of which are rising at press time. Bitcoin prices and new user adoption have spiked several times in the past during economic turmoil such as banking bailouts and hyperinflation.  Also read: Bitcoin 2016: the Year of a Different Rise  2016 had more than its share of global economic turmoil, but 2017 is also ramping up to be a major year of suffering at the hands of poor monetary decisions. In March 2013, banks in the country of Cyprus gave a ‘haircut’ to their customers’ bank accounts, causing a public outrage. Bitcoin’s price subsequently jumped five-fold in a few weeks, possibly due to people seeking economic safe-havens as well as speculators. Since then, several other economic blunders have caught the public’s eye, such as the Greece bailout, the Brexit vote, Venezuela’s crushing hyperinflation, and India’s demonetization. Each case was accompanied by a dramatic rise in bitcoin’s price as new investors chose to use the cryptocurrency as a safe-haven asset. Indeed, experts in mainstream news have already commented about bitcoin’s abilities to be a safe-haven asset like gold, or even a better one. According to TradingEconomics, a service that compiles inflation rates, fourteen countries have inflation levels above 18 percent right now, 10 of which are rising at press time. Of those 10 countries, five are wealthy and technologically proficient enough for their citizens to use bitcoin as a safe-haven asset, should the current trends hold into 2017. Venezuela’s money problems are still advancing. The country was showing a staggering 181 percent inflation rate per month at the end of last year, according to latest statistics by TradingEconomics. The service estimates the country’s inflation rate to stand at 410% in 12 months time. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) however predicts an inflation rate of 1,600% in 2017 for Venezuela. It “only” takes 50 percent inflation per month to be deemed hyperinflation, according to the World Bank. To make matters worse, as soon as Venezuelans return from their holiday break, their 100 bolivar bill, their largest banknote, will become worthless as well in an attempt to combat money hoarding. 2017 is poised to be a painful year for Venezuelans.  Thankfully, the country already has a large and growing bitcoin community. The government also gives away free electricity so mining bitcoins there has been an excellent source of income for those who can get mining equipment. It may only be a matter of time before the conditions force enough Venezuelans into bitcoin before creating some sort of tipping point in 2017. The tiny, Dutch-speaking republic of Suriname, a couple of countries to the east of Venezuela, is also having its own hyperinflation problems right now with a ruinous 77 percent inflation rate that is still rising. High levels of corruption have been blamed for the staggering economic hardship this is causing. Like their suffering neighbors to the west, the Surinamese are technologically ready for bitcoin today with an enormous 175 percent mobile phone penetration.  There does not appear to be a bitcoin community in the country yet, unfortunately. The nation is so small, however, that if one were to start up soon, there may still be time to spread bitcoin to a considerable portion of the half-million residents. The South African republic of Angola is among the many African nations currently experiencing uncomfortable levels of inflation, recorded at 44 percent monthly last year when they were last published. Blessed with vast petroleum and mineral reserves, the seventh-largest country in Africa has become China’s largest supplier of oil and one of the world’s top-five sources of diamonds as well. Angolans also enjoy great mobile phone coverage and the quality of life there is far above most of their neighbors.  Today, bitcoin is relatively unheard of in Angola, but a small number of people are using Localbitcoins in the country. Another South American country that has been flirting with hyperinflation for years is Argentina, which has passed 40 percent inflation rates this year for the first time in decades. The current situation in Argentina is shaping up like the last time hyperinflation destroyed the currency in 1990. 
The otherwise-advanced country already has a very strong bitcoin community and Uber drivers in the country accept bitcoin for passenger fares already. The heavily populated western African nation of Nigeria has a lot of good reasons to look at Bitcoin. TradingEconomics predicts they will graze 20 percent inflation in the first quarter of 2017, although growth seems to be slowing for now. More importantly, unlike nearby countries Kenya and Uganda, the trend of mobile money adoption through services like M-Pesa have skipped over Nigeria due to unfair laws that penalized telecom companies in favor of the local banks.  Nigerians have a 107 percent mobile adoption saturation with a huge population of 150 million subscribers, almost as large as the United States. A type of mobile money that the banks and politicians can’t stop, especially during such strong inflation, might really be able to make a difference for many Nigerians.

2016-12-28T06:00:39-04:00,Why Bitcoin’s Triumphant $15B Market is Just Getting Started,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/why-bitcoins-triumphant-15b-market-is-just-getting-started/,"Bitcoin has had a triumphant year this 2016 reaching a milestone market capitalization of over $15 billion during the end of December. It’s nice to mention that the digital asset has been one of the top performing currencies worldwide, beating many commodities as well. But what’s really worth pointing out is this phenomenon has happened without governments, corporations, or any central authority. Also read: Remittance-Demanding Countries Dominate Bitcoin Searches in 2016 Bitcoin came along shortly after the global economy crashed in 2008, with central banks printing vast amounts of fiat reserves and bank bailouts becoming a common sight. It’s been over eight years since the genesis block was released into the wild and bitcoin has come a long way. At first, the digital currency wasn’t taken very seriously but over time people curated the cryptocurrency’s value by using it as a medium of exchange. In the early days, one notable transaction was the purchase of two pizzas for 10,000 BTC. As bitcoin continued to gain value over the years there have been many ups and downs. Mainstream media continuously portrayed the digital asset in a negative way and exchange losses like the Mt. Gox bankruptcy didn’t help much. But bitcoin shook off all the bad press and showed that it just didn’t care. Over the course of a few more years, bitcoin’s underlying technology, the blockchain, became the focus of traditional market incumbents. However, while “blockchain” was hyped by the current banking cartel, bitcoin’s public block chain [Satoshi’s original spelling, Editor’s Note] continued to shine as an investment vehicle and economic safe haven. Many countries worldwide have been suffering from capital controls directed by authorities, and hyperinflation spurred by central planners. Bitcoin has helped many around the globe circumvent these economic problems by letting people utilize it as a peer-to-peer digital asset. Towards the end of 2016, bitcoin’s popularity and price value had increased significantly, becoming one of the best investments of the year. There are many reasons to why bitcoin has done so well. But the foundations of the digital asset’s value can be found in the fact that it is decentralized, peer-to-peer and open source by its very nature. This is why demand is so strong when countries like China tighten capital controls because citizens find a way out with bitcoin. When India demonetized certain rupee denominations, residents have flocked to bitcoin to battle the cash crisis within the region. Furthermore, in countries like Venezuela suffering from hyperinflation, residents have found solace in bitcoin’s current store of value. Besides economies worldwide dealing with hardships, the cryptocurrency has brought forth vast amounts of innovation. Concepts like smart contracts from the likes of Rootstock are being built, and social media applications such as the Yours network promise new applications for Bitcoin. Alongside this, there are now many reputable exchanges and wallet providers creating different ways to trade and store bitcoins more safely. Bitcoin’s innovative technology has given new meaning to decentralized governance, voting, and a great variety of subjects that affect our lives. Bitcoin has produced the means to accomplish these ideas in a whole new way. The digital token has come a long way since gaining parity with the dollar, silver, and once again approaching the value of one ounce of gold. There have been many times bitcoin’s price has corrected where many considered it a crash. But stability has gotten considerably better over time and the cryptocurrency suffers way less from volatility. No one is quite sure how governments and central banks will deal with bitcoin in the future. We know that authorities are trying their best to craft regulations and enforce rules against certain use cases. However, the community is creating various ways for bitcoin to be more fungible and less trackable by state and non-state actors. The milestone of bitcoin’s $15 billion dollar economy is great because there is no technological innovation quite like bitcoin. It’s the first medium of exchange of its kind to reach this feat and will continue to test society by changing the financial precedent worldwide.

Italian bank stocks have plummeted drastically since the referendum and it comes at a time where the digital asset bitcoin is seen by investors as a safe haven. Furthermore, Chinese bitcoin interest has grown exponentially as the yuan devalues and the country faces economic uncertainty. Also read: How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet for Your Needs Many economies worldwide are facing scary times. One particular event that has stirred the global economy was the Italian referendum held on Sunday, December 4 that changed the composition of power within the country. The reform also saw the resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, who was then replaced by Paolo Gentiloni. But the biggest problem was the Italian banking systems’ turbulent situation and imminent economic danger. Italy’s third largest bank Monte Dei Paschi shares fell to their lowest of the year on December 23 with the bank suspending trading this past Friday. In China, analysts believe the country’s capital outflows will continue to rise as the yuan faces daily devaluation. Bitcoin.com recently spoke with Spencer Bogart, Equity Research analyst at Needham & Company who said “to the extent that China further tightens capital controls in 2017 the burden will likely be focused on other more prominent and heavily used channels for capital flight.[…] If so, some capital outflows will shift to other channels, and Bitcoin is a likely benefactor in this scenario.” There are many who believe bitcoin’s price rise is in direct correlation to the Chinese economy. During these economic storms investors traditionally look for safe havens in bonds, other fiat currencies, gold, and other commodities. However this year global investors hear more and more about the safe haven benefits of bitcoin. Mainstream media has been highlighting the fact that bitcoin has outperformed nearly every fiat currency worldwide and has done significantly better than precious metals as well. This past week the news outlet CNBC also highlighted bitcoin’s price surge by pointing to Chinese capital flight. A video episode hosted by trader Brian Kelly, called “China gives Bitcoin a bid”, shows the recent surge of interest towards the digital asset. Kelly explains how bitcoin has reached a new market capitalization milestone outperforming U.S. Steel and Twitter. CNBC’s Kelly also explains how India demonetized 86 percent of the cash within the country. “Bitcoin got demand from that, ” says Kelly referring to last month’s demonetization tactic in India. Furthermore, bitcoin’s scarcity is growing with only 5 million BTC left to mine, Kelly notes. This adds to the speculative value amongst the geopolitical turmoil happening worldwide. With the current demand mixed with bitcoin’s decreasing supply Kelly confirms “it’s not too late to buy bitcoin.” Kelly believes geopolitical reasons surely help the bitcoin price rise but other use cases will be coming in 2017, as well, says the reporter. With countries all over the world having difficulties with monetary central planning, bitcoin is slowly becoming the solution. Global investors have grave fears when it comes to the current banking situation worldwide and increasing austerity measures from governments. It’s hard to keep a positive outlook when the world’s oldest bank comes close to failing in Italy. Italy’s Monte Dei Paschi is currently seeking a government bailout and this decision could shake markets even more. Bitcoin will likely continue to be popularized as a store of value and a great safe haven from these troublesome economic times. There’s no bailouts or central planning, nor can governments or corporations shut the network down. This gives bitcoin a significant value proposition like no other currency or commodity. Bitcoin remains useful because of “classic supply and demand” as one of the most useful financial innovations of our time.

2016-12-27T14:00:17-04:00,Here Are Bitcoin’s 8 Fastest Growing Markets,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/here-are-bitcoins-8-fastest-growing-markets/,"Most countries saw bitcoin volumes surge in 2016, but some markets grew faster than others. Bitcoin.com looked at trade volumes across dozens of bitcoin exchanges to find the countries and currencies with the largest growth during the year. Also read: Bitcoin Blows Past $808 With No Sign of Heartbreak  Japan has the second highest bitcoin trading volume globally after China. Bitcoin trading for the yen surpassed the US dollar in May largely due to Bitflyer’s zero-fee campaigns. According to data from Bravenewcoin, the exchange currently has over 50 percent market share of all bitcoin volumes in Japan. Its daily trading volume grew from 1,845 to 97,815 bitcoins over the year, a 53-fold gain. Other Japanese exchanges are also experiencing significant volume growth. Tech Bureau’s Zaif exchange, for example, recorded over 514 percent increase at press time.  As Venezuela faces greater money supply problems, the demand for bitcoin in the country rises. Surbitcoin is the most popular exchange by volume for the Bolivar, but the exchange does not publish its historic volume data. However, solid growth can be seen by examining trading volumes on Localbitcoins in Venezuela. In the first week of the year, only 22 bitcoins were traded. The volume peaked at 373 bitcoins in October before settling down at 223 bitcoins recently. Overall, trading volume grew by over 913 percent this year.  Indonesia’s Rupiah is the fifth-most traded currency for bitcoins by volume and has seen a huge spike in trade during the block reward ‘halving’ event in June. Ever since, it has remained fairly strong across a few exchanges. The exchange with the most volume in the country is the Singaporean Quoine, with about 90 percent of the current trade in rupiah. The exchange started trading in March and its volumes spiked to 51,500 in June. At press time, its trading volume was 3,344 bitcoins.  The South Korean Won is the sixth-most traded currency for bitcoins globally, and Koreans can buy bitcoins from a large number of convenience stores nationwide. These networks use the exchange Korbit, which hosts over 70 percent of the Korean won bitcoin trading volume. At the beginning of the year, Korbit’s daily volume was 583 bitcoins. At press time, it was 3,168, representing a 443 percent increase.  Venezuela’s next-door neighbor Colombia has started to show signs of life on Localbitcoins. Starting the year off with around 26 bitcoins traded for the week up to 122 most recently, the roughly 370 percent increase is worth noticing.  Malaysia has blossomed most recently, jumping from levels of around 150 bitcoins weekly to 542 last week on Localbitcoins. The 261 percent increase follows years of a very gradual, low-level increase going back to 2013. This indicates a major shift has taken place there, possibly due to new exchange Xbit Asia entering the market this year.  Russian rubles are currently the seventh-most traded currency for bitcoin globally, and almost half of that volume is traded on the Localbitcoins exchange. This year, that one exchange has seen 121 percent growth by itself, rising from 2,705 weekly volume to 5,983. The country has had a tumultuous year with constant questions popping up over whether or not bitcoin is illegal in the country. Amid regulatory uncertainties and banning of Localbitcoins, trading on the exchange has soared. However, new exchanges have recently started up in the market competing with Localbitcoins.  Several exchanges allow bitcoin trading for the Australian dollar. However, after the igot exchange left the Australian market in January, the market dropped from daily trading volumes of 3,850 to around 500 bitcoins. In April, a new exchange, ACX, launched and quickly became the exchange with the most volume. Its weekly volumes are currently well over 12,000 bitcoins.  Which markets do you think will take off in 2017? Let us know in the comments section below.

2016-12-27T06:00:09-04:00,"Halving History Suggests Bitcoin’s Price Is Heading for $11,210",Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/halving-history-suggests-bitcoins-price-is-heading-for-11210/,"Bitcoin’s relative nascence makes its future price perhaps difficult to predict. There objectively is not as much data in the Bitcoin market as there is, say, in the gold market. Yet, there are numerous indicators which lend key insights into bitcoin’s price trends, and one often overlooked is the recurring halving. Also Read: With Bitcoin’s Rise the Altcoin Dominance Index Suffers We’ve seen Bitcoin reach previous all-time highs several times, and in each case (but one) blow past it. As well, we’ve borne witness, and have some data, on two halvings. In 2012, one such halving preceded an all-time high. From July 2011 to February 25, 2013, Bitcoin users looked up to this number: $32. It was, back then, bitcoin’s all-time high. You can see that first bump in the Bitcoin USD all-time price chart just above the date “July ’11”: After matching its all-time high on that aforementioned, fateful day in February 2013, Bitcoin peaked next on April 8, 2013, at $238. That represents a 644% increase once Bitcoin’s July 2011 all-time high had been met. Bitcoin thereafter decreased in price, bottoming out around $69 in early July 2013. In early November 2013, Bitcoin blew by the previous all-time high of $238. On November 29, 2013, one Bitcoin was worth $1,122 (a 371% increase) before a collapse in price and subsequent consolidation. Fast-forward more than three years and many headlines later, and Bitcoin is trading at just over $900, six months after the second Bitcoin halving in July. As Civic CEO and Shark Tank South Africa shark Vinny Lingham predicted, and Bitcoin.com covered, Bitcoin cut right through the $800s. Mr. Lingham plans to publish a blog post when the price of Bitcoin reaches $934. He relayed his short-term thoughts to Bitcoin.com in an email. “Now that we’ve broken $900, I think there should be an expectation of a consolidation at these levels, which will be healthy,” he said. “There may be a micro rally to $950-$975, but will most likely fall back to around $900. I think there is a lot of buying pressure in the 850-900 range which will support a $900+ position. Hard to say though….” If Bitcoin reached its previous all-time high of $1,122, and then increased similarly to the previous time it surpassed an all-time high in April 2013 (371%), that would place Bitcoin at around $5,290 in the near-to-mid-term future. What makes bitcoin price analysis more complex are the technical events programmed into the distributed network. One such major technical event – a Bitcoin block reward halving – took place in 2016. If 2012’s halving is to be used as a benchmark, the Bitcoin price could garner many headlines in 2017. The two network halvings in bitcoin’s almost eight year history probably play more of a role in pricing than is continuously acknowledged in the financial analysis of the Bitcoin price.  In November 2012, the halving propelled interest, demand and disinflationary mechanisms; all which led to a continuation of the price increase, according to many Bitcoin participants.  Bitcoin’s major price gains the following year were well broadcast by mainstream media, with Bitcoin being featured on flagship television shows across the globe. The context of July 2016’s halving has likewise taken place amid attention-grabbing Bitcoin price increases. The correlation and/or causation between these two events are still subject to much speculation.  The halving in November 2012, when the price was $13, preceded the aforementioned $238 all-time high reached in early April 2013 by nearly six months. That’s a 1,731 percent increase from the halving to the next peak, a Bitcoin all-time high of approximately $1,122. The next halving took place on July 9, 2016. On January 14, 2015, Bitcoin traded at $177, it’s nadir since the previous $1,122 high had been reached in late 2013. On the halving day 2016, the price of Bitcoin stood at $648. It had steadily climbed. Its topsy-turvy price formations had by-and-large helped people miss the newly awoken bull.  Since July, when the halving took place, Bitcoin’s price increases have only become more dramatic. Where this current price increase ends is anyone’s guess. 1,730 percent (the percentage price increase after halving 2012) of $648 comes to about $11,210. Where the Bitcoin price ends up, and when it ends up there, is the unknown variable here. Many experts suspect continued price increases. Barry Silbert notes people are not paying attention to the current price increase (though some take issue with this), and Tuur Demeester compared the recent price rise to the above-outlined winter 2013 price increase. We’ve looked at price peaks after previous all-time highs had been reached and what the price did after halving 2012. There are many variables missing, but with the inputs we’ve used, the current price trend could land Bitcoin between approximately $5,290 and $11,860,00.

2016-12-27T04:00:16-04:00,Google Searches for Bitcoin up Over 400% in Venezuela Over the Past Week,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/google-searches-for-bitcoin-up-over-400-in-venezuela-over-the-past-week/,"The economy of Venezuela has been shred apart by a financial crisis resulted from the local government’s decision to demonetize the nation’s largest denomination banknote. However, after a plane carrying the newly printed banknotes failed to arrive, Venezuelan authorities officially declared the previously scrapped 100bs banknotes a legal tender once again.  People have struggled to obtain cash to finance their daily living and according to AP correspondent Hannah Dreier, no one in the country had access to cash for almost two straight days. Consequently, the lack of cash led to the starvation of the general population. Over the Christmas holidays, people died whilst failing to acquire food, medicine and other basic necessities. Hundreds of people have been arrested and some were killed amid fierce protests against the government’s impractical and inconsiderate demonetization of banknotes and destruction of its monetary system. Also read: Remittance-Demanding Countries Dominate Bitcoin Searches in 2016 Such incidents arise when a central entity or authority have monopoly over its monetary system and the country’s money flow. Financial networks and banking systems become unreliable if trust is involved, as seen in the recent catastrophe in Venezuela. People are becoming increasingly aware of the consequences of government-funded and supported banking and financial systems. Until recently, a majority has had to deal with the financial monopoly of the government due to the non-existence of decentralized currencies. However, bitcoin is gradually altering the mindset of the global population across the world by providing people with the ability to gain control of their money and obtain financial freedom. On the other side of the fence, some economists and analysts including former Stanford, Harvard and Berkeley professor Vivek Wadhwa firmly believe the decentralized and anonymous nature of bitcoin have ultimately led to its failure. In a recent article entitled “R.I.P., Bitcoin. It’s time to move on” published in the Washington Post, Wadhwa stated “Bitcoin was born with serious flaws,” describing the unregulated aspect of the digital currency. However, bitcoin has outperformed all currencies and assets in 2016 so far, due to those characteristics that are currently being condemned by economists including Wadhwa and Nobel prize winning professor Paul Krugman. Bitcoin is providing a strong alternative for people that have been abandoned by government-supported monetary systems, banking services and financial networks. It is providing people in Venezuela hope of financial freedom by granting them a store of value that cannot be controlled, monopolized or manipulated by authorities. Eventually, Venezuelans have developed a keen awareness of emerging technologies and stores of value like bitcoin. In fact, over the past week, Google searches for the keyword “bitcoin” in Venezuela rose by over 400%. Some Venezuelans have begun to allocate their capital — which is rapidly losing value due to the devaluation of the Venezuelan bolivar — in bitcoin mining, with hopes to obtain a legitimate currency in bitcoin to purchase goods and items internationally on platforms like Amazon through bitcoin applications such as Purse.io. The rising demand and interest in bitcoin in Venezuela also make the possibility of the replacement of national currency with a digital store of value such as bitcoin likely, considering that the national currency has already lost its value amongst Venezuelans. People are trying anything within their capacity to obtain US dollars, gold and bitcoin to ensure they can support their daily living. Do you think interest in bitcoin will continue to rise in Venezuela? Let us know in the comments below. Images via LA Times"
2016-12-26T03:00:38-04:00,"Bitfury Receives $43 Million Bitcoin Sale Requests, Firmly Declines",Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitfury-receives-43-million-bitcoin-sale-requests-firmly-declines/,"Major bitcoin mining and blockchain technology firm Bitfury reportedly received bids from various investors and assets under management (AUM) funds over the past week as bitcoin price surged past US$800. In response, Bitfury Vice Chairman George Kikvadze firmly declined their offers, stating that the company isn’t and will not be interested in selling their bitcoin in the future. On social media, Kikvadze revealed that the Bitfury group received offers from large-scale and high profile investors as the bitcoin price surpassed the $800 margin. Many analysts and experts including Civic CEO and angel investor Vinny Lingham predicted bitcoin price to go straight to $900 once it hits $800. Such predictions and the rapidly rising demand for bitcoin in countries like China pushed conventional investors to purchase bitcoin. Also read: Bitfury Introduces ‘Flare’ Routing Solution for Lightning Network  Within 24 hours since bitcoin hit the $800 mark, Kikvadze and the rest of the Bitfury group received bids to buy 30,000 to 50,000 bitcoins by AUM funds and high profile investors. As of today, 50,000 bitcoins are equivalent to $43 million. Several bitcoin communities suggested that AUM funds and other investors must purchase funds at exchanges instead of attempting to secure affordable direct deals with miners. A large number of users used the term “the real public market” in referring to the bitcoin exchange market and regulated trading platforms. While conventional bitcoin exchanges and trading platforms are viable and practical to traders and investors obtaining personal funds or investments, it is inefficient for investment firms or large-scale corporations seeking out for multi-million dollar investments in bitcoin. For instance, the largest bitcoin exchange in Korea called Korbit, which has some of the most valuable investors and partners in all of the South Korean financial industry including $15 billion telecommunications company SK and $74 billion investment firm SoftBank, has a bitcoin withdrawal or trading limit of $171,000. Thus, for corporations or investment firms like the AUM funds that submitted their bids to the Bitfury group, purchasing $43 million worth of bitcoin in exchanges that have a trading limit in the range of $100,000 to $200,000 will be inefficient. Bitfury’s official decision to decline all of the submitted bids as well as future sale inquiries is a foreseen for a company that considers bitcoin as a global currency and a store of value. It is likely that the Bitfury group does not see any benefits in trading their assets in bitcoin for cash or any other forms of assets at this time of global economic instability and tightening financial regulations. More importantly, the necessity of cash is rapidly declining with over 39% of the world’s population depending on alternative financial services other than cash or fiat-money based systems like bank accounts and credit cards. In all, the increasing number of bids being submitted by AUM funds and investment firms should be considered as the mainstream and conventional financial industry’s increasing interest in bitcoin. Earlier this week, Digital Currency Group CEO and founder Barry Silbert expressed his enthusiasm in the fact that a small circle of companies and media outlets were covering the surging bitcoin price. However, as seen in the submission of bids to Bitfury, large-scale corporations and investment firms are already attempting to hold bitcoin as alternative assets and global store of value. Do you think more investment firms and AUM funds will be interested in bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-25T19:00:38-04:00,How to Protect Your Bitcoin Privacy and Security Online,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-to-protect-your-bitcoin-privacy-and-security-online/,"In this day and age online privacy and protecting digital data is a pretty big deal. Privacy applies to bitcoin users even more so because they are storing wealth in the digital realm. Governments, hackers, and non-state actors are compromising global citizens private data daily, but there are many steps one can take to protect oneself. Currently, the world is threatened by global mass surveillance from countries participating as the “fourteen eyes,” an alliance of fourteen countries sharing intelligence and people’s data on a global level. Privacy has been attacked by the state, and non-state actors and analysts suggest this will only increase over the years. Within the online world, there are many tactics users can utilize to protect themselves from unwanted snooping. Also read: John McAfee: Wake the F*** up to Consumer Security Threat Privacy-Centric Web Browsers There are a few web browsers that offer better privacy than standard browsers traditionally used by the mainstream. The open source Brave browser is a great tool to block ads and tracking applications. The platform also uses bitcoin incentives to create a better experience. Another recommended browser for privacy is Mozilla’s Firefox which provides confidentiality and security focused extensions. If a person wishes to become even more anonymous then using Tor is a solid choice that hides IP, obfuscates proxies, and encrypts certain aspects of the browsing experience. In addition to the added privacy, Tor allows users to surf websites that are not indexed by Google and traditional browsers. Virtual Private Networks (VPN)     VPNs offer encryption and re-routing practices to change a user’s server location and IP address. Third parties are unable to track the exact location of a VPN user or monitor traffic if the product does what it claims. Make sure you are using a trusted VPN provider as each service offers a different experience and cost. Typically free VPNs are not recommended and researching a vendor is a must. Some services also offer a “logless” feature which ensures even the provider has no access to user data and traffic movements. Privacy-Focused Email Services & Messaging There’s a wide variety of email and messaging services that offer strong privacy and end-to-end encryption. For email services such as Protonmail, Tutanota, OpenMailBox and many others offer encrypted email features. Users can use an OpenPGP encryption standard with their current email service. This type of method provides email encryption, decryption with shared keys, and digital signatures. End-to-end encrypted instant messaging services are also useful to stay private. Services such as Signal, Chatsecure, Telegram, and Ricochet offer different types of private messaging. Users surfing with the Tor browser can utilize TorChat which offers peer-to-peer encrypted messaging. For those who use cryptocurrencies over the web, security is integral to digital asset storage. Malicious hackers are gaining access to people’s wealth every day with people who don’t take responsibility securing their digital currencies. Cryptocurrency theft becomes more common with attackers utilizing social engineering methods to acquire people’s funds online.  Cold Storage Using cold storage practices is an excellent way to keep intruders out of your digital assets. The method entails keeping cryptocurrencies offline and out of harm’s way. Bitcoin and altcoin proponents can store offline using paper wallets, hardware wallets, and other forms of protected media. If you are not using your digital currencies daily then keeping them offline would be the safest choice rather than leaving them exposed on the open web. Multi-Signature Transactions Multisignature (multisig) is a method of using more than one person and keys to authorize a cryptocurrency transaction. The practice is a digital signature scheme that protects assets from being spent without the entire party of signers involved. Bitgo revealed the first multisignature wallet in 2013 and there are other variations available to the public. In essence, a multisignature address contains several ECDSA private keys, and all of them are needed to perform a transaction. Multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Two-factor authentication (2FA) MFA and 2FA are typical standard practices for most bitcoin users. The method confirms the identity of a user by using multiple verifications. Google Authenticator and Authy are well-known services that offer multiple validations. Bitcoin companies like exchanges and wallet services also offer SMS codes to use as 2FA to access their services. Adding MFA and 2FA features to bitcoin applications and accounts is highly recommended. Additionally securing your email that is tethered to an account also protects from malicious social engineering to accounts linked to your email. Backing Up and Securing Seeds, PINs, and Passphrases Most all of these services that ensure privacy and security use passphrases, mnemonic seeds, and PIN numbers to gain access. Backing up these details, so they don’t get lost or forgotten is a good idea. Users should keep copies of handwritten passwords and manage their entry data in a secure location typically offline. If a hardware wallets seed is lost or an account password is forgotten, sometimes people can be totally locked out from their accounts. There is a lot of debate over whether or not password managers are secure and if this type of application is used as a back a user should research with due diligence. Also read: ‘No More Ransom’: A Summer Ransomware Project by Tech Security Giants There are many more methods of privacy and protection that can be used online and with cryptocurrencies. Researching and practicing these techniques will help ensure your digital footprint will not be tracked or attacked in an unfortunate way.

However protecting yourself from nosy governments and hackers looking to liquidate your wealth can be achieved. What types of privacy and security methods do you use online and with cryptocurrencies?

2016-12-25T13:00:39-04:00,Get Ready for 2017 â These Legal Precedents on Bitcoin Were Set in 2016,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/get-ready-for-2017-these-legal-precedents-on-bitcoin-were-set-in-2016/,"2016 saw numerous important court decisions made which affect the Bitcoin industry as a whole. We consulted lawyers and researched the biggest court cases of the year, ranging from whether or not Bitcoin is money to the fate of Ross Ulbricht. Hereâs what weâve found. Also read:Â Chinaâs Proposed New Law Recognizes Bitcoin as âPeopleâs Rightsâ An age-old Bitcoin question returned to the spotlight in 2016: is Bitcoin money? Indeed, contradictory rulings were levied in relation to whether or not bitcoin is money. New York A New York judge decided Bitcoin is money in a high profile case linked to hacking attacks against U.S. multinational financial institution, J.P. Morgan. U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan rejected Anthony Murgioâs attempt to have two charges dismissed in relation to his operation of Coin.mx, in which the prosecution argued the service represented an unlicensed bitcoin exchange.  Murgio argued bitcoins did not count as âfundsâ under federal law in a Manhattan courtroom in September. His argument was denied by the court.  âBitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term,â Nathan wrote. âBitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They, therefore, function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.â Florida A Miami judge, contrarily, dismissed money laundering charges in July. Website designer Michell Espinoza was charged for illegally transmitting $1,500 worth of bitcoins to undercover detectives. The undercover detectives reportedly told Mr. Espinoza that they wanted to buy stolen credit-card numbers.Â  Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Teresa Mary Pooler decided in the case that Bitcoin was not fiat currency nor âtangible wealthâ and âcannot be hidden under a mattress like cash and gold bars,â reports the Miami-Herald. She opined in an eight-page order: âThe court is not an expert in economics; however, it is very clear, even to someone with limited knowledge in the area, the Bitcoin has a long way to go before it the equivalent of money.â  She wrote that Florida law is currently too vague to apply to Bitcoin. âThis court is unwilling to punish a man for selling his property to another when his actions fall under a statute that is so vaguely written that even legal professionals have difficulty finding a singular meaning,â the Miami judge stated. North Carolina Moreover, North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory signed House Bill 289 on July 6, thus expanding the stateâs Money Transmitter Act to cover activities related to bitcoin and other blockchain tokens.  The law was introduced in 2015, and has received criticism despite being drafted with input from blockchain and digital industry insiders with local regulators.  As lawyer Jason Seibert, who represented Trendon Shavers in the case listed below, explains: âI think the best way to describe Bitcoin is actually as a commodity that can be used as money â just like any other commodity.â In July, Bitcoinâs so-called âfirst felonâÂ was sentenced to 18 months. Trendon Shavers, known as pirateat40 in bitcoin forums early on in the cryptocurrencyâs existence, was charged in a case tied to his Bitcoin Savings & Trust operation in which many investors lost money.  Having spent lavishly during his illegal fundâs existence, Mr. Shavers could not repay all the lost funds, though he tried – Â a fact the court took into decision when it came time to sentence the Texas man.  In addition to the eighteen months, Mr. Shavers received penalties such as three years supervised release, a $100 special assessment, $1.2 million in forfeiture and $1.2 million restitution. The IRS sent a John Doe Summons to Coinbase, one of the largest Bitcoin exchanges in the industry. The request asked for records from between 2013 through 2015. Coinbase pledged to fight the request in court. Users of the service filed federal lawsuits in December, aiming to block what they see as the IRSâ overreaching claim. The case, from the Northern California U.S. District Court, believes numerous persons using Coinbase might have âfailed to comply with provisions of the internal revenue laws.â CoinbaseÂ is appealing. On June 13, the New York state financial regulation approved Ripple Labs for the first-issued BitLicense.  The company cleared an anti-money laundering, capitalization, consumer protection and cyber-security review, Â according to the New York State Department of Financial Services.  “DFS is pleased to continue to foster the growth of the New York virtual currency marketplace,” Department of Financial Services Superintendent Maria T. Vullo said in a statement. Ripple filed for the license under its corporate name XRP II LLC, which has received funding from Andreessen Horowitz, Google Ventures and IDG Capital Partners.  The first European-regulated Bitcoin product hit the market over the summer. The Gibraltar Stock Exchange launched a Bitcoin product called BitcoinETI, an asset-backed exchange traded instrument. BitcoinETI is set to available on regulated brokerages across Europe and that regulation of Bitcoin and fintech in Europe is âmore agileâ than in the US.  In Late April, major Bitcoin exchange Bitstamp made the announcement it had received a license to operate throughout Europe.  The Luxembourg Ministry of Finance licensed BitStamp to operate as a payment institution with a license that applies to the European Union as a whole.  âWith this,â says Dan Morehead, the chairman of Bitstamp and the CEO of Pantera Capital, a firm that specializes in investments related to bitcoin, âBitstamp is able to do business in all 28 countries of the EU.â It took Bitstamp about two years to procure the license.  Silk Road oral arguments were heard in 2016, in which the defense posited that the conviction of Ross Ulbricht for operating the Silk Road was a result of a mistrial.  Citing corruption discovered in the case by lead investigators, the defense wants the conviction dropped citing a mal-investigation, but the judge on the case maintains the evidence proving Mr. Ulbrichtâs guilt as overwhelming. Still pending in the court of appeals, with more and more evidence pointing towards corruption of law enforcement officials, itâs not sure whether Mr. Ulbricht will get a chance at a new trial. Surely, more legal precedents were set in 2016, albeit in a quiet manner. Which did we miss? Please, let us know in the comments. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, and Pixabay.

2016-12-25T05:00:44-04:00,Markets Update: With Bitcoin’s Rise the Altcoin Dominance Index Suffers,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-rise-altcoin-index-suffers/,"Since bitcoin’s significant price rise, altcoins have been brushed off to the side as bitcoin’s dominance climbed to 87.4 percent. Altcoin interest has waned as each alternative digital asset has lost market capitalization over the past two months. There are various reasons. Also read: Bitcoin Blows Past $808 With No Sign of Heartbreak Let’s face it: all eyes are on bitcoin’s price movements at the moment. A couple of years ago, altcoins were all the rage as a bearish price decline brought bitcoin to the sub-$200s. Now, as the price of bitcoin increases drastically, many altcoins are suffering from a price decline and lack of interest. This is a stark contrast to the 2013 price rise when some altcoins — most notably Litecoin — received a value lift from bitcoin’s increase. This time cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum, Dash, and others have seen their markets drop in value.  The top ten cryptocurrencies in the digital asset space have held their positions for quite a few months. Many of them still hold significant value and some believe these tokens offer something bitcoin cannot provide. Monero has done well for itself hovering at around $9 per XMR and is gripping the 5th highest market capitalization. This is due to people speculating on its development of anonymity features and its current black market acceptance. However, the trend of concentration towards bitcoin is very noticeable. For instance, today one commenter on Bitcointalk.org asked: “It seems as a whole most of the major altcoins have been declining in value recently. What will reverse this trend?” Another community member acknowledges the trend stating: Certainly, there is a lot of development in the altcoin space, and many projects are testing new features. Litecoin plans on testing the soft fork Segregated Witness before bitcoin. Ethereum has released a new version of the Geth client with its Swarm alpha implementation. With Swarm, the Ethereum network hopes to become more of a Web 3.0 rather than just a cryptocurrency. These features attribute to many people believing in the merits of some altcoins sticking around for the long haul. Even though some altcoins have merit as experiments, many people are skeptical of their usefulness. Not one altcoin network has the sizable infrastructure bitcoin has, and many just use these coins to day-trade. This past September the bitcoin-based payment processor Bitwala wrote a notable blog post exclaiming “nobody uses” altcoins. The company explained the harsh reality by referencing the company’s numbers of processing volumes. Bitwala explained in its recent blog post: Bitcoin remains the dominant cryptocurrency for the time being, and there’s little to show this will change anytime soon. Currently, as bitcoin climbs to an all-time record high in three years and breaks the $14 billion market capitalization, it will be harder for altcoins to compete. Most altcoins are uninteresting forks of bitcoin merely designed to pump and dump.  Other crypto-tokens may have use cases in the future, but bitcoin’s significant lead has trumped thus far. And there are also some bitcoin community members such as Paul Sztorc, and Daniel Krawisz who believe altcoins will never be useful. Krawisz explained in his editorial titled “The Problem with Altcoins” stating: “The Bitcoin community is not just overwhelmingly larger but of overwhelmingly better quality as well. Bitcoin is surrounded by real entrepreneurs working hard to create new and useful services for Bitcoin,” wrote the Satoshi Nakamoto Institute founder. “Altcoins are surrounded by loud-mouthed pretenders with irrational hopes of duplicating Nakamoto’s success. This does not mean that there is anything intrinsically wrong with altcoins: the problem is simply that once Bitcoin exists, then there is no additional value, from a monetary standpoint, of creating knock-offs.” What do you think about the lack of interest in the altcoin index?

2016-12-24T19:00:53-04:00,The Crypto Show Discusses Bitcoin Radio,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/crypto-show-discusses-bitcoin-radio/,"The bitcoin industry has created a growing economy of businesses, miners, artists, writers and radio broadcasts. One particular broadcast is the Austin-based The Crypto Show. It began in 2013, highlighting the cryptocurrency community and its memorable moments.  Recently I chatted with the Crypto Show crew about how they got the show started, and recent events. The guys gave us some insight to their recent Dash proposal, the Free-Ross-A-Thon, and all the fun moments recording cryptocurrency and liberty proponents. The hosts believe we are facing a “Brave New World” and bitcoin will be an integral part of promoting freedom in the future.      Also read: Forget QR Codes, NFC Bitcoin Wallet Cards Are Here Bitcoin.com (BC): When did you guys first come up with the idea to start the Crypto Show? The Crypto Show (TCS): The idea was hatched in December of 2013 at one of the Bitcoin meetups while planning for the first Texas Bitcoin Conference. Harlan came up with the idea for the show.  He was the founder and owner of Brave New Books and had a long history of supporting Logos Radio Network and the FM affiliate TXLR 89.1 fm in Austin, so his connections allowed us to pitch the show to a producer there.  Once we got the show off the ground, Harlan hosted the Bitcoin meetups at Brave New Books for quite some time.  Unfortunately, Harlan leased Brave New Books to a new management team, and the Austin Bitcoin and Liberty community really didn’t embrace the new managers the way they did with Harlan at the helm.  The bookstore was the nerve center for Austin during the Ron Paul campaign and just about everything else over the last ten years.  BC: Can you tell our readers about some of the shows most memorable guests and projects? TCS: The guest list is pretty long. As can be seen here. Roger Ver, of course, is a favorite. He always shines a positive light on the issues we tend to care about. John McAfee is always a blast. I think he likes to plant far fetched stories so that people will run with it and then he sits back and laughs. He’s got a hell of a sense of humor. Of course, Cody Wilson is a frequent addition to the show, and he is without a doubt the most generous person to ever be named “The Most Dangerous Man in Austin.” There is some discussion of possibly moving our studio to Defense Distributed since it’s quickly becoming the new Liberty hub for Austin. The guys at DD are holding workshops to help people with their digital privacy, with the group “Central Texas Mutual Aid Society.” Everyone that works at DD is amazing and feel like it’s their dream job, for philosophical reasons of course. The Kimdotcom interview was very interesting. We had him on to talk about BitCache but instead it became a very revealing account of the U.S. government acting like pirates. I think because we didn’t cut anything out it was far more interesting than the other interviews we had seen. Some of these interviews cut out parts that made the government look nefarious. It’s hilarious really how they manipulated the body cam footage of the raid to appear like they had to break into a secured compound. Later footage shows the gate the cops so dramatically climbed over didn’t have fences on either side, a few steps to the left or right and they could have simply walked in. While we’re very low tech insofar as we would have trouble programming our coffee maker to make coffee on time, we do have our finger on the pulse of what’s new in the space. We’re always considering the different technologies and how they might accent each other to make a better version of what they do. It’s pretty exciting when we’re able to lay the groundwork for two separate projects to work together. Two such cases involved Arcade City partnering with Unsung.org and Airbitz. While it remains to be seen whether or not Arcade City will be successful under Christopher David, there is no doubt that the community will, under the Arcade City name which is wildly successful. App or no app they’re not stopping, and it has been an absolute pleasure to work with the drivers who call themselves Arcade City. BC: The Crypto Show has been strong supporters of FreeRoss.org and the Ulbricht family. Can you tell our readers about this relationship?   TCS: We first met Lyn around the time the show began at the first Texas Bitcoin Conference. It seems like no-one was really paying any attention to her walking around with her FreeRoss sign, although a few people actually did bring her flowers. (Jon Rumion) for one. We already knew about the Silk Road of course but after meeting Lyn you really just can’t say no. We introduced Lyn to Luke Rudkowski which led to her doing her first video interview. Lyn was very reluctant to do a video interview because all of the mainstream press had twisted around everything she had to say to make Ross out as the “kingpin” image they were trying to create. We assured her Luke was on her side. Harlan soon began organizing the first FreeRoss fundraiser at Brave New Books. Part of that fundraiser was printing the first batch of Free Ross T-shirts. We held an event at Brave New Books and sold all sorts of things that people donated like a Liberator 3-D printed gun that someone made and Cody signed. We raised about $4000 that time. We did later hold another bigger event with more stuff to sell like a Ghost Gunner and Deep Web DVDs signed by Alex Winter. That resulted in another $6000 a lot of that stuff is actually still available on our website. TheCryptoShow.com/FreeRoss. We continue to go to events and bring the FreeRoss swag with us and sell it there.     BC: What do you guys think about the current state of Bitcoin at the moment? TCS: While we feel impatient about the block size obviously we’re not qualified to know what’s best for Bitcoin. I once had an eight-day transaction. I wasn’t overly happy about that. We once had on a guy named John with Blockstream, and he explained the virtues of this long process of deciding what to do with the block size. He said this slow pace would help prevent a fatal flaw. He said this to us before the Ethereum fork, perhaps he’s right.  BC: Can you tell our readers about your recent Dash proposal and what that entails? TCS: Danny was the first one to approach Dash and thought it was a solid team with an interesting funding model. Like all things, the hosts try to remain objective, and we do not try to involve ourselves in any territorial disputes, but we do like seeing tech work in the space and deliver what it promises. So Harlan helped write the proposal and within two months we were funded for a trial period of 3 months. What is great about the proposal is that it not only supports the show in exchange for advertising, but one-third of the budget is used to buy foodstuffs for our partnership with Unsung.org.   We felt that the Dash brand was in need of a makeover and still had a reputation from its Darkcoin days, so we offered to help by showing how a decentralized, autonomous organization, which the masternode system of Dash is, can fund a proposal that in turn gives exposure to a community that is working on solutions in both the crypto space and the real world. A win, win. So far it’s worked out great, and it’s been enjoyable having all the Dash guests on to tell us and our crypto-minded audience about the project. It’s also important to point out that the Dash protocol and governance system is more than sufficient to stand on it’s own.  BC: Can you tell us your experience with Unsung.org and Arcade City this year? TCS: As mentioned above, it’s been great. You hear all of the criticisms about Christopher David being a scammer but really look at what Arcade City the idea has become. Especially here in Austin after the Uber and Lyft fiasco, your everyday Joe Blow who was driving for Lyft or Uber started working with Arcade City and in essence became a market anarchist without even knowing it. We quickly reached out to Christopher and asked him to have the Arcade City meet ups at Brave New Books so that we could take advantage of telling the new drivers about cryptocurrency since that’s what Arcade City was supposed to be based on. Earlier in the year Jason King of Sean’s Outpost came to SXSW to display his idea of Unsung. We had him on the show, and we really loved the idea, we constantly pestered him, hey when does the Unsung app come to Austin.   After Arcade City arrived and we saw the success that was happening with the Facebook page and realized we don’t need the app to make it work. We reached out to Jason and asked him if it would be OK if we had Arcade City team up with Unsung to be the Uber end of the Unsung idea for Austin. He loved the idea, and so we went to Christopher to see if he was interested in getting the drivers involved. We didn’t even have the full sentence out of our mouth before he said yes yes yes absolutely.  So we created the Facebook group Unsung Austin #HackingHunger, and within hours there were about 100 drivers signed up who wanted to help. Today we’re still going strong on it and have a little bit of extra help with the proposal that we mentioned above at Dash.org. Only so much of the food and stuff that is donated is enough to make up these meals, the funding we get through Dash gets the extra things that are donated like water bottles, lunch sacks, napkins and energy bars stuff like that. The idea we have is that if we can perform as much as possible in these charitable ventures, we can capture the attention of the general public or just those that thought you could only buy drugs with bitcoin and crypto. BC: Do you guys listen to any other crypto-related radio broadcasts or podcasts?  TCS: Mostly podcasts from the LTB network and LRN.FM . Favorites are “Let’s Talk Bitcoin”, “Bitcoins and Gravy” and a few others. Amanda B Johnson’s Dash Detailed Youtube channel is subscribed to for the latest on Dash.   How do you guys envision the bitcoin landscape in 5-10 years?   TCS: We didn’t realize bitcoin did landscaping too 😉 But seriously, we are excited to see where all the investment takes bitcoin. We are still enthusiastic. As crisis after crisis hits markets all around the world, we feel pretty good to be talking about what bitcoin can do to save people’s assets from government incompetence and maliciousness. Money will become the most important problem to disrupt in the next 5-10 years, and bitcoin seems poised to lead us into that brave new world. Thanks guys for telling us all about the fun and good times during your radio broadcast. What do you think about The Crypto Show? What radio shows or podcasts do you listen to?

2016-12-24T13:00:06-04:00,âRemittance-Demanding Countries Dominate Bitcoin Searches in 2016,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/%e2%80%8bremittance-countries-bitcoin-searches/,"This year, remittance-demanding countries including Ghana, Malaysia and South Africa dominated search engine searches for the keyword bitcoin. Interestingly, countries that represent the highest bitcoin search engine inquiries in 2016 have either poor financial infrastructures or strict regulations on capital outflow. Users from Nigeria scored the highest on Google Trends with a 100/100 search interest. Ghana, South Africa, Malaysia and Venezuela followed, completing the list of top fiveÂ countries with highest search engine inquiries on bitcoin. Also read: Cash Usage Drops Drastically Worldwide, Bitcoin an Alternative Ghana, South Africa, Nigeria and Venezuela have poor financial infrastructure. Cross-border payments are expensive and inefficient with existing remittance systems and outlets. The general population fails to obtain necessary banking services as local financial institutions require extensive documentation on savings, properties, financial status, etc. Nigeria in particular has one of the lowest levels of financial penetration and the smallest banking sector, with just over US$118 billion in assets. EY, a multi-billion dollar research firm, stated that low account penetration in Nigeria is driven by low incomes, which currently are below US$2,000 on average. EY and other analysts also stated that Nigeria has large potential to grow in terms of finance as banks are becoming more aware of the problems originating from remittance and payments.  âNigeria has a relatively low level of domestic credit to GDP, which suggests there is considerable scope for lending growth, and consumer lending to the expanding middle class should be a major opportunity for retail banks in the market,â read a report from EY.  However, the general population is beginning to show increasing interest in alternative financial platforms and service providers. Various reports from leading analysts such as EY show that the general population has run out of patience with the countryâs inefficient banking systems. Additionally, EY stated that local banks will struggle to gain capital to fund the growth of the Nigerian financial industry. âWith such an increase in demand anticipated for corporate lending and project finance, domestic banks, especially those outside the top tier, may struggle to raise sufficient deposits to fund this growth,â the report added. The shift from conventional banking systems and financial services to mobile banking and fintech is evident in Nigeria. According to a paper entitled âEncouraging the shift to internet and mobile banking: A Nigerian perspectiveâ released by leading auditor KPMG, the countryâs 148 million mobile users are moving towards web-based transactions and mobile banking as they offer 24/7 access and enable cross-border payments. More importantly, KPMG also noted that one third of the entire Nigerian population is now below 24 years old, which has a significantly dense user base of mobile and web-based platforms. âThe problem is that Nigeriaâs banks have largely failed to translate this passion for the internet and social media into increased adoption of internet and mobile banking solutions. Just 42 percent of Nigerian banking customers said they use online banking platforms for one or more banking activities,â said Femi Oke of KPMG. âThe benefits of shifting transactions to web-based platforms are clear. For customers, web-based platforms offer convenience, 24 / 7 access, and freedom of location,â he added. As millions of users begin to shift from banks to mobile banking, an increasing number of millennials and young adults have begun to search for alternatives like bitcoin, which ultimately led to search engine inquiries. Thus, the search engine domination of bitcoin inquiries from the Nigerian population should be considered as a strong evidence for rising demand for bitcoin services. Malaysia ranked fourth in global search engine rankings for the keyword bitcoin, mostly due to Malaysians’ and expat workersâ searches for alternative remittance outlets.  Since early 2015, Malaysia has imposed heavy capital controls to prevent the devaluation of the Malaysian ringgit. This decision of the government essentially disallowed cross-border remittance payments for expat workers serving the Malaysian economy.  However, in late 2016, the Malaysian Ministry of Finance assured investors that the government will no longer impose capital controls, andÂ push for an open economy.  “As far as Malaysia is concerned, our fundamentals are solid (given) our Gross Domestic Product growth for the third quarter, economic activities and infrastructure investment. We will not go for capital controls or pegging as we are an open economy and we will remain one,” said Finance Minister Johari Abdul Ghani. With remittance payments enabled by the government, it is likely that expat workers are searching for cheaper alternatives like bitcoin, which also has high liquidity. To supplement this demand for bitcoin, prominent bitcoin service provider headquartered in the Philippines called Coins debuted in Malaysia this year. As governments continue to push for regulations on money transmission and banks fail to serve the general population, the demand for bitcoin in struggling or emerging economies will grow at a rapid pace. Do you think emerging economies will adopt bitcoin at a rapid pace in the short term? Let us know in the comments below.

Below are five bitcoin projects that promise to deliver real value to bitcoin in 2017. Also read: How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet for Your Needs Yours.org, the brainchild of Ryan X Charles, aims to decentralize content monopolies. Companies like Facebook and Youtube make money by selling advertising on content created by the public. By enabling micro payments, the Yours Network wants to be the place where content creators of all types come to monetize their own content without paying most of the potential profit to a third party. Yours is currently testing the platform with real users and hopes to open it up to the public early 2017. Also read: ‘Yours Network’ to Use Bitcoin in Competition Against Steemit Serial internet entrepreneur Kim Dotcom launched a content hosting and streaming service called MegaUpload in 2005. The site ran until 2012 when it was shut down by the US government for allegedly breaking copyright laws. Similar to how Napster’s file sharing network was a stepping stone towards today’s Pirate Bay, MegaUpload 2.0 is better, faster, stronger and says it cannot be shut down. The site introduces a new form of micro-payments called “bitcache” which uses bitcoin. Kim Dotcom stated that he has over 100 million users of the original version that will be ready to try MegaUpload 2.0 when it launches as early as January 2017 and that this will push the price of bitcoin above $2000. This platform (formerly known as Rootstock) promises to combine the functionality of ethereum smart contracts with the security of the bitcoin blockchain. Headed by Sergio Lerner and Diego Gutierrez, the team raised $1 million in funding earlier this year and launched a test net version last month. The team looks to release RSK to the public in 2017. Since RSK is using the same code as ethereum, this project could eat ethereum’s lunch and take bitcoin to the next level. Also read: RSK Launches New Testnet ‘Turmeric’ U.S. regulators have been dragging their feet on approving bitcoin funds, but around the world big players are getting involved. For example in Germany, Acatis, a fund for wealth managers and banks, now invests in bitcoin. Also, Global Advisors Bitcoin Investment Fund (GABI) based in the U.K. has recently received approval to be listed on the Channel Islands Securities Exchange. In the U.S. the Bitcoin IRA, and in Sweden XBT Provider, help investors get into bitcoin while still trading on regulated exchanges. Once products like these show some serious gains, hedge funds around the world will come under pressure to take a bitcoin position or lose customers to other funds that do. Right now a perfect storm for bitcoin is brewing around the world. Brexit, inflation in Venezuela, limits to allowable gold holdings in India, the list goes on. All these point to bitcoin as an attractive investment and a real solution for everyday use in more places around the world. The volumes traded on peer-to-peer bitcoin exchanges like Localbitcoins and Paxful are consistently reaching all-time highs.  This upward trend doesn’t look like stopping anytime soon.

2016-12-23T19:00:48-04:00,Open3D Club Utilizes Bitcoin to Create a 3D Printing DAO,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/open3d-club-bitcoin-3d-printing-dao/,"A new proof-of-concept is in the making called the open3d.club that hopes to enable connections between 3D printing artists, printers, and developers utilizing bitcoin incentives. The project aspires to be a distributed autonomous organization that promotes the 3D printing ecosystem in a decentralized manner. Also read: Smaller Pools Are Diversifying the Bitcoin Mining Industry Open3D Club is in its earliest phase of development showing the very basics of what the project aims to accomplish on its website. Currently, the platform showcases a wide variety of 3D designs that can be downloaded for free. The 3D models show a 360-degree image of each design, the artist, and the model’s dimensions. If the platform grows popular, the project aims to be “one big database of many STL 3D models.” Once a user is happy with a particular 3D printable object they can download the model or request it be printed at an independent 3D printing studio. The Open3D platform connects printing stores on a map close to the customer’s proximity. 3D printing stores can offer a deal for producing and manufacturing the finished product. Stores are paid in bitcoin, and the model’s file is transferred to the printing studio’s location. Furthermore, while the transfer processes advertisers can pay bitcoin to host an advertisement relevant to the 3D printing industry. The two revenue streams are distributed to all participating members of the Open3D printing club. Bitcoin.com chatted with the creator of the Open3D Club, Bicba, to explain to our readers what the platform is according to the organization. “It is also a suggestion for a new model of sharing and monetizing content on the Internet by encouraging collaboration of different groups of participants. Protecting privacy by not collecting any data about user activity is an essential principle we choose to follow in this model. In order to solve trust problems between parties, the whole platform is open source, and it should gradually evolve towards a protocol. 20% of all potential income is devoted to the 3D prize page, on which bounties are offered to achieve improvement in user experience and reach a protocol level. Programmers who can solve the first eight challenges will get 80% of shares (each bounty is 10%) in the software developer’s team,” explained Bicba of the Open3D Club team. In essence, the Open3D Club will use certain aspects of the platform to form a distributed autonomous organization (DAO). This includes a multi-signature wallet for bitcoin escrow, openly available source code, and a constant feedback loop of income distribution and platform usage. Open3D Club says, “every single aspect of this platform is decentralized: decision-making process, payroll, accounting, hosting, storage, etc.” Because the platform is so young, there is a team involved with the Open 3D Club platform development and the project is looking for more volunteers. In the beginning, the level of automation is quite low says the team. Reputation is a big part of the system and contributors earn reputation by work performance and participation. Currently, the team’s 3D prize page consists of eight challenges to jumpstart the web platform. Implementing one of the challenges gets a person 10% within the software developers team. Open 3D Club says, “once we solve first eight 3D prizes our original team will shrink down to 20% of developers team.” During our conversation, Bicba explains how the Open3D Club idea got started and why they chose bitcoin as an incentive for the platform’s operations. “When I made my first coffee table using CnC technology I had a realization that the same set of drawings can be stored on the Internet and used on demand indefinitely, anywhere in the world,” details the Open3D Club creator. “3D printing was just a natural extension of this idea. At first, the platform was supposed to function similarly as Wikipedia, but Bitcoin made me think that people who want to contribute can be incentivised and rewarded for their work if the platform becomes successful. I have to point out that it is practically impossible to organize the platform in this way without exclusively using cryptocurrencies.” The Open3D team understands the project has many features to build and develop. The initial steps of the project is a vision of how the club’s platform will work. Open3D Club notes that the entire platform is a “joint effort of many different groups of people having a wide range of various skills.” All of these factors of self-involvement and mutual-cooperation will come into play to evolve the Open3D Club in the future.

2016-12-23T15:00:12-04:00,Former Facebook Exec: Bitcoin Companies Will Lead Defensive Innovation,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/facebook-exec-bitcoin-defensive/,"The cyber security market is growing at a rapid pace. According to research firms like Cybersecurity Ventures and Markets and Markets, the cyber security market will be worth over US$200 billion within the next five years. Former Facebook and Coinbase Director of Security Ryan McGeehan believes bitcoin companies will lead defensive innovation and the cyber security market soon. In early November, non-profit and non-governmental human rights organization Amnesty International released a paper on privacy protection. Researchers at Amnesty analyzed and evaluated the world’s most popular social media messengers to categorize applications solely based on security measures. Also read: John McAfee: Wake the F*** up to Consumer Security Threat Amnesty International heavily criticized some of the most popular messengers including Skype, Snapchat, QQ and Google Hangouts for failing to provide end-to-end encryption. That means, upon the requests of law enforcement or other agencies, the abovementioned platforms could provide crucial user data and messages. While privacy is important to users, platform security should be at utmost importance for a company. If a platform like Skype for instance, fails to encrypt its infrastructure, data can be stolen, platform be hacked and user information can be compromised. Over the past two years, some of the largest industries including telecommunication and healthcare industries suffered from major hacking attacks and data thefts, leaving users to question the legitimacy of security protocols and encryption systems utilized by today’s leading companies. McGeehan, a security expert who collaborated with multi-billion dollar companies in the past, firmly believes that bitcoin companies will lead defensive innovation in the near future, mostly due to their expertise and experience in dealing with some of the most sophisticated and complex forms of cryptography. As McGeehan explains in his report entitled “Evidence of Absence,” there exists one major difference between bitcoin companies and other firms. That is, bitcoin companies these days have the ability to ensure users with absolute certainty that their funds haven’t been stolen. If stolen, development teams will be able to provide exact timestamps and methods utilized to steal their funds. However, companies relying on conventional security systems can’t provide details to security or hacking attempts with certainty. McGeehan states that bitcoin companies are able to provide definite responses to inquiries regarding hacking attacks and data theft because of cryptographic proof. The cryptographic systems and methods utilized by bitcoin startups provide platform operators with a unique version of the observer effect, which notifies the company immediately if an intrusion occurs. The existence of cryptographic proof could also serve bitcoin companies as a disadvantage as it publicizes any successful intrusions or data breaches. For instance, if a bitcoin wallet platform or exchange is hacked, the public would immediately be informed and the startup would most likely be condemned by the community. “This cuts two ways: We hear about every serious bitcoin breach. A bitcoin company breach is highly visible on the blockchain. Stealth intrusions do not exist when key material becomes involved. Long lasting, stealthy intrusions are common and expected at every other type of company. If content (emails, passwords, photos) had this same property, how many more breaches would we hear about?,” said McGeehan. Consider Yahoo, a popular multi-billion dollar internet company for example. The company’s data theft which occurred in 2014 came to light this past September. The company either hid the information for over two years, or didn’t know about the data breach. If the latter is the case, it becomes even a larger problem for users as it means that the company failed to detect a breach that resulted in the theft of 500 million Yahoo accounts’ information. However, because bitcoin startups still continue to use cryptographic security measures to protect user funds, substantially less hacking attacks occur in the digital currency space. The utilization of cryptographic proof allows companies to become resilient to previous hacking attacks and makes it more difficult for hackers to gain access to platforms. “We did not suffer any game ending key material breach during my time at Coinbase. I know this because there is cryptographic proof on the blockchain of that track record. Coinbase is still in business. This characteristic doesn’t measure other types of incident (phishing, malware, social engineering, etc) but a game ending breach was entirely measurable and didn’t happen,” added McGeehan. If similar cryptographic methods can implemented in conventional platforms and applications, major industries such as health care, real estate, insurance, finance and telecommunications could benefit from significantly fewer cases of security breaches.

With all eyes on bitcoin and the significant interest in blockchain solutions, this year’s conference will be a great place to be to gain insight on the future of these innovative emerging technologies.      Also read: Bitwage Expands to India Enabling BTC Wages for Workers The North American Bitcoin Conference (TNABC) is a popular event located in the sunshine state in beautiful downtown Miami. On January 17 & 18, 2017 at the James L Knight Centre many bitcoin and blockchain industry innovators, developers, and executives will gather to discuss embracing this new technology. The conference will be an educational environment with exhibitions and speakers working directly with these innovative protocols and ideas. Some of the guest speakers at TNABC include Intellisys CTO Charlie Shrem, the founder of Veritaseum Reggie Middleton, bitcoin developer Jeff Garzik, OpenBazaar’s founder Brian Hoffman, Breadwallet CEO Aaron Voisine, Valery Vavilov founder of Bitfury and many more special guests. In addition to the wide array of speakers, TNABC will also have an assortment of exhibitions including exhibits from Unsung, Genesis Mining, and the Blockchain Education Network. We chatted with TNABC organizer Moe Levin to get his insight on this event in January. Levin explains that the ultimate goal of these conferences is to draw the global community together. “Right now is a critical moment for bitcoin — it is entering a crucial phase in its development and adoption,” says Moe Levine TNABC organizer and event host. “In the last twelve months, this technology has seen a dramatic increase in visibility and experienced both the good and bad sides of the limelight: rising interest among corporations and investors, alongside more regulatory scrutiny, and uncertainty. It’s at this time, more than ever before, that the global community is needed to ensure a prosperous and well-balanced future for the technology.” Now in its 4th year, The North American Bitcoin Conference is the longest running, most well-attended bitcoin/blockchain conference in the world. Tickets are available now for two-day access, admission to the kick-off party, access to all the event’s content, and a US$50 voucher towards the next conference. Furthermore, registrants can save $50 off ticket prices by using the code VIPACCESS. TNABC is sure to be a success showcasing over 150 speakers and attendees such as industry CEOs, senior executives, investors, software programmers, and government officials. Organizers have meticulously searched for the best of the best when looking for innovators within this emerging economy. Levin explains that Miami is a great backdrop for this upcoming event saying “the changes we are seeing in the bitcoin space are making waves across the world, and those changes will undoubtedly affect the USA (and Miami) in the coming months and years.” “Miami is home to many incredible global businesses from remittances to insurance, financial investment advisories, and online trading. Many of these players will have to adapt at some point, and rather than waiting for these changes to become mandatory or be forced to change, businesses and organizations have the opportunity to be proactive and create differentiation for themselves if they commit to studying and investing in these new technologies now,” Levin added.  Will you be attending The North American Bitcoin Conference this year?

They predict the situation to worsen in 2017. Bitcoin.com asked Spencer Bogart, Equity Research analyst at Needham & Company, how Chinaâs situation could affect bitcoin. Also read: How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet for Your NeedsÂ  Goldman Sachs recently warned that the Chinese yuan is headed for its biggest annual decline in over 20 years. This decline is accompanied by China’s accelerating capital outflow, the firm said. In the first 10 months of this year, capital outflows from China rose to $530 billion, reported The Financial Times. Head of research at CEB International Investment Ltd., Banny Lam, commented: Analyst Spencer Bogart, who leads Needham & Company’s coverage of bitcoin, recently shared some thoughts on how Chinaâs situation might affect bitcoin with Bitcoin.com. âAt most, bitcoin could only account for a tiny percentageâprobably less than 1%âof capital flight from China,â Bogart explained. âRegardless of whether capital flight from China intensifies or wanes,â he pointed out that âThe real question in 2017 is whether Bitcoin will gain or lose market share as a vehicle for capital flight.â Bitcoin has been one of the ways to transfer capital out of China. Mr. Wayne Zhou, a
director at a multinational consumer goods company in Shanghai, for example, is considering buying the digital currency for this purpose, he told the Straits Times. âI feel safer having my money invested overseas,” said Zhou who started transferring money out of China several years ago. There are other more popular methods to transfer money out of China such as over-invoicing of Chinese imports, which Zhou also used. However, the Chinese authorities have reportedly clamped down on these methods. In addition to over-invoicing, Bogart mentioned overseas investments and international acquisitions by Chinese companies as more heavily used channels for capital flight than bitcoin. However, heÂ noted: In September, Bogart raised his bitcoin price projection from $655 to $848 âdue to faster-than-expected adoption and improving fundamentals.â He explained to Bitcoin.com that Needhamâs price target “is based on assumptions about bitcoinâs future market shareâ such as share of payments markets and share of gold markets. Meanwhile, amid Chinese market turmoil, bitcoinâs price has soared to its highest level since January 2014 at press time.

2016-12-21T14:00:11-04:00,Get Paid in Bitcoin to Play Android Game,Jérémie Guélat,https://news.bitcoin.com/get-paid-bitcoin-play-android-game/,"Arcade games saw a paradigm shift with the introduction of the smartphone. Many smartphone games were huge successes and became viral. Nonetheless, these games do not reward users with money. We now see another paradigm shift thanks to the invention of Bitcoin. The Android game Bitcoinbandit pays you bitcoins to play. We decided to interview Guillaume, one of the founders of this bitcoin reward-based game, right before they release a major update. Check it out. Bitcoin.com: Could you please explain to our readers what Bitcoinbandit is all about? Guillaume: Bitcoinbandit is a game of skills on mobile phones that offers to earn bitcoins. The player must propel Bandit the rabbit and its jetpack, avoid the cliff and his enemies and collect as many coins as he can. The coins collected in the tournament mode are added up and the rank of the players is defined at the end of the week. Each coin earned in the tournament represents one satoshi. Top-ranking players can earn additional cash prizes. Bitcoin.com: How is your business model different from the competition? Guillaume: Dozens of games ask us to run everywhere to catch golden coins by hundreds. But the players never get a cent out of it. Bitcoinbandit hopes to put an end to this paradox. Our team, bothered by the Pay to Win model, has created a new type of video games: get paid to play.  Also read: Bitcoin Adds Privacy To Bitcoin Betting: Interview With Nitrogen Sports Bitcoin.com: How do you generate revenues? Guillaume: The rewards offered to the players are made possible by redistributing part of our ad revenues. The more players we have, the more earnings we make and the more rewards we can give. Our goal is to distribute 1 BTC per month by 2018. Bitcoin.com: How is your company dealing with regulation and does Bitcoin make things easier or trickier?  Guillaume: Our game is totally free of charge, so far it is still legal to give money. The advantage of cryptocurrencies is obviously the low cost of transactions. We can, therefore, distribute earnings throughout the world with small transactions fees, which would not be possible with traditional currencies. We hope that this concept will be developed in other video games. Many cryptocurrencies have been created in relation to video game projects, but never with a reward given to the player. Our goal is to promote cryptocurrencies via a recreational media. We wish the players to get interested in cryptocurrencies by offering them their first wallet. Bitcoin.com: Why did you choose Bitcoin and not another cryptocurrency? Are you planning to add some other cryptocurrencies? Bitcoin.com: What plans do you have for the future (new features, growth)? Where do you see your company in 5 years? Guillaume: We are developing a new reward-based game which will continue the adventures of Bandit the rabbit, and will be available in April 2017 under the name Bitcoinbandit Pogostick. We plan to issue three games in a year. Our goal is to reach 3% of the arcade game market within five years.  What do you think about the Bitcoinbandit Android game? Ready to play?

2016-12-21T09:10:45-04:00,Bitcoin Blows Past $808 With No Sign of Heartbreak,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-blows-past-808-sign-heartbreak/,"Bitcoin’s price trend has continued its upward motion since our last analysis, steadily climbing past the US$800 range. The price value passes a milestone of the highest price average in over three years. Currently, at press time the price per BTC is $810 and charts show little resistance ahead. Also read: Vinny Lingham: If We Hit 800, We’ll Go Straight to 900 The 800s are finally here as bitcoin’s fiat value has been teasing towards this range for quite some time. Technical indicators show on both the 100 and 200 SMA that the rally may continue upwards towards the end of 2016. Buying has continued to be feverish with a daily volume of $128 million, and bitcoin’s dominance compared to so called altcoins is nearing 87 percent. Furthermore, the digital currency passed the $13 billion market capitalization mark. As the climb continues, things could shake up traders as the price rises. Trading for intra-range strategies should prove profitable along the way. However, at these price highs, anything could happen as the charts one-week stochastic patterns reveal buyers may slow down. Yet Fibonacci trend lines indicate the price may easily blow past the $900 range. Bitcoin has had lots of positive headlines over the past two weeks. Even mainstream media has been reporting bitcoin’s phenomenal performance this past year. Reuters details bitcoin’s value has been its highest in three years. Meanwhile, the publication Bloomberg writes the digital asset was one of the top performing currencies worldwide and even topped gold. The cryptocurrency has been getting lots of attention due to its bullish price trend. Also read: Venezuela Prints Bills, Closes Borders – Bitcoin to the Rescue Furthermore, headlines report certain countries across the globe have been suffering from economic turmoil and some experiencing a cash crisis. Countries like India and Venezuela have reportedly been gravitating towards bitcoin’s benefits. Alongside this, people speculate the devaluation of the Chinese yuan and tighter capital controls in the region is also causing flight towards bitcoin. Many regions worldwide are seeing significant Localbitcoins volume spikes such as Russia, the U.S., and India. Bitcoin has hit some slight resistance in the $810-820 range, but this may not last long. If there’s some correction coming soon, there is a strong floor at the $780 mark. The price may continue towards the $900 level but year-end selling could happen soon and breach upwards trend patterns. Traditionally selling increases during the holiday months to pay for expenses. Bear Scenario: At press time support looks solid at $780 with nothing significant showing it could go lower than that anytime soon. However, at these price highs, there could be some bear traps along the way that shake out weak hands. The stochastic indicator details the price per BTC may be overbought. Bull Scenario: The price per BTC has consolidated slightly above the $800 range. Buying volume has increased quite a bit, and there may be some higher price vantage points ending the year. One-week charts suggest the bullish rally is still steaming forward and the ship will continue sailing! However always note the seas can always get rough along the way.

But how is the Bitcoin scene faring in this small Scandinavian country rich in natural resources and warm at heart?  Also read: ‘Monetary Xenophobia’: Norway’s Biggest Bank Pulls Bitcoin Account  This August I had the privilege of meeting Therese Helland, a Bitcoin and blockchain consultant based in Oslo, Norway. I’ve traveled to Norway several times to visit family and have been curious about the Bitcoin ecosystem there. Therese recently was elected to the board of the Norway Bitcoin Association. She is currently creating a coworking space near her cafe the Kasbah in Oslo for a place for innovators to meet, work and discuss decentralization, blockchain technology, and cryptocurrencies.  Therese and the Norwegian Bitcoin Foundation hosted an event this past weekend in the a coworking space. They helped individuals download Bitcoin wallets and helped them pay for coffee and treats with Bitcoin at Therese’s Bitcoin-accepting cafe. As the year is coming to close, I asked Therese her view of the Norwegian Bitcoin ecosystem and the Norwegian Bitcoin Foundation’s plans for 2017 and beyond.  Elizabeth McCauley: Can you share when and how you first learned about Bitcoin? Therese Helland: Having a background in IT, Bitcoin was something that had been lingering in the back of my mind for years without me paying too much attention. When I finished an IT consulting contract at the beginning of this year, I took some time off and was on the lookout for something meaningful to be my next endeavor. By coincidence, I was introduced to blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies. I went to a conference and was sold immediately. Since then I have been engaging in all sorts of initiatives within this exciting area of new technology.  EM: What is the easiest way to buy and sell Bitcoin in Norway? How many exchanges and brokerages services are there? TH: There is Bitmynt and LocalBitcoins. Also, some people are using international exchanges such as Kraken, Poloniex, Coinbase, Bittrex, etc. EM: Are there any merchants and businesses accepting Bitcoin in Norway? TH: Not many. The Norwegian Bitcoin Foundation is maintaining a list and adding new merchants as they are made aware of them. Apart from that, global trade gives more possibilities for Norwegians to use Bitcoin. EM: How is Bitcoin currently used in Norway? For an investment and trading or for everyday use? TH: Mostly investment/trading by a select few as far as I know. Generally, Norway is a little slow in the adoption, and as in many other places, there is a largely untapped market within remittance. EM: Can you share more about the Norway Bitcoin Association? How was it founded? What is the makeup of the organization TH: The Norwegian Bitcoin Foundation (Norges Bitcoinforening) is a non-profit organisation founded in July 2016. More or less, the organisation is for everyone who is interested in Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrencies and techniques. It´s functions are to spread knowledge and interest in Bitcoin and similar cryptocurrency techniques in society. EM: We heard in October news of bank account closures for Bitcoin-related businesses in Norway. Can you comment on this and if anything has changed? Can Bitcoin exchanges in Norway obtain a Norwegian Bank Account? TH: As far as I know, there are no formal rules prohibiting Norwegian banks to offer bank accounts to Bitcoin exchanges. However, if you are referring to one of the largest banks, DnB, closing the account of the Norwegian Bitcoin Foundation, it is true that they did on the basis that they could not be sure that the association’s money (a total deposit of about $100 at the time) has no connection with money laundering or terror activities. More information about the course of events can be found in this article (in Norwegian, but Google translate is quite good). EM: Can you comment on the government’s current view of Bitcoin in Norway? TH: The government’s knowledge on Bitcoin appears to still be relatively limited, and they haven´t yet issued a specific official view of Bitcoin. EM: What do you see needs to be done to make Bitcoin more mainstream in Norway? TH: The main obstacle is that there is a 25% VAT being charged for exchanging between NOK and BTC, and this must be removed. Furthermore, I believe it is important to increase the knowledge amongst the general public, as well as the other tasks the Norwegian Bitcoin Foundation has set out to undertake.  Educating the general public and raising their awareness of decentralized technologies and legal, philosophical and economical alternatives to how we currently live is also an important task, and what we are aiming to house in our new coworking and community center.  EM: Are larger financial institutions in Norway looking into Blockchain applications? TH: Most of them are looking into it, but no one has any known concrete products to this date as far as I know. EM: What do you think is the killer use case for Bitcoin? TH: There are numerous obvious and often talked about use cases such as remittance, banking for the unbanked, etc. For me, however, the most exciting thing about Bitcoin and Blockchain Technology is the potential it has to change our way of life, for example by getting rid of unnecessary third parties in transactions between humans.  I think we are still at very early stages and that the most exciting use cases are yet to be discovered and explored, but I also believe we are at a breaking point right now and that a lot will happen in 2017 and beyond. All-in-all very exciting times, and I look forward to following the development in the months and years to come.  Norway is ranked the second “richest” country in Europe and is just starting to catch the Bitcoin bug. It will be interesting to see what transpires over the next few months with the Norwegian Bitcoin Foundation and the new projects underway to spread education and awareness in this small but prosperous country.  What do you think about Bitcoin’s progress in Norway? Which European country do you think will take the lead in Bitcoin adoption? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below.

2016-12-20T19:00:10-04:00,"Cash Usage Drops Drastically Worldwide, Bitcoin an Alternative",Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/cash-usage-drop-drastically-bitcoin/,"The global war on cash, initiated by some of the leading economies and governments across the world, is starting to impact financial ecosystems. According to various sources, cash usage in countries including the US, South Korea and Denmark has decreased drastically and is presumed to decline even more in the foreseeable future. As cash continues to devalue, bitcoin is becoming a strong alternative to government-issued money. Also read: US Slowly Going Cash-Free, But Where’s the Bitcoin? The central bank of Denmark, also known as Danmarks Nationalbank, has long considered substituting cash with a blockchain-based currency called E-krone. Using its national currency the Danish krone as basis, the Nationalbank is considering replacing cash with an electronic form of money. Lars Rohde, the governor of the Danish central bank who oversaw the bank’s cash printing press for years, stated in an interview that cash usage in Denmark already dipped below 20%, He also noted that the rest of the Danish population rely on online banking systems or alternative financial service providers to settle payments and transfer assets. Thus, following the global trend of cash suppression, Rohde is moving forward with the concept of e-krone in 2017. However, like any centralized digital currencies or assets, e-krone does not make an efficient form of money as it fails to be decentralized. The e-krone providers the Danish central bank with a high level of control, which ultimately would lead to the compromisation of security and privacy. If Denmark continues to pursue the path of restricting cash and development of digital payment networks, it is likely that bitcoin would emerge as a strong alternative. As Rohde stated, if a digital payment network takes over, cash will no longer the economy as an alternative. It will be substituted and replaced for good. “Cash and notes are not an alternative to electronic payments. We went beyond that many years ago,” said Rohde. The U.S., which houses some of the largest fintech and bitcoin firms in the world, is also seeing a drastic change in payments and financial settlement. Recently, prominent law firm Paul Hastings released a research paper which stated that non-cash payments in the U.S. and U.K. will reach US$46 trillion and $1.75 trillion respectively by 2026. That means, within the next decade, cash transactions will only account for 24% of all payments in the U.S., with 76% of all transactions being handled with non-cash payment networks and methods. The analysis of Paul Hastings is based on reliable market data and financial trends, which was conducted in association with the Centre for Economics & Business Research and YouGov. Optimistically, the growth of the global fintech industry and startups are on par with the declining usage of cash, offering the general population more options to select from apart from banks and traditional financial service providers. However, Accenture, a multi-billion dollar research firm, recently noted in an article entitled “Global Fintech Investment Growth Continues in 2016 Driven by Europe and Asia” that the U.S. is falling behind Asia and Europe in terms of fintech investment and startup growth, which can be accounted to the government’s inability to present practical regulatory frameworks.  South Korean mainstream media and leading research firms including Chosun, the largest media network in the country, have conducted various research initiatives to exploit the potential and practicality of a cashless society. Interestingly, instead of seeking for alternatives like e-money or blockchain-based systems, Chosun and the South Korean mainstream media are optimistic towards bitcoin, which already has established a market cap larger than that of many national currencies. In fact, several analysts and reputable experts led research on bitcoin and the possibility of using bitcoin as an alternative to cash. South Korea already announced its finalized plans to demonetize coins by the end of 2020. Instead of receiving coins, users would have to enter credit card details to have coins sent to their bank accounts. Bitcoin could make this process easier, more secure and efficient for the general population. As global cash usage declines, the need for a digital form of payment or store of value such as bitcoin is becoming more obvious. Bitcoin has proved to be the safest and the most secure form of digital store of value since its introduction in 2009 and an increasing number of institutions, individuals and investors are seeing it as the global currency.

2016-12-20T12:00:34-04:00,How to Choose the Right Bitcoin Wallet for Your Needs,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/choose-right-bitcoin-wallet-needs/,"Knowing how to best safeguard your bitcoins can be tricky since many different solutions exist for various needs such as privacy, simplicity, and long term storage. Also read: Ledger Nano S Review: Why I Threw Out My Paper Wallet Choosing a bitcoin wallet is no longer a simple matter of settling between security and simplicity. Using a few wallets for different purposes is becoming the standard, much like using different types of accounts for fiat money. The ultimate in convenience is found at ‘bitcoin banks’ like Coinbase and Xapo, which hold onto your coins and private keys. They offer the fastest access to buy, sell, and spend your bitcoins. However, since you do not control your private keys, they are best treated as on-ramps and off-ramps to owning bitcoin only and should not be considered long term storage of your coins for any serious amount. Mobile or web-based wallets are easily set up and have many unique features making them attractive to new bitcoin users. Blockchain wallet is the world’s most popular bitcoin wallet with over 10 million installs, largely because of its super-simple and private interface. Airbitz and old-school favorite Mycelium wallets allow buying bitcoins from inside the app. Airbitz also offers vendor discounts and has built-in mobile top-up. There are many others such as Breadwallet, Copay, Jaxx, and Greenaddress; all have something unique to offer. However, these wallets are considered lower security, ‘pocket money’ wallets even though some now offer two-factor identification and other security measures making them pretty secure. Most experts still advise to only keep an amount of bitcoin on them that we can afford to lose, such as $100 or less, since they are not kept offline and could be subject to hacking. For those who make privacy their highest concern, a few wallets were made to add extra anonymity layers to accessing stored bitcoins. For example, some support the anonymity network TOR, while others offer coin-mixing schemes like Coinjoin. Darkwallet was the infamous first attempt, but development on it has stopped and it is not considered safe. Samourai wallet is fun and full-featured. The most popular option for dark web users, however, has been the highly-configurable wallet Electrum, which offers a few privacy options while allowing for offline storage. Those active in the bitcoin technical community who do mining or run a node to support the network may want to run one of a few “full wallets.” These wallets download a whole copy of the blockchain and act as a peer-to-peer node for the support of the community. A few different versions exist such as Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Unlimited. Each one represents a different view of how the bitcoin protocol should behave. Hardware wallets like the Trezor, Keepkey, and the Ledger Nano S, offer convenient access to highly secured bitcoins kept fully offline. Although they can cost between $60 and $100, these devices allow bitcoins to be spent directly from where no hackers can get to them; a task that is too technical for most users to duplicate in non-hardware wallets. The security features make hardware wallets ideal to receive bitcoin income in. Once in a hardware wallet, any amount of bitcoins can be transferred over to other types of wallets for extra functionalities while keeping the remaining offline by default. For those with large amounts of bitcoin, a few wallets have added exceptional levels of security, at the cost of extra complexity and learning. The first such wallet made, Armory, is no longer fully supported but still available. This flexible wallet offers several unique options but requires downloading the whole blockchain. Using the privacy wallet Electrum on a Tails USB boot drive is one of the most popular ways to bypass malware and hackers. It’s so popular that the Tails build has even included the Electrum wallet as its default bitcoin wallet. For maximum security, follow all directions completely and then only use the Tails drive sparingly, using the whole operating system only for your wallet. For long term storage, many have chosen to greatly reduce the access to their coins by keeping them on printed paper only, a form called ‘paper wallets’. Making one requires a small amount of trust in the website or code that randomly generates the wallet, although with technical proficiency, that trust can be reduced. Bitaddress was the first popular paper wallet generator, but there are several others, including Bitcoin.com’s. For added randomness, technophiles can use physical dice can be used to generate perfectly-secure bitcoin address or seed using Diceware. Keep in mind that bitcoins stored on paper will have to be swept into a different wallet where it can be spent from, making this option only suitable for long-term storage. In addition, the chance of fire over several years should not be overlooked, so paper wallets must be stored in a fireproof safe that you control. Never store them nor any wallet seed in a safety deposit box at a bank. Which bitcoin wallets are right for you? Let us know in the comments section below.

2016-12-20T06:00:49-04:00,Smaller Pools Are Diversifying the Bitcoin Mining Industry,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/pools-diversifying-bitcoin-mining/,"Bitcoin mining has become an advanced competitive market alongside securing the network. Over the years the mining sector has changed significantly from home operations, mining pools, and large data facilities churning out blocks. While observing mining pools over the years, there’s been a few times where skeptics have believed mining was quite centralized. However, more recently mining pool distribution has divided significantly with the mining industry taking new form once again. Also read: Why Jim Harper Is Dead Wrong on Bitcoin The mining economy has come a long way since the inception of bitcoin. When the cryptocurrency began bitcoin supporters could mine utilizing their central processing unit (CPU) and graphics processing unit (GPU). When GPU mining became popular, individuals began creating mining farms and the network’s hashrate distribution started its first phase. Around 2010 people became more aware of how powerful mining farms had become, with people like Artforz claiming 20-30% of the network hashrate.  During the fall of 2010, the mining community was growing significantly, and the formation of groups mining together took place. One of the first mining pools was Slush’s Pool and following other pools such as Ghash.io and BTCguild emerged. As bitcoin became more popular and its value increased, the creation of large data mining facilities in countries like China and Iceland appeared. These groups claimed significant amounts of the network’s hashrate, and some observers became skeptical of mining centralization. Hashrate Distribution over the past two years has seen a large concentration of Chinese mining companies. According to the New York Times’ Nathaniel Popper, at one point 70 percent of bitcoin transactions were processed by four Chinese mining pools. Speculators have attributed this to the region’s low electrical costs, and mining equipment is manufactured in great number there. Additionally, Bitmain founder Jihan Wu explained to the New York Times that China expects its regional companies to be on the forefront of technology.  Recently mining distribution has changed quite a bit with many smaller pools taking a piece of the hashrate pie. At present hashrate distribution among pools has become more diverse than ever. Mining pools such as Bitcoin India, 1Hash, Gogreenlight, and many others have captured small percentages of the network’s computing power. Five large pools process roughly 63 percent of the network and 19 smaller groups encompass the rest. This is a notable change since last year where many of the pools were more concentrated. There are multiple reasons the mining industry is going through changes. The price per bitcoin has risen exponentially with its highest consecutive value in over three years. This is attributed to mining continuing to be profitable even after the reward halving. Because the value has increased, many other players have been able to enter the mining community. Moreover mining operations are becoming more visible in countries like the U.S., and India. Other larger pools have dispersed into smaller groups and some operations like KNC Miners have been liquidated. The mining community and industry will likely continue to change over time. Right now the hashrate distribution seems to be dividing up into smaller factions, and this may continue to develop. Chinese pool operations are still commanding a large portion of the network’s computing power. However, smaller factions of Chinese pools like HaoBTC have diversified the distribution amongst the larger operations. As technology advances in application-specific integrated circuits (ASIC) the mining community is sure to continue to change. This past July at the D10E event in San Francisco bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos told attendees ASIC 14nm chip improvements are great for decentralization. “It’s a very good thing for decentralization,” explained Antonopoulos. “What it does is it extends the shelf life of mining equipment from 2-3 months of usable life cycle to almost two years, which levels the playing field among all participants in the system.”    Alongside mining equipment improvements the digital assets’ price value and reward halvings will always shift the mining industry constantly. There will always be many variations to bitcoin’s hashrate distribution, with many cryptocurrency proponents hoping it remains decentralized.

The company already operates one machine in Ho Chi Minh City, the country’s largest city. At the same time, it announced a partnership with local exchange Bitcoin Vietnam to supply all four machines. Also read: How to Get Your Friends Onto the Bitcoin Bandwagon EasyBit already operates over 60 bitcoin ATMs in over 10 countries. The four Vietnam machines, all supplied by Canadian hardware manufacturer BitAccess, will be two-way. This means users can deposit bitcoins for cash as well as buy digital currency. Bitcoin Vietnam will handle all operations on the ground, such as liquidity management, marketing, customer service and legal issues. The operators expect a percentage of business to come from Vietnam’s $13 billion USD remittance industry. The country currently ranks #11 in the world for money sent home from overseas workers and relatives. However the company has observed many other use-cases, such as students purchasing online games with bitcoin, people purchasing goods from China and the U.S., and miners cashing out their proceeds. A representative said: “The BTMs so far are mostly used in our experience especially from new users who don’t necessarily have the trust yet in the online exchange websites, or tourists (who are already exposed to Bitcoin) visiting town who look for an easy way to cash out some of their crypto-holding to the local currency”. Bitcoin Vietnam CEO Nguyen Tran Bao Phuong said she was looking forward to working with experienced partners to bring the benefits of this new technology to the Vietnamese market. Bitcoin Vietnam, which began serving customers in 2014, has remittances and the financially underserved in its sights. Last year it launched VBTC, which exchanges bitcoin and sends money transfers even to those without bank accounts. According to the World Bank, as much as 70% of Vietnam’s population is “unbanked”. The partnership’s first Bitcoin ATM is already installed and operating. It is available from 10AM to 1AM, seven days a week at Italiani’s home made pizza restaurant in Ho Chi Minh City. Three more machines are headed to Vietnam for as-yet-unannounced locations, likely to also be gathering spots for the young and more tech-savvy crowd. Vietnamese law requires every phone number to link to a specific personal identity. For that reason, the machines will require only a phone number to verify transactions at this point. However the hardware also allows for additional verification (ID scan and face camera) if necessary. Cash withdrawals will be limited to less-than-four-figure USD equivalents. This limit makes the machines more suitable to consumers rather than large-scale operations, and avoids situations where machines regularly run out of cash. Do you use bitcoin ATMs? Where would you like to see more of them? Let us know in the comments.  Images via Shutterstock, Italiani’s Pizza Now you’ve got your first bitcoin, where can you spend it? Well, the easiest place to try it out is our very own bitcoin.com Store. You’ll find everything bitcoin-related, from clothing to all kinds of accessories and much more. You’ll experience that “wow” moment all bitcoiners have felt after paying with bitcoin for the first time. "

2016-12-19T12:00:38-04:00,Bitcoin Outperformed All Currencies in 2016,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-outperformed-currencies-2016/,"Bitcoin outperformed all currencies on 2016, increasing from US$433 at the beginning of the year to $794 year-to-date. Recording an annual gain of 54%, the price of bitcoin is expected to pass $800 shortly. While bitcoin solidified a strong performance this year, the majority of leading reserve currencies including the USD, CNY, JPY and GBP stumbled. Most currencies in the top 10 including the Chinese yuan, British pound and Indian rupee ended up recording significant annual losses, with the Chinese yuan demonstrating drastic devaluation, the GBP reaching one of its all-time lows and the Indian rupee falling behind as well. Also read: Best Selling Financial Author: Bitcoin Is the New Safe Haven Asset Coincidentally, most of the reserve currencies above mentioned that failed to meet the expectations of investors, businesses and traders are still currently undergoing severe economic and financial instability. The Chinese yuan, which showed an annual loss of 6%, declined substantially despite the government’s desperate attempt to prevent devaluation. Experts predict that as the Chinese New Year approaches, a larger amount of cash outflow will be requested and the Chinese yuan will decrease in value even more. The British pound also had one of its worst years in recent history after its decision to exit from the European Union. The value of the British pound plunged almost immediately after the announcement was announced, leaving the economy in panic and chaos. Amid this global economic turmoil, bitcoin recorded a 54% increase in value mostly due to increasing realization of bitcoin as a store of value and the general population’s development of awareness towards the devaluation of cash and excessive financial control of the government. For instance, when the Chinese government announced a major plan to crackdown on wealth management products (WMPs), which amounted to over $3.9 trillion, the demand for bitcoin surged, pushing the price of bitcoin to 5,000 CNY in the Chinese bitcoin exchange market. Investors and traders were buying bitcoin at a 10% premium to ensure that their wealth is not affected by tightening regulations imposed by the local authorities. Also, as previously covered by Bitcoin.com, best-selling financial author Holger Zschaebitz discovered a correlation with assets like gold and bitcoin. Zschaebitz noted that whenever precious metals like gold declines in value, the price of bitcoin rises, implying that investors and traders are beginning to see bitcoin as the global safe haven asset instead of gold. Two of the major factors that allowed the mainstream population to acknowledge the benefits and advantages of bitcoin over traditional forms of money is bitcoin’s transportability and decentralized nature. The fact that bitcoin can be sent anywhere to anyone in the world without the presence of a third party or regulation of the government played a vital role in the increasing value of bitcoin. These two features of bitcoin-enabled individuals in chaotic economies such as Venezuela and India pushed the general population to depend on bitcoin to avoid a crackdown on cash and government’s confiscation of physical assets such as gold. Bitcoin also outperformed currencies within the cryptography space, easily surpassing the growth rate and market cap of 118 altcoins. Bitcoin’s unprecedented price development and growth are evident in a chart introduced by Willy Woo, a cryptocurrency enthusiast, and operator of Woobull.com.  Various experts including August Capital partner and former Salesforce executive Villi Iltchev predicted bitcoin to cross the $800 mark before the end of the year as there exists many currencies and assets that are trustworthy. Bobby Lee, CEO of BTCC also noted that bitcoin is set to pass $800 shortly. Do you think bitcoin will pass $800 before the end of the year? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-19T06:00:33-04:00,IRS Attack Dog Will Target US Bitcoiners and Soon…,Wendy McElroy,https://news.bitcoin.com/irs-attack-dog-target-us-bitcoiners/,"Recent news about the IRS and bitcoin is disturbing enough, but it is the tip of an iceberg known as FATCA. American bitcoiners should be aware that their transactions of the past few years could endanger them. Also read: IRS Demands Coinbase Records In Surprise Tax Probe The visible news: On November 18, a headline at Coindesk announced, “The IRS is Seeking Data on Coinbase’s Bitcoin Customers.” The article stated, “it seems, the IRS is looking to more aggressively police digital currency users in the US, and the [tax] investigation itself focuses on taxpayers who transacted between 2013 and 2015.” The investigation rests on a “John Doe” warrant. The “John Does” of interest are Americans who use bitcoin to evade tax reporting and payment requirements. The goal is almost certainly to audit non-compliers. Unfortunately, since the focus is on past transactions, a proactive response is difficult. Currently, the matter is on hold. A Coinbase customer has filed suit to block IRS access to records, but the suit is unlikely to prevail; the IRS wins 90% of such cases. Coinbase is also resisting the IRS, but it will almost certainly comply under a court order. The brake on the IRS is not likely to last. Meanwhile, a key aspect of the IRS demand is under-discussed. The agency clearly wants to extend the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) to cover bitcoiners. The iceberg: FATCA is the enforcement mechanism for a tax policy called Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts (FBAR). FBAR spells out the compliance requirements of “United States persons” who have foreign accounts that amount to $10,000 or more at any point in one year. Those accounts and other assets are considered taxable by the IRS even if the “United States person” lives and earns abroad. FBAR has been less than effective in collecting taxes, however, because the IRS must rely on voluntary reporting, snitches or luck. Enter FATCA. Passed in March 2010, FATCA imposes extensive requirements on foreign banks and financial institutions to report on the accounts and transactions of American clients. It does not target individuals but institutions. Or, rather, it targets individuals by strong-arming institutions to provide open access to their accounts. A sense of how aggressive FATCA is can be gleaned from its sweeping definitions. For example, the definition of an American with tax liability includes ‘accidental Americans.’ These are people who might have never set foot on U.S. soil but have at least one American parent and so are considered dual citizens. Thus, Canadian-born Ted Cruz could run for President because his mother was American. An estimated 1 in 20 Canadians are either American transplants or accidental Americans. Those classified as American by FATCA are legally required to file returns and pay whatever taxes the IRS proscribes for foreign assets; it doesn’t matter if taxes are being paid to the foreign government as well. The definition of a foreign financial institution is equally broad. The standard one is “[a]ny foreign entity that: Accepts deposits in the ordinary course of banking or a similar business such as banks and credit unions. Holds financial assets for the account of others as a substantial portion of its business such as brokerages or custodians.” It currently includes security brokerages and could easily be expanded to include bitcoin institutions such as exchanges. It is technically true that the U.S. cannot compel foreign institutions to obey IRS regulations. But powerful ‘incentives’ are in place. For example, the U.S. threatens to withhold up to 30% of any U.S. security transaction from a noncomplying bank. In Forbes (October 19), tax attorney Robert W. Wood explained: FATCA almost certainly wants to plunder the untapped wealth of the bitcoins owned or traded by “United States persons.” The first ones targeted will be natural-born Americans, who are low-hanging fruit; those who are more difficult to track, such as accidental Americans, are likely to be next. And the first step in uncovering all of them is to demand compliance from the financial institutions of cryptocurrency, such as Coinbase. Several compelling indications exist. Two are particularly significant. First, in March of 2014, the IRS issued a notice stating that digital currencies were to be taxed as property. This has sweeping implications which were spelled out in a 16-part FAQ. For example, wages paid in bitcoin are subject to income tax; goods and services are part of reportable gross income; losses and gains in bitcoin value are capital gains in many instances. These policies have had little impact on the digital community because the IRS lacked an enforcement mechanism. A FATCA that targets the financial institutions could become an effective enforcement mechanism – that is, if the institutions comply. Again, the enforcement will undoubtedly start in the United States. But, given the agility with which digital currencies can flee across borders, the IRS is likely to swiftly go after foreign exchanges in the same manner as it went after banks. A November 13, 2014, Bloomberg article, entitled “Bitcoin Accounts May Be Subject to FBAR, FATCA Reporting,” stated, The “eventually” seems to be arriving. Indeed, the process has been unfolding for over a year now. Bitstamp, which has offices in the UK and Luxembourg as well as America, states in its Terms of Use: In the big picture, the IRS’s attempt may be unsuccessful because of the unique nature of cryptocurrencies. In the smaller picture, however, the brute force of its attack could devastate many individuals. Second, on November 18, 2016, a court document “had detailed testimony in support of issuing the summons” against Coinbase. Daniel Winters, a specialist in cryptocurrency taxation, recently pointed to a rather ominous aspect of that document. Winters also pointed to the IRS agent’s past involvement in auditing a taxpayer and two corporations who used offshore “arrangements” to avoid taxes. Winters commented, “[t]he IRS audit did not go well for the taxpayers.” Americans or “United States persons” who have used financial institutions, such as exchanges, for their bitcoins should be aware that the past few years worth of transactions are vulnerable to IRS scrutiny. Winters advised, “You may not be informed if your records are sent to the IRS, and may find out only when you receive a nasty letter from the IRS demanding payment of the tax due on the bitcoin income.” If there is a solution to this situation, bitcoiners had best forge it now.

2016-12-18T19:00:01-04:00,How to Get Your Friends Onto the Bitcoin Bandwagon,Mike White,https://news.bitcoin.com/get-friends-onto-bitcoin-bandwagon/,"Most of us who have ever listened to a bitcoin talk delivered by Andreas Antonopolous come away with renewed clarity as to the “obviousness” of bitcoin being the best thing since… ever.  Why then is it so hard for us to get our friends to become even mildly as enthusiastic as we are? This short article aims to cover the five topics to master when bringing people into the bitcoin / crypto revolution. You might think that dropping jargon like “decentralisation”, “block rewards”, “satoshis” and “the Federal Reserve” in your first few sentences when describing bitcoin sounds awesome but your mate doesn’t. Once it’s over their head, you have lost them. And you might not realize where you lost them because they won’t tell you. When making a point and introducing new words… keep it simple!  Phrases like “Does that make sense?”, Do you agree? Are you with me?” cannot be used often enough. Make sure your audience is with you every step of the way. When you get stuck on a topic great! This is where the real learning takes place. Also read: India Encourages ‘Mission Mode’ Digital Currency Adoption Most of us didn’t “get it” the first time we heard about bitcoin. Learning this stuff is difficult not only because of new words and technology but also because this subject challenges beliefs people have had all their lives. I know it’s exciting and you want to tell everyone everything but focus on little chunks and find out what areas peak you friends curiosity and focus on that. In a way, us earlier adopters had it much easier because back then most of the information out there on the net was actually useful. Now a newbie has to sort through the ocean of rubbish, click bait and scams online to hopefully get correct information. Help them navigate this minefield by giving them people to follow on youtube like Andreas. Also read: Andreas Antonopoulos: AMA With the 8BTC Community Give your mates time to absorb the information and encourage them to continue the discussion with you later. It is easy for us bitcoin believers to get a bit over enthusiastic when sharing our wisdom and try to push the issue when others don’t seem to grasp the concept. If you can tell a discussion is going nowhere know when to back off. Not everyone wants to discover the best thing ever right now and sometimes repetition is not key. It is easy for Bill Gates or Warren Buffet to command attention when they are talking about money, but odds are you don’t have the reputation they do. Before being persuasive in anything you need to understand how you are perceived by your audience. Do people come to you for worldly advice? Are you the guy who always has a crazy idea?  Understanding how you are seen before during and after your chat will help you design your approach. Some people just won’t see you as an authority on this subject. That is fine. The important thing to realize here is that maybe they want a conversation and you may have turned it into a lesson. Just let it be known that you are into this stuff and eventually, if you are open and agreeable, a lot of these people will start approaching you.   Us bitcoiners have all the answers. We have heard every argument against bitcoin 100 times before, and we waste no time correcting our mistaken comrades.  — “Yes the FED is a massive scam.”  — “No, the government can’t just shut bitcoin it down.”  — “No, bitcoin has never been hacked.”  Even though we feel that we are doing a fantastic thing by showing our mates the reality of the world, more often than not the other person feels like we are attacking their views.  A wise quote is “He who is convinced against his will is of the same opinion still.”  Coming at people’s’ beliefs like a bull at a gate is not the best approach. So what is? Start by finding common ground instead of going head to head. Whether your audience is left wing or right wing, interested in business, charity, history or the arts, there are limitless bitcoin and blockchain examples you can use to show how a situation they care about can be improved. Also read: Scientific Research Proof-of-Concept Validates Bitcoin Technology Once they see clearly how this new technology can improve something they care about, they will naturally start to see how it can apply to basically everything else. All the philosophizing, videos and preaching in the world will have little effect compared to getting your friend to EXPERIENCE bitcoin. Once your buddy has shown any interest at all, do the following… • Help them download a wallet and send them bitcoin!
• Get them to send it back. Explain that you just sent money to them like an email and help them understand that you can send it anywhere in the world 24/7 and that it can be 2 cents or 20 million dollars.

2016-12-18T06:00:25-04:00,Bitcoin Gains 1.1 Million+ New Wallets Every Quarter,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-millions-new-wallets/,"Bitcoin outperformed every other reserve currency in 2016 by large margins. An increasing number of investors, traders and businesses have begun to recognize bitcoin as the world’s global currency, depending on bitcoin to protect their wealth from tightening regulations and the government’s excessive control over money. This surge in demand for bitcoin led to its increased global acceptance, with 1.1 million new wallets being created every quarter. 2016 so far has been the year of capital controls, war on cash, restriction of assets and decline of gold, which most investors and traders believed to be the global safe haven asset for decades. Amongst rapidly devaluing currencies and assets, bitcoin continuously demonstrated a strong performance in terms of adoption and market value, recording a consistent growth of over 1.1 million new wallets each three months since earlier this year. Also read: Why Jim Harper Is Dead Wrong on Bitcoin Bloomberg recently revealed that bitcoin has seen a consistent growth in user base over the past two years. In 2016, the total number of bitcoin wallets on blockchain.info alone grew from 5.3 million to 11 million, adding 5.7 million new bitcoin wallets since January of this year. Apart from blockchain.info, the most popular bitcoin wallet service provider today, other popular bitcoin wallet platforms have also reached significant milestones, with Coinbase reaching 5 million users in year-to-date. The rapid increase in global awareness and adoption of bitcoin can be directly attributable to the market instability and economic struggle of most countries including India, China and the US amongst others. Particularly, two of the largest gold importers India and China have begun to ban gold importation and seize the precious metal at borders and airports — while some countries have imposed serious capital controls to crackdown on criminal usage of cash and outflow of money. As a result, Genesis Mining co-founder and CFO Marco Krohn told Bloomberg that he firmly believes the price of bitcoin will increase by 100% next year, as the user base of the digital currency continues to grow and the demand for bitcoin remains high in regions with heavy capital controls. “My personal expectation is that bitcoin will at least gain another 100 percent,” said Krohn. Security and bitcoin expert Andreas Antonopoulos also criticized the idea of governments solidifying their stance on restricting cash, describing cashless society as totalitarian society. If more individuals, investors, businesses and traders continue to develop awareness towards excessive control of government on cash and assets, the demand for decentralized currencies like bitcoin will rise even further, expanding the global user base. CNBC and many other mainstream media outlets criticized the slow growth of bitcoin’s userbase in 2015, stating that bitcoin would only have 5 million active users by 2019. Some consultants and analysts including Windsor Holden noted that bitcoin will not be able to hold up with the competition within the financial industry. To my mind there are far more pressing needs for the retailers, there are so many other payment options emerging,” said Holden, head of forecasting and consultancy at Juniper. More importantly, the study released by Juniper called “The Future of Blockchain”, which received mainstream media coverage, failed to predict the growth of bitcoin essentially by concluding that bitcoin would remain as a niche marketplace. Holden, like other analysts, emphasized that payment networks from tech giants like Apple and Samsung would ultimately surpass the growth of bitcoin by appealing to the general population. However, similar to most mainstream media predictions and analysis from research firms, this has proven to be false. Bitcoin has seen the registration of over 6 million new wallets in 2016 alone and as market instability worsens in 2017, bitcoin could well experience an explosive growth.

2016-12-17T19:00:11-04:00,How Altcoins Complement Bitcoin,Kei K,https://news.bitcoin.com/how-altcoins-complement-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin is the only proven viable cryptocurrency with a huge infrastructure, market capitalization and established network effects. However the 700 altcoins that exist today also have a purpose — and may even complement bitcoin.  (Also See: Bitwala: ‘Nobody Uses Altcoins,’ Bitcoin Is the Top Crypto) Bitcoin has evolved from a ‘joke’ to changing the trajectory of systems in the world of finance. Bitcoin’s debates have also shifted from “Will bitcoin become a new currency?” to “How else can bitcoin make a difference in today’s financial system?”. With that said, the vast majority of altcoins were inspired by Bitcoin’s success with the rest due to dissatisfaction. The financial systems of the world are broken and as always, the casualties turn out to be none other than the the populations of the affected national currencies. As a result, millions of people have turned to bitcoin as a safe haven to escape the financial chaos. Altcoins are not be the go-to asset during the financial chaos currently being experienced in Venezuela, India, and China, however, some altcoins have a role to play in the other areas of the cryptocurrency ecosystem. With currency wars currently escalating between the worlds major currencies, the last thing the cryptocurrency community needs is a ‘crypto-war’ between altcoin platforms. But as with any open and free market, healthy competition is certainly welcome and provides a great mechanism for selecting the best and most effective cryptocurrency features that may be suitable for inclusion in other cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. Different cryptocurrencies have reasons for their existence. However, altcoins, on the whole, are working towards fairly similar goals — to bring liberty back to people and contribute to the remake of the worlds legacy financial systems. The first way altcoins have complemented bitcoin is with liquidity. Altcoins with big transaction volumes make arbitrage feasible in the cryptocurrency markets. Investors can trade between bitcoin and other highly transacted altcoins to profit from the price differences. The second is by adding anonymity and privacy. Bitcoin transactions are pseudonymous and not anonymous. When an identity is tied to a bitcoin address, then all associated transactions can be linked to it. In the cryptocurrency market, a few altcoins (such as Monero) try to offer more anonymous transactions (but the jury is still out on whether currencies such as Monero are “more private” than others). However, some hardcore bitcoin fans would not hold other altcoins for extended periods despite these additional features, viewing Bitcoin as the gold standard of cryptocurrencies or the reserve currency. So how can altcoins help bitcoin to anonymize transactions? Bitcoin users can go to exchanges such as Shapeshift.io to exchange their bitcoin to altcoins and back — but to a different bitcoin address. By doing so, the layering of different coin addresses makes tracing of transactions much harder. The existence of altcoins also make any government’s attempt to “ban” bitcoin less meaningful (as there are many alternatives that could replace bitcoin). Some developers create altcoins to experiment with new features. And there is no better way to test the feasibility of any feature than the release of the experimenting altcoins onto the open market. As the value of the bitcoin network is so high, it would not be wise for developers to experiment with new features into bitcoin directly. Therefore, some altcoins are, in fact, testbeds for features that may some day end up being incorporated into bitcoin. Bitcoin is a stand-out in the crypto-crowd because of its vast network and infrastructure, including mobile wallets, exchanges  and payment processors. The inconvenient truth is that the majority of altcoins are exchanged back into bitcoin as this is the only convenient cryptocurrency that can be used to directly purchase goods or services. Thus, altcoins have inevitably complemented bitcoin and made bitcoin somewhat like the USD of the cryptocurrency market. The number of altcoins will likely continue to grow. But it is quite unlikely that all these altcoins will survive in a competitive cryptocurrency market. Note – There are many scams out there with the aim of separating people from their bitcoin in ‘pump and dump’ altcoin schemes. Research before investing into any altcoin is important.

In 1999, journalist Eric Corley explained to readers how to acquire DeCSS, a program that would allow them to view encrypted DVDs on their computers.  The Motion Picture Association of America sued him and a federal judge ordered Corley to remove the program from his website, as well as links to other sites where the program was hosted. Corley defended himself vigorously. DeCSS code is just a dozen or so lines of letters, numbers, and punctuation which work to disable encryption on commercial DVDs. Corley’s court case functioned essentially as a debate about whether the few lines of code was legal. As the New York Times pondered: “Is the program a machine, subject to government regulation like a car or a gun? Or is it language, protected by the First Amendment?” Corley’s supporters argued that the DeCSS code is human language, not machine language. They treated the codebase publicly as normal speech. The code was printed on t-shirts and performed as a folk song, appeared in a short film, and was even used as a haiku.  The court case and overarching debate were at the forefront of First Amendment and copyright law at the turn of the 21st century.  The M.P.A.A. sued the manufacturer of the DeCSS T-Shirt for ‘‘misappropriation of trade secrets.”  Its argument painted the “garment” as a “circumvention device” due to the code it featured.  DeCSS program’s proponents see the DeCSS code as letters and numbers — speech — which can be published and distributed freely.  As one lawyer supporting Corley argued, ‘‘If you can put it on a T-shirt, it’s speech.’’Bittorrent has been argued to be both a tool for free speech and anonymous speech. You could put the Bitcoin code on a T-shirt, though at 127 lines it might need to be XXL. For Echo messaging platform CEO Christopher Hering, Bitcoin and computer code in general is protected by the laws of free speech.  “They are great tools to express their creators visions,” Mr. Hering said. “Like an old masterpiece of Da Vinci, where every stroke, perspective and color was carefully chosen, modern computer code and software is an expression of carefully evaluated formulas, libraries and equations. Bitcoin is a modern masterpiece and express Satoshi’s vision of new internet money. Once you dig the details you understand his message of a free world where value can be exchanged among humans instantly and free from any institutional bodies.Borderless, governed by the code, Bitcoin allows it users to enter an economic agreement with each other and to express their free will to exchange product and services permissionless. Bitcoin is one of our best new tools to express our free will and speech among us humans.”  There are instances when mere numbers have come under attack, such as “illegal number“, which Bitcoin investor and lawyer Trace Mayer (BitPay, Armory, Kraken) evoked when contacted for this article. An ‘illegal number’ makes the possession of certain numbers illegal. The number could represent classified information, trade secrets, and, in the case of bitcoin potentially, illegal and/or laundered funds.  In 2012, for instance, China reportedly banned searches for the numbers 89, 6, 4 due to the date of the June Fourth Incident in Tiananmen Square, 1989. Other incidences of banned numbers have surfaced. In 2007 the Belgian minister of the Interior wrote to the Belgian Football Association to ask the organization to forbid fans from wearing the numbers 18 and 88 without names on the back of the jersey — due to the connotation they may have to Adolf Hitler for right-wing fans.   “This is an infringement on the disciplines of math and science,” argues Mr. Mayer. “It’s the same as persecuting Galileo for his views that the earth revolves around the sun.” Do you think Bitcoin’s code is a form of free speech?

However they now face a new wave of competitors with a magic trick in their pocket: bitcoin. We interviewed one of the leaders in the bitcoin betting space; Nitrogen Sports. Bitcoin.com spoke to Carlos, content manager at Nitrogen Sports. Here is everything you need to know about his company and its links to bitcoin. Also read: EURO 2016 Sees BTC Flow to Sports Betting Sites
 Bitcoin.com (BC): Could you please explain to our readers what Nitrogen Sports is all about?
 Carlos: Nitrogen Sports is an online gaming platform that allows players to bet with cryptocurrency. We offer an industry-leading sportsbook as well as a casino and an active poker room.
 BC: How is it different from the competition? Carlos: Bitcoin allows us to do things and to offer services that other fiat currency books can’t. For one, transfer in and out of our platform is seamless, giving players the benefit of short wait times on deposits and withdraws. Players don’t have to wait for credit card providers to clear amounts or for centralized banks to approve transfers. Wait times are left up to the player and the speed of the Bitcoin Blockchain.  BC: How do you generate revenues? Carlos: An an online sportsbook, casino, and poker room we generate revenue as any traditional sportsbook/casino would, through fixed commissions on our sportsbook and games. We have been fortunate to work with some great people who have helped us to set some of the most competitive commission rates in the industry. BC: How is your company dealing with regulation and does Bitcoin make things easier or trickier?   Carlos: When we entered the market, we weren’t the only player accepting bitcoin and we have since watched the space to grow and earn a reputation for its unique player benefits. Many of our fiat competitors are now accepting bitcoin and regulators are beginning to see bitcoin as a trustworthy and viable form of currency. We’re very fortunate to have earned an established spot in this industry and we hope see more players be introduced to the space. BC: Why are you using bitcoin as the medium for betting? What are the benefits of bitcoin in your industry? Carlos: Bitcoin offers a degree of flexibility for our players that other currencies simply can’t. As bitcoin grows as a payment tool, it’s going to become easier and easier to use, and it’s here where we are hope to see a semblance of mainstream acceptance for bitcoin gaming because as mentioned above, the benefits for the players are obvious. BC: Why did you choose bitcoin and not another cryptocurrency? Are you planning to add some other cryptocurrencies? Carlos: We chose bitcoin back in 2012 because it was the first real breakout cryptocurrency. As the space matures, we hope to bring on a more diverse range of cryptocurrencies […] dogecoin and litecoin to name a few. We always have our ear to the ground. zcash is exciting at the moment. We’re closely watching that as well.  BC: What plans do you have for the future (new features, growth)? Where do you see your company in 5 years? Carlos: We really believe in our mantra, which describes Nitrogen as the ‘future of betting’. We constantly innovate new features and products; recent examples include improved live betting and roulette. The new year looks really exciting for us and we can’t wait to share what’s in our pipeline with Nitrogen’s users.  What do you think about Nitrogen Sports? Ready to bet?

2016-12-16T12:00:14-04:00,Why Jim Harper Is Dead Wrong on Bitcoin,Elizabeth McCauley,https://news.bitcoin.com/lets-make-2017-year-bitcoin/,"It takes time to for an innovation to take off, especially one that is as large as an alternative global decentralized digital currency. January 2017 marks eight years since the first Bitcoin block was mined. In monetary systems, eight years is not a long time.  Also read: Bitcoin 2016: The Year of a Different Rise  When looking at how this past year went for perhaps the most disruptive fintech development to date, it’s important to acknowledge the uphill climb Bitcoin has faced since day one. Perhaps you read Jim Harper’s recent opinion piece in Coindesk and were a little put off about the state of Bitcoin development to date. Earlier this year, Bitcoin.com put together a ‘Top Ten Moments in Bitcoin’ video. Take three minutes to watch, and you will see that Bitcoin is not on the decline but continually reaching new highs.  Let’s just take a moment to consider the challenges any new emerging technology faces, let alone a global groundbreaking financial innovation. Bitcoin challenges the economic ecosystems of all nation states. From the first Bitcoin block mined with the message “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks”, to Satoshi’s early writings, Bitcoin challenges centralized financial structures.  With Bitcoin’s disruption comes a powerful solution, global financial inclusion. Bitcoin is competing with not just one country’s currency but all fiat currencies globally and is community driven, eliminating the backing and authority of governments and vested interests. Bitcoin is poised to take away power from multinational financial institutions and governments and will give financial power back to the people.    So what do we expect from a digital, decentralized disruptive technology? Do we expect that standing financial institutions will gladly accept a competitor that is highlighting many pain points of their current struggling system? Do we expect those who grasp Bitcoin’s potential to accept a digital currency issued by the same old centralized organization that is characteristic of fiat currency?  A ‘Yes’ to a centralized digital currency is akin to drinking cheap box wine now when you can wait a little bit longer for a bottle of 1787 Chateau d’Yquem.   The Bitcoin community of members, innovators, investors, developers, dreamers and users is global and does not discriminate based on race, gender, ethnicity or geographic location. Anyone can get involved and start using Bitcoin as there is such a low barrier to entry. In his opinion piece, Harper states, “Gold has literally thousands of years of social capital built up around it: Everyone knows what it is. A lot of people own or covet gold”.  In comparing Bitcoin to gold, he continues “By comparison, bitcoin has almost no social capital”. Although Bitcoin and gold do share some similar traits, Bitcoin’s reach extends far beyond that of gold in the areas of security, usability, and opportunity.  Let’s take a step back for a second. Globally, there are close to fifty official Bitcoin exchanges, and that is not even including many brokerages, ATMs and LocalBitcoins in countries around the world. Bitcoin is a viable Plan B for individuals who happen to have been born in countries with less developed financial systems.  In Venezuela, Bitcoin is coming to the rescue as hyperinflation sweeps through peoples savings. Demonetization is ravaging Indian citizens with Bitcoin being a viable alternative form of payment and store of value. Businesses struggle in Argentina with overbearing government authorities as Bitcoin enables enterprises to continue to operate. In Europe, Switzerland has a vibrant ATM network to enable citizens to buy and sell Bitcoin. Tech innovators have also gathered for the first Blockchain Summit in Botswana.  For the unbanked population across the globe, Bitcoin offers a ‘Plan B’ with promises of removing the ties to one’s national fiat currency and opening a gateway to global commerce and trade.   Discourse and dialogue around critical developments in an emerging technology are healthy. In Harper’s opinion piece, he refers to the scaling debate as a way of “putting people off.” Frankly, the fact that such a diverse group of individuals can debate and discuss numerous technical options before working together to come to consensus is a far superior outcome for those who traditionally have no input into the decisions of the monetary authorities. Would a centralized system without transparency be better?  Who said that a decentralized peer to peer network wouldn’t take work? What work is involved? Protecting ‘one of a kind’ innovations like Bitcoin from the weakness of centralization. It’s easy to come to conclusions about a new payment network when comparing it to centralized systems that do not have the same potential and diverse array of features, opportunities, and individuals involved.  Bitcoin represents an opportunity for you and I to reclaim our financial freedom and work together to provide greater opportunity for those who have been neglected by the current system that has failed to deliver opportunity and progress for large parts of the world.  As we close out 2016, let’s briefly look back at how far we have come, then look forward at the work still to be done and the ways to achieve these goals and objectives.  2017 is the year for Bitcoin.

2016-12-16T06:00:22-04:00,Russian Presidential Candidate to Accept Bitcoin for Campaign,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-candidate-accept-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin’s legality is still unclear in Russia, as the local government and authorities avoid to establish unified regulations and money transmission policies for bitcoin users, businesses and investors. However, a Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny, who has significant support from the people, is officially accepting bitcoin donations for his 2018 presidential campaign. Over the past few years, Russian President Vladimir Putin has made several remarks regarding bitcoin usage, censorship and businesses. On national television and various domestic TV networks like Russia 24, he stated that bitcoin can be used as an accounting unit. As Bitcoin.com reported on July 15, Putin also stated that Russia is not opposed to bitcoin or other digital currencies. Also read: Vladimir Putin Speaks Out in Favor of Bitcoin Alexei Navalny is a Russian lawyer, financial activist and a strong advocate against corruption and current Russian President Vladimir Putin. Since 2009, Navalny has gained serious prominence and exposure from the Russian mainstream media by leading democratic promotions. In the past, Nalvany continuously expressed concerns over the possibility of fair elections, stating that the presence of the United Russia party and Putin himself makes it difficult for any candidate in opposing parties to achieve success in presidential campaigns. He also noted that controversy surrounding electoral justice ultimately discouraged him and his team in leading an actual presidential campaign against United Russia. However, on December 13, Navalny announced his official bid to run for Russian presidency in 2018. In a video released on his official social media channels, Nalvany stated that he firmly believes he can win the polls by publicizing controversial discussions and political regimes that most political leaders in Russia refuse to talk about. “I am going to the polls, and I am going to fight to win. I am going to speak about things people refuse to talk about, but which it is high time were said,” he said. On his official campaign website, Nalvany and his team emphasized that it is not easy to achieve fair elections in Russia. To do so, the team needs adequate funds to finance regional headquarters and lawyers to ensure that justice is served during the elections. The Nalvany campaign management team listed four major methods of donations or funding, including Yandex, Bank Card, Paypal and bitcoin. “To achieve the participation of Alexei Navalny in the elections is not easy and to achieve fair elections is even more difficult. Your donations [will finance] the work of the regional headquarters and lawyers. Donations are crucial for an opposition party that has substantially less support compared to Putin’s. More importantly, 46 million people, approximately 32% of the Russian population, are underbanked or don’t have access to banking services. Thus, for the working class seeking for anti-corruption and an advocate for democracy, decentralized currencies like bitcoin could be easier to obtain and facilitate. “In the Russian Federation, uneven access to financial services and low levels of financial literacy have left approximately one-third (46 million) of the country’s people either unbanked or underbanked. Residents of remote regions are particularly underserved as banks find it costly and unprofitable to set up and operate branches,” said researchers at the Alliance For Financial inclusion.  Interestingly, the bitcoin price in Russia hit new multi-year highs in November, above the peak in 2013. It demonstrated the increasing demand for bitcoin but a lack of infrastructure, bitcoin exchange market and liquidity to support that demand. Do you think the general population will fund Navalny’s presidential campaign with bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below. Image via Ribttes How much do you want to know?

2016-12-15T19:00:32-04:00,FX Markets Shrink While Bitcoin Expands,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/fx-market-shrinks-bitcoin-expands/,"Daily foreign exchange market volumes have shrunk for the first time in 15 years, according to the Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Banks are increasingly becoming worried as the BIS, which is owned by central banks, warns them of impending financial stability risks. On the other hand, the bitcoin price continues to rise, reaching its highest level in the last three years. Also read: Bitcoin 2016: the Year of a Different Rise The magnitude of foreign exchange trade shrinkage is alarming banking authorities. The BIS is carefully analyzing the downsizing of FX markets. Sixty central banks comprise the BIS, representing 95 percent of the world GDP. Specifically, the BIS indicates, “Global FX turnover fell to $5.1 trillion per day in April 2016, from $5.4 trillion in April 2013.” (See graph 1)  According to the BIS, the causes for the FX markets downsizing have been due to a variety of factors: “The decline in trading by leveraged institutions and ‘fast money’ traders, and a reduction in risk appetite have contributed to a significant drop in spot market activity. More active trading of FX derivatives, largely for hedging purposes, has provided a partial offset. Many FX dealer banks have become less willing to warehouse risk and have been re-evaluating their prime brokerage business. At the same time, new technologically driven non-bank players have gained firmer footing as market-makers and liquidity providers.” The implications of this phenomenon are already far-reaching. For example, the foreign exchange downsizing is affecting the City of London. London is one of the biggest foreign currency trading centers, where 37 percent of global currency trading occurs. “The world’s foreign exchange markets have shrunk for the first time on record in a downturn that poses a big challenge for the City, the global leader in the buying and selling of currencies,” reports The Times. Fiat currencies are also suffering because of physical cash shortages. In India, the economy is grinding to a halt because of the demonetization initiative that aims to void 86 percent of Indians’ cash. Likewise, Venezuela is implementing a demonetization plan, which involves withdrawing from circulation the largest denominated-bill, the 100-bolivar notes. As a result, authorities now fear the smuggling of cash, forcing them to close their borders with Colombia and Brazil. Moreover, the economic turmoil in Zimbabwe deepened further, following its Reserve Bank’s decision to impose cash withdrawal limits. Bitcoin continues to gain strength as shown by its price. Indeed, bitcoin is moving closer and closer towards USD 800, while daily trading volumes are also increasing. Also, bitcoin is gaining wider acceptance. For example, the mainstream media is starting to show it in a more positive light. “Bitcoin is predicted to rise 165% to $2,000 in 2017, driven by Trump’s ‘spending binge’ and dollar rally,” says CNBC. Reuters also reports on the spectacular rise of the cryptocurrency, pointing out that “bitcoin has climbed around 80 percent so far this year, far exceeding its 35 percent rise in 2015.” Moreover, bitcoin’s value has steadily surpassed the price of gold by an impressive margin, during 2016. “The digital currency has more than doubled in value, while the yellow metal has gained 8.73 percent,” reports Forbes. Today, the combination of an obsolete institution such as traditional banking and a three-thousand-year-old fiat monetary system are showing cracks all around. In contrast, bitcoin continues to strengthen and mature. How do you think the shrinking of the foreign exchange market will affect Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-15T12:00:23-04:00,How Practical is it to Live on Bitcoin in Philippines and South Korea?,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/live-bitcoin-philippines-south-korea/,"A chart based on the practicality of bitcoin for daily expenditures was introduced on many popular bitcoin online forums, including Reddit. The user, who goes by the alias “themetalfriend” is a bitcoin enthusiast who formulated the chart after using bitcoin to finance his day-to-day life in Germany.  The communities and online forums that saw the bitcoin practicality chart expressed interest in seeing a similar breakdown or analysis in other countries. Thus, considering the rapid emergence of innovative bitcoin startups in Asia and my personal experience of using bitcoin in South Korea and the Philippines, I have evaluated bitcoin practicality in those two countries. Also read: Philippines Customers Can Pay Consumer Loans, Bills with Bitcoin The Philippines has experienced a surge in the growth of its bitcoin userbase. Coins.ph, the most popular and widely-used application in the country, is also one of the most-used applications and web-based platforms across all categories including games, content sharing, social media, etc. Coins.ph is a remittance-focused bitcoin application that enables anyone in the country to live solely on bitcoin without any discomfort or inefficiency. Directly from its mobile application, people can purchase and sell bitcoin through bank ATMs, physical bank branches, remittance outlets and convenience stores. Thus, for users trying to avoid owning fiat, it is highly recommended. The application also allows users to avoid using fiat and deal only with bitcoin to finance daily expenditures. Specifically, users can pay tuition, utility bills such as internet, rental, water and electricity fees, settle credit card bills and send remittances to anywhere in the Philippines with bitcoin. Essentially, Coins.ph transforms bank-issued credit cards into bitcoin credit cards, as users don’t need fiat to pay for their card bills. A local user also told Bitcoin.com that she began to use Coins.ph after they simplified buying mobile credits using bitcoin. Traditionally, users have to visit physical stores and wait long lines, usually hours, to purchase credits. She was first introduced to bitcoin at a technology event called Geeks on a Beach. “I used it to purchase load for my phone. I used the credits given away by coins.ph at Geeks on a Beach. I eventually ran out of credits, and I wanted to purchase more.” she said. The Philippines has a surprisingly large number of vendors, online merchants, and platforms that accept direct bitcoin payments. In Manila, coffee shops and restaurants accept direct bitcoin payments and local e-commerce platforms including Pinoy Travel and Metrodeal partnered with Coins.ph to accept bitcoin. Apart from Coins.ph, platforms like Rebit.ph and BuyBitcoin.ph make bitcoin-based remittances simple, as any worker or resident from the Philippines can send money back to the country with low fees. The recipient has the choice to either accept the payment in bitcoin or cash. Overall, avoiding fiat money for durable goods, food, rent, and utilities is made practical with bitcoin in the Philippines. Anyone can also practically purchase goods, food and settle utility bills directly with bitcoin at ease. South Korea, one of the major fintech hubs in Asia competes against global leaders such as Singapore, China, and Hong Kong. It has seen a rapid growth in its bitcoin industry as well since 2014. South Korean startups were some of the first bitcoin-focused companies in Asia to receive venture capital funding from prominent investors like multi-billion dollar angel investor Tim Draper. In most cases, payment settlements happen through digital networks and banking systems. Physical cash is rarely used in Korea, as credit card service providers have successfully unified the majority of transportation and utility settlement systems with their networks. Because South Korean users were already used to dealing with digitalized financial networks, its general population adopted bitcoin quite quickly, as startups installed bitcoin ATMs in national universities and popular tourist spots. The introduction of bitcoin ATMs led to active mainstream media countries, spurring the growth of companies like Coinplug. Coinplug, a Tim Draper-backed company, is one of the few bitcoin companies in the world today that focuses on simplifying bitcoin transfers and spending. The company successfully transformed over 20,000 convenience stores in South Korea to bitcoin over-the-counter exchanges, enabling each ATM in the convenience store to facilitate bitcoin-to-fiat trading. However, Coinplug and other bitcoin startups like Korbit are heavily cash-reliant. While they simplify purchasing and selling of bitcoin for fiat, local South Korean apps don’t have features that allow direct spending of bitcoin like apps in the Philippines and Thailand. Thus, holding onto bitcoin as an investment is extremely efficient in Korea, as users can withdraw small amounts of fiat each time they’re in urgent of cash convenience stores nationwide. However, none of the startups in South Korea helps users avoid using fiat in any form. Do you wish to see bitcoin practicality analysis on other countries? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-15T06:00:01-04:00,New Bitcoin Wallet Features Plausible Deniability,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-wallet-plausible-deniability/,"We’ve seen it in the films. Someone’s forced with violence to give up sensitive data and allow a bad actor to extract wealth from a hostage. Also Read: Three New Hard Wallets for 2016 Not Named Trezor Bitcoiners worry about this, too. On forums where enthusiasts of the cryptocurrency hang out, a popular refrain for some is: “if someone had a gun to your head, you’d probably give up your bitcoin wallet private key.” Fair enough. But a particular bitcoin hardware wallet, which boasts some of the space’s most experienced coders, has added a technical solution to this age-old conundrum. The wallet, Digital Bitbox, features plausible deniability as part of its operations. So, what if a government, bully or cold-blooded criminal tries to force you to open your bitcoin wallet?  “Use plausible deniability,” co-founder and programmer Douglas Bakkum proposes. “This is done in two ways. A secondary password can be set that accesses a fully functional hidden wallet. Put some change in it to add plausibility. Or, in case you are forced to recover a wallet from a backup, entering the wrong password will create a valid but different wallet. One could put some change there too.” UPDATE: The popular Trezor has also featured a similar feature in its celebrated Bitcoin hardware wallet, whereby more than one passphrase can be used to foster “plausible deniability.”, even though its creator SatoshiLabs doesn’t highlight this feature very often. A mantra for Digital Bitbox is ‘security in simplicity.” What does this mean?  “Less code means less things that could go wrong and makes auditing the code easier, like finding the things that can go wrong,” suggested Bakkum, whose partner on the open-source hardware wallet project is bitcoin core developer Jonas Schnelli “The physical design is purposely nondescript and minimal in order to avoid unwanted attention.”  Maybe the most unique feature of Digital Bitbox is the backup and recovery process. “We use an onboard slot for a micro SD card, which gives a number of advantages along with much greater convenience to the user,” he explained.  An SD card is not required during normal use. It is only when creating a new wallet, or when reloading a wallet from a saved backup.  “The backup process is completely offline and completely automated such that the only thing an owner needs to do is put the SD card somewhere safe,” Mr. Bakkum explains. “Other wallets require a lengthy and somewhat tedious process of writing down a list of 12 to 24 words as a backup, and on recovery, re-entering the long list of words, often through an interface connected to the internet.” With Digital Bitbox, secrets — like passwords and keys — never touch the internet. “A side benefit of our approach is the simplicity and speed to create, reload, and switch between different wallets,” he says. “One could make a wallet for a savings account and another for a checking account. Or one could exchange coins, offline and privately, by exchanging an SD card.”  The backup is saved as a PDF file on the micro SD card for convenience.  “The micro SD card can be plugged into a trusted printer if one wishes to also make a paper backup.” Backups are a string of characters that is the wallet’s seed. “The seed in combination with the device password is used to derive the wallet’s BIP32 extended master private key,” Mr. Bakkum goes over. “This is functionally equivalent to an encrypted wallet but better. Specifically, the derivation purposely takes a lot of computational time, which greatly reduces the possibility to brute force attack the backup.” Recipients can access the coins with their own Digital Bitbox, or by using a client-side javascript Backup Center, which shows how to recover a wallet without possessing a Digital Bitbox.  “The firmware is signed with our company keys,” says Mr. Bakkum. “Only the correct signed firmware can be run, which means that a hacker cannot steal your device and install malicious code. The firmware is deterministically built, which means that an owner can, by oneself, build the code and load it onto the device in order to be sure that what is on the Github repository is really what is on the device. In other words, the firmware can be trusted without the need to trust us.”  Perhaps Digital Bitbox’s most notable product is its security chip. “All keys and passwords are stored isolated on a separate high-security chip designed specifically to keep your secrets secret,” explains the co-founder and programmer. “The chip contains physical security features to stop an attacker from physically reading data on the chip. This includes tamper detectors for voltage, temperature, frequency, and light, an active metal shield over the circuitry, and internal memory encryption. The point is to make accessing the data too time-consuming and requiring too costly of equipment to be worth the effort.” This might be considered overkill in most cases. “For us, It is one of multiple steps we take that will make attackers give up before they start, and instead seek easier targets,” he says. The chip has a 50-year lifespan. Despite a litany of techie features, the hardware wallets overall goal is to keep it simple.  “The minimalist design is important for both security and simplicity,” says the Digital Bitbox co-founder. “It is a guiding principle for us, for example, when thinking about the user experience, the code on the device, and product design. A primary goal is to make the user experience as simple and straightforward as possible. In general, making cryptocurrencies easy is an important issue in the community and an obstacle to more widespread adoption.” What do you think about plausible deniability in the bitcoin wallet space?

At the end of October, the Swiss rail service SBB released a statement that they were to sell bitcoin on their ticket machines in all train stations in Switzerland, effective November 11th. This pilot project is to last for a minimum of two years and is operated by Swiss financial services company Sweepay. To buy bitcoins, the customers only need a phone number and a Bitcoin wallet. The cap is fixed at CHF 500 (EUR 460, USD 500) per transaction. As the SBB ticket machines are now turned into Bitcoin Teller Machines (BTMs), the Swiss BTMs network just became super dense with more than 1000 BTMs working around the clock. Bitcoin.com tested this feature on the first day. Below are our impressions as well as some usersâ feedbacks and an exclusiveÂ interview withÂ Sweepay CEOÂ Rodolphe Texier.

If you experience trouble scanning the QR code, maybe try with another Bitcoin wallet by choosing another one here, and/or try to increase luminosity on yourÂ phone’s screen. When it got scanned, we needed to enter the desired amount to be purchased (any sum between CHF 20 and CHF 500) and confirm the offer received. There was a transaction fee of approximately 6% and also an exchange rate fee, leading to higher costs than what regular BTMs in Switzerland offer. After reviewing the offer, we needed to confirm the transaction by entering the security code (mTAN) we received on our phone via a text message. Finally, we paid the required amount in CHF: cash or debit card possible, no credit card allowed, though. A few minutes later, we saw the transaction in our wallet and could check on the Bitcoin blockchain that the coins were being successfully transferred to us. We asked around in the train station to get feedback from travelers about this unique feature. Fred was not aware of it and said: âI am not sure if I would use it, I bought one bitcoin as an investment once on an exchange but I donât buy on a regular basis so this is not useful to me, but I can imagine it could be to other people.”Â We also got the chance to chat online with someone who tried the feature out (the interviewee requested to remain anonymous): Bitcoin.com (BC): Why did you use the Sweepay/SBB buy bitcoins feature? A.: To have some spending money on my mobile. I have a stash of bitcoin on (purposefully) hard to access cold storage, so it is not for ‘investment’. For that I would also put more effort into getting a better price. But it is very convenient for filling my phone’s wallet with an amount of BTC that is roughly equivalent to the amount of cash money that I carry in my wallet.
 BC: What are the positive aspects of the Sweepay/SBB BTC feature? A.: They are everywhere. This will not be an advantage to anyone living in ZÃ¼rich, Geneva or Basel, where you have a choice of low-price BTMs, but I live in Fribourg, and there is nothing here. No BTM, no Mycelium local trader. And I don’t want to connect any of the services to my bank account, so for me the closest would be the BTM in Bern, which has inconvenient opening hours (it’s in a billiard place that only opens at 11:30). So for me it is fine to pay the premium for the SBB ticket machine (for smaller amounts) over taking the trip to Bern. BC: What are the negative aspects of the Sweepay/SBB BTC feature? A.: That they require your mobile number, and getting even a prepaid one requires you to present an ID. They require it (as far as I can see) to make sure you stay below a limit every year, which probably eases regulatory issues for them. I am sympathetic to that reason, but in the end it is less private than I would like it to be.  A second major drawback is of course the price. They claim 6% fee, which is not perfect already, but fine. The nearest proper BTM in Bern takes 5%. But the exchange rate is very unfavorable as well. Yesterday around 19:30, they used an exchange rate of 795.37 BTC/CHF. It should have been closer to 774 BTC/CHF, if I am generous. I don’t have the exact time but around that time there was a bump from 769 to 774. So I paid an additional 2.7% on top of the 6% fee. BC: Do you believe this feature will be used by the mainstream? A.: I don’t think so. The cities where there are stores that accept BTC are also the cities where there are cheaper BTMs. I appreciate that there is now a widespread offer throughout Switzerland, the price of which of course also serves as an upper bound for other actors like Localbitcoins or “Mycelium local trader” traders, but that’s about it. BC: What do you think would be the next steps for SBB when it comes to bitcoin? A.: I don’t think they will accept bitcoin any time soon. In the ticket machines the bitcoin selling option is at the ‘prepaid’ category, next to several options to top up your mobile balance. The SBB is a service provider to Sweepay, because theirÂ machines know how to take in money, have a QR scanner and are spread out around Switzerland. SBB does not have any own skin in the game. And if it was a dip-toe-into-water test on how much interest there is in bitcoin from customers, that’s probably a failed experiment. I’d of course love to see numbers from Sweepay, but due to the high price and the somewhat niche market it’s only useful in smaller cities where there’s noÂ BTM, where on the other hand there is also not much demand due to lack of accepting businesses. I’d guess the numbers are pretty low. We also got the chance to talk toÂ Sweepay CEO Rodolphe Texier who took the time to share his views on the joint project after a month of existence (in collaboration with SBB representatives).  Bitcoin.com (BC): Could you please elaborate on the joint project a little bit (origins and history, people involved, problems, vision, etc.)? Rodolphe Texier (RT): Sweepay as a “prepaid value” distributor in Switzerland identified Bitcoin as an eligible prepaid product given the status of Bitcoin in Switzerland from a tax and compliance point of view. Since the distribution of Bitcoin is more suitable from vending machines than at POS, we identified SBB ticketing machines as an excellent channel to expand bitcoin distribution since these machines are already distributing prepaid products like mobile top-ups. Facilitating the acquisition of bitcoin is the primary objective of the service with SBB. The vision is to facilitate and possibly accelerate the adoption of crypto-currencies in Switzerland through existing digital or physical channels. BC: What are the benefits of the SBB/Sweepay BTC feature? RT: The size of the network. Almost every Swiss resident is close to a train station. Also, theÂ availability of the network, it’s openÂ 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Also, the
quality of service, i.e. the reliability of SBB ticketing machines. BC:Â What could be seen as negative aspects of the SBB/Sweepay BTC feature? The service requires a Swiss mobile phone number to purchase bitcoin, which is a “must have” for Sweepay being a financial intermediary, as we’re responsible for the compliance of such a service.
 BC: Could you please expand a little bit on the numbers? How many bitcoin transactions have been processed on the SBB ticket machines in a month? The service meets our expectation in terms of volume and number of transactions so far. BC: Where are the most successful ticket machines? Large cities or places without regular Bitcoin Teller Machines (BTMs)? BC: Do you believe this Sweepay/SBB feature will be used by the massesÂ in the future? The aim of the service is to facilitate the acquisition of bitcoin. To be used by the massesÂ a large ecosystem and related services will need to be put in place in Switzerland as well. BC: What are the next steps for Sweepay when it comes to Bitcoin? SweePay is working especially on services which could facilitate the use of Bitcoin. BC: Do you plan to replicate this in some other countries? Even if our primary focus is Switzerland, we are now looking to expand our Bitcoin services to other countries through strategic partnerships. Bitcoin.comÂ could not access more specific details about transactions numbers and volumes as it is confidential information.Â Overall the project seems to work smoothly and is well received by users. It will be interesting to follow this project throughout out the years and also assess if it develops in some additional countries around the world as it can obviously help grow Bitcoin adoption. What do you think about the Sweepay/SBB “buy bitcoins” feature, have you tried it?Â Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-14T15:00:38-04:00,Unlocking Bitcoin’s Hidden Purchasing Power,Jon Hoos,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-network-effect-purchasing-power/,"With the addition of some simple price information within bitcoin wallets, the change in purchasing power of one’s bitcoins would be immediately apparent to the owner and would enable a better understanding of value when making spending decisions. In my opinion this knowledge would prompt more people to hold bitcoin and would drive adoption. Before the introduction of HD wallets (HD means Hierarchically Deterministic and these wallets seamlessly and automatically generate a new public key each time you receive bitcoin), you had to manually generate a new public key for each and every transaction if you wanted to preserve any of your own privacy and the privacy of the Bitcoin network. Also read: ‘Only One Blockchain Matters’ an Interview With Bobby Lee The advent of HD wallets was a unique turn in the bitcoin space because it meant that the entire network of users benefited from a seamless feature that nobody had to think about. It just happened automatically. As a result of this new standard, everyone in the network had more privacy and security. But what if there was a way to add a wallet feature that enabled seamless profitability to the entire network of users? Or at least allowed people to make more educated spending decisions without having to do any extra work? Well, let me show you how I propose that this can happen. I can’t wait for the day when we all look back at how we calculated the average cost of our coins manually? That was so 2017! Hahahaha.” In order to know the exact cost of your coins, you need to know the exact amount that you paid and the exact amount of coin that you received (all the way out to the satoshi). You then divide the amount that you spent by the amount of bitcoin that you have, to get your average cost. So, here’s how a BASIC cost calculator works. Note: I am not trying to make super complex calculators that will confuse the average user. I am using basic arithmetic (addition, subtraction, and division in this case) so if you are some sort of Wall Street math genius, please take it easy with any comments you may have. This is just what I personally propose to us normal folk who want to better manage our bitcoin. If you are a merchant, please use a system like this rather than exchanging your bitcoin transactions at the point of sale! Tools like this calculator will allow you to know exactly how much your coins are worth and when you should hold them and when to spend them. Bitcoin’s economic value lies in savings, not in selling to an exchange at point of sale to avoid a 2-3% payment processor fee. Those savings are significant, but that’s not going to change your business revenue drastically. Implementing math calculators like this will. I also believe that more merchants will have an incentive to hold onto the coins they receive when they see the increased purchasing power of BTC which will likely put even more upward pressure on the price. This is the deflationary power of sound money. To get started, you are going to need a spreadsheet of some sort. For this tutorial I am going to use a Google Spreadsheet because it’s free, makes automated calculations and can easily import a live BTC price via Google Finance. If privacy is super important to you, you can manually calculate these numbers with a pen and paper so no online entity can see how many coins you have or how much you’ve paid for them. I am only using an electronic spreadsheet to automate this process as much as possible so you can focus more on what you’re going to buy with all of your increased purchasing power. The first thing you need to know is how to get the spreadsheet to make automated calculations. To do this, all you need to do is use an equals sign “=” When you do this, you are basically programming the spreadsheet to execute a very basic math command. We will be using this command quite a bit in this tutorial, so please feel free to experiment with this in your own spreadsheet. You can do all of this however you want, but I have just a few columns to do everything. Again, this is all simple arithmetic from elementary school.  Box A2: =GOOGLEFINANCE(“CURRENCY:BTCUSD”) This uses Google Finance to pull a feed of the Bitcoin price every few minutes or so. This is very important because this is half of what will automatically calculate your profit/loss per coin. You can use whatever fiat currency you want in here by replacing USD with the three letter currency code of your choice.                       Great Britain Pounds, =GOOGLEFINANCE(“CURRENCY:BTCGBP”) Brazilian Reals, =GOOGLEFINANCE(“CURRENCY:BTCBRL”) Euros, =GOOGLEFINANCE(“CURRENCY:BTCEUR”) and so on. The spreadsheet will automatically display the exchange rates for those corresponding currencies. Do some experimenting to see the rates of multiple fiat currencies in real time. It would be awesome if Google Finance were able to pull the price of all of the cryptos from CoinCap.io so you could use a spreadsheet like this to easily trade between cryptocurrencies using this method but we will just have to wait til Google includes such a feature. Column A4-A?: The Date – This is easy. The date of every transaction is locked in the blockchain forever, so this should be pretty easy to find if you have a record of your transactions in your wallet. Unfortunately, you will have to manually enter this for each buy and sell transaction. This is optional, but it helps to find transactions later for tax reasons or any other reason that you may need.  Column B: Fiat Currency – The spreadsheet formula for this is =sum(B4: B) This simply adds every number in this B column starting with row 4. This is where you learn the total amount of money (fiat) you have spent to acquire all of your bitcoins. I use USD, but you can enter anything you want. USD, GBP, EUR, BRL, Argentine pesos, Zimbabwe dollars or even French assignats if you want. When you accept bitcoin as payment or buy bitcoin with fiat, you will need to add that transaction to a line. In this column, you will need to add a “-” anytime you spend fiat for BTC or receive BTC for goods/services and use a positive number when you spend bitcoin for goods/services or sell coins. I have color coded the lines to make it easier to identify acquisition of BTC (buy/receive) vs. utilization of BTC (sell/spend). GREEN boxes are receive/buy, and RED boxes are spend/sell. If you have positive or negative numbers in both columns, then something is wrong, and this will mess up your end result.  Column C: Bitcoin – The spreadsheet formula for this is =sum(C4:C) and this is just like the sum we created earlier. This simply adds all of your Bitcoin in the C column starting with line 4.  Column D: Average Cost per Bitcoin – The spreadsheet formula for this is =-(B2/C2). The formula for this is simply fiat spent divided by Bitcoin received. Note: The – (negative sign) is VERY important because this is what will give you a positive cost per coin since you are going to be dividing a negative number (fiat spent) by a positive number (BTC received)  Column E: Profit/Loss or Purchasing Power! – This is where the magic happens! The spreadsheet formula is “=A2/D2” (Current Price/Average Cost). This means that you are dividing the current price by your average cost per coin. If this number is more than 100%, then you are in the black and ready to find something awesome to buy with the world’s best sound money. If you spend some bitcoin while the price is above your average cost, you will notice that your average cost will actually come down because you are tapping into your increased value. Note: You might notice a euphoric feeling or have a moment of clarity when you realize the potential here. Let that good feeling soak in and enjoy it because it only gets better over time.  In my example here I currently have an additional 541% of purchasing power (you need to subtract 100% for your initial investment) which means that bitcoin has enabled me to purchase 541% more of whatever I buy. 541% more groceries at Whole Foods, 541% more computer at NewEgg, 541% more of whatever goods and services you need and want. This is the true economic power of bitcoin and why it’s not just some dumb internet money. This means that a $250 Playstation4 would only cost $38.97 …plus tax. Just to put this further into perspective, 20% annual gains in the stock market is considered a very good return on investment. If millions of bitcoin users around the world implemented this practice, it would further stimulate the deflationary nature of bitcoin. It would enable more people to make educated purchasing decisions, stimulate more people holding their bitcoins — and more people would see purchasing power gains far greater than 541% but rather thousands and even tens of thousands of percentage gains in purchasing power. That is why I believe that it’s so important for wallet developers to build this functionality into every wallet on the planet. So the entire Bitcoin network can benefit from more people holding their coins instead of selling them to an exchange so they can just spend fiat. It is important to note that this calculator is not perfect because after receiving/buying low and spending/selling high, your average cost per coin will actually fall below $0 and so the math presented here will change and start to give you all sorts of crazy numbers that won’t make sense. This will probably require some sort of IF…THEN… command to provide a positive number or negative number. I will work on some sort of workaround for this issue. If you know how to fix this, please leave a comment below. Disclaimer: My example shown is not the best example because I used the price from the 1st of every month, but the price often fell lower than on the first of the month so you would be better off placing manual purchase orders so you could potentially end up with even more purchasing power than what is shown above. Yes, I said, even MORE, PURCHASING POWER than 541% gains.  Let us know what you think about using simple math like this to increase the network effect of bitcoin’s purchasing power with a comment below. Images via Shutterstock How much do you want to know?

2016-12-14T12:00:10-04:00,"Venezuela Prints Bills, Closes Borders – Bitcoin to the Rescue",Jérémie Guélat,https://news.bitcoin.com/venezuela-hyperinflation-bitcoin-rescue/,"Venezuela is the world’s worst performing economy, hit by 700% hyperinflation and sinking in debt. Its currency, the bolivar, is currently losing half its value every 18 days. However, the government announced on Monday that it will remove the country’s largest banknote (100 VEF, worth $0.02 on the black market) over a 72 hours period. We tried to assess the potential impacts this will have on the Venezuelan population, and how bitcoin can come to the rescue. As all countries suffering from hyperinflation have done in the past (with absolutely no success — think Weimar Republic, Zimbabwe, Argentina, etc.), the Venezuelan government just announced the removal of the largest currency denomination (100 VEF, only worth 2 U.S. cents). They’ll also print larger ones (up to 20,000 VEF, due on Thursday). With hyperinflation expected to reach a staggering 1600% next year according to the IMF, one can easily foresee a situation where the government will repeat this process until the currency is dead and citizens’ wealth gone with it. Venezuelan authorities used the same “excuse” as the Indian government for removing the large banknotes, namely “to eliminate corruption and fight mafia.” The lack of planning and future roadmap is likely to result in a cash chaos in Venezuela as it did in India. However, the economic situation in Venezuela is much worse, hence one can fear that the consequences for the population there could be even more tragic. Also read: Following Demonetization India Is Changing Its Outlook On Bitcoin President Maduro also decided to close the borders with Colombia on Monday, preventing any additional capital flight out of the country. But this move will also prevent the population to access foods and other supplies that were being imported from Colombia, as basic supplies shortages are now too common in Venezuela.  In a country hit by hyperinflation and infinite money printing, blocked by capital controls and closed borders, bitcoin often comes to mind: Venezuela is ranked 2nd in the Bitcoin Market Potential Index (BMPI), measuring where in the world the potential for bitcoin adoption is the greatest. With its unique characteristics (borderless, outside of governments manipulation, anti-inflationary, finite supply, decentralized, censorship-resistant), bitcoin could be a lifeboat that previous generations never had. One can already notice how bitcoin is able to bring supplies into the country when almost all other ways are not working anymore. Bitcoin.com asked some Venezuelan bitcoin users to outline the impacts that Maduro’s decision will likely have and how bitcoin can come to the rescue in their country. Bitcoin.com got insights from within Venezuela and talked to a few people, who must remain anonymous for security and political reasons. Please note: names have been modified and translations from Spanish into English are the article authors. As a Venezuelan, what impacts will the demonetization have on you and your compatriots? What is happening nowadays since President Maduro decided to take out the 100 bolivars bills out of the economy? Armando: Among several things that this will likely bring is more and more devaluation and economic instability. The shops are closed, there is no consumer activity as even the debit/credit cards readers are too slow or just off. Many people have been victims of thefts because they had to carry huge stacks of bills in their wallets or bags. How are the people reacting to it now? What are they doing to preserve their wealth? Armando: Right now there is this atmosphere of chaos with all of these economic measures that have been implemented during last week. People could benefit from converting into US dollars which are more stable, but it is not possible, they are trapped. It would help if there were free flows of currencies (the US dollars) in our territory. How are you using bitcoin to avoid the worsening economic situation in your country? How can bitcoin help in this dire situation? How is the bitcoin ecosystem evolving in your country? What changes do you see? Armando: The truth is that bitcoin helps us to guard and protect our money outside of any economic measure that the government will implement to harm us. Each day the trading community is growing in Venezuela, but it grows in mere clandestinity, very very underground. Are you afraid that the government may condemn you and your activities related to bitcoin? Armando: Of course! Talking about bitcoin in Venezuela is a taboo subject. As the economic situation in Venezuela worsens, more and more people do like our interviewees and turn to bitcoin. Buying, mining, trading the cryptocurrency that has real value in the entire world. Venezuelans can use Localbitcoins or Surbitcoin to buy/sell bitcoins with bolivars, as they can use the AirTM app to convert their near to worthless bolivars into a more stable currency “in the cloud.” Weekly Localbitcoins volumes are increasing a lot in Venezuela, as shown in the graph below.  Braving the fear of the repressive government, mining activities are also growing in Venezuela, and represent the last chance of survival for some Venezuelan miners who must remain underground, in the collapsing socialist country. Venezuela is a reminder that all fiat currencies can go bust, but this time there’s an alternative that was not available to the residents of the other 57 times national currencies that have hyper-inflated since 1975; Bitcoin.

2016-12-13T18:00:47-04:00,Best Selling Financial Author: Bitcoin Is the New Safe Haven Asset,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/best-selling-financial-author-bitcoin-new-safe-haven-asset/,"Holger Zschaepitz, best selling financial author of “A book on states’ addictiveness to debt” and senior editor at Welt, recently discovered an intriguing relationship between gold and bitcoin: when gold plummets in value, the price of bitcoin surges. Based on this trend, he noted that bitcoin is beginning to be recognized as the new global safe haven asset. For centuries, gold was the world’s safe haven asset, attracting the likes of high profile investors, traders and companies for its long-term stability and physical characteristics. However, as regulations and policies on cash and gold holdings have tightened over the past few years, the value of gold has gradually declined. Also read: Royal Mint Announces Gold-Backed Blockchain Settlement Most recently, the Indian government restricted the importation of gold and began to tax, confiscate and seize the precious metal from its people. On December 12, India’s largest gold importer Axis Bank, suspended bullion dealer accounts, leading to an abrupt surge in gold premiums. “We have temporarily suspended transactions in a few current accounts as a part of a larger enhanced due diligence exercise being conducted on transactions post-demonetisation,” an Axis Bank representative said in an interview. More to that, the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF) began to seize gold and cash at 10 airports across various cities in India, seizing 245kg of gold within the four weeks from November 10 to December 8. On the global average market price, 245kg of gold is equivalent to around US$9.1 million.  China, which overtook India to become the world’s largest importer of gold in 2014, has also begun to see significant increase in gold premiums amid restrictions on gold importation. On December 2, China gold premiums reached a 3-year high, as gold was sold in the local market at about $24 an ounce, per Thomson Reuters Data. “Supply has been limited and so the premiums have held firm,” said metals consultancy GFMS analyst Cameron Alexander. With China and India, two of the largest gold importers in the world today, restricting the importation of gold and imposing heavy regulations on gold holdings, the global gold market is gradually declining. Meanwhile, as Zschaepitz noted, the bitcoin price is on an upward trend, reaching its highest price since 2014 at most major bitcoin exchanges including Bitstamp. On a social media platform, Zschaepitz compared the price trend of gold and bitcoin on one data chart. The pink line on the graph representing bitcoin, notably increases in value as the yellow line on the graph, representing gold, declines in value. According to BraveNewCoin, a New Zealand-based digital currency data provider, China, the worlds largest gold importer, conducts approximately 96.25% of global bitcoin trade. Therefore, if the Chinese gold market continues to decline and a small portion of the market allocates their capital to bitcoin, this will likely boost the price of the digital currency. Two of the main reasons investors and traders are shifting from gold to bitcoin is the high liquidity and transportability of bitcoin. In some countries like India and Venezuela, the government has set up border patrols and airport police groups to disallow or restrict the transportation of assets like gold. Today for instance, the Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro closed the border with Colombia to “combat currency smuggling,” as India did with airport police groups to limit gold importation. If strict regulations and policies on gold continue, the value of bitcoin, a digitized store of value that presents significant advantages over gold in terms of liquidity and transportability, will sustain its upward trend in the long run. Do you think bitcoin has already overtaken gold as the global safe haven asset?  Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Carpe Ventures, Minitime"
2016-12-13T15:00:57-04:00,Coinsecure’s Benson Samuel: ‘India’s Bitcoin Interest Spiking’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/india-bitcoin-interest-benson-samuel/,"Over the course of the past few months, bitcoin use in India has been on the rise. During the first week of November Prime Minister Narendra Modi began a demonetization process removing high denomination rupee notes out of circulation. Since then the country has experienced a cash crisis and demand for bitcoin has grown exponentially.   Also read: ‘Only One Blockchain Matters’ an Interview With Bobby Lee Bitcoin.com recently chatted with Benson Samuel, founder of the Indian bitcoin-based company Coinsecure. Samuel gave our readers some insight into the company’s platform, why they started the business and the current demand for cryptocurrency within the region.   Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you tell our readers about the Coinsecure platform? Benson Samuel (BS): Sure! We have built out the most advanced trading platform in India which allows users to place their bids and asks, and orders are matched and executed. In addition to that, we have recently expanded our services to let people across the globe leverage the arbitrage opportunities currently prevailing in India with easy access to our trading platform.  Our wallet services allows users to store, send and receive funds globally. We also have the most comprehensive API (Websocket and REST) which allows other businesses to plug in and use our backend technology. Our merchant payment gateway allows businesses to accept Bitcoin at a 0% volatility risk and our most recent development has been the Android app for the exchange where people can now trade bitcoin on the go. BC: What inspired you to start a bitcoin company in India? BS: There was nobody looking at building out a tech-heavy company. We wanted to change that. So we built out an advanced algorithmic trading platform with live open order books that allowed users to set their prices. This meant giving more control to our customers. They can now determine the spend and set their rates, and they make the market on Coinsecure.  Also, our API allows anyone across the globe to plug in and start a white label exchange and leverage from the tech we’ve built out. India has demonetized its physical currency and removed high denomination rupees. How has this affected the average Indian citizen? BS: While demonetization could be good, it should have been better organized and implemented. The common man and the lower class of society are the most affected, considering that India was a cash-heavy economy. Making a change from a cash-heavy economy to a cashless economy overnight definitely comes with a whole lot of challenges for banks as well as people alike.  Since the prime minister started the demonetization effort how has this affected bitcoin interest for your business at Coinsecure? BS: The move on demonetization has definitely spiked interest in Bitcoin in India overall. We are seeing over a 300% increase in turnover and over 250% increase in our user base.  India’s government seems to want to speed up a cashless society. Do you think bitcoin is favorable in the government’s view as a digital money? BS: The last document released by the Reserve Bank of India states that they aim to regulate cryptocurrencies by 2017.  India’s outlook towards bitcoin has definitely improved and now with the move of going cashless, I see a huge opportunity for India to look at bitcoin as one of the best options. I believe that India will definitely look at regulating bitcoin and setting practices to be followed shortly.  Media has been reporting stories about gold confiscation taking place in India. How truthful are these headlines?  BS: Most of these stories are around illegal hoardings, and these raids seems more a routine that is followed from time to time.  The Coinsecure team has recently released its live order app can you tell our readers about this? BS: Yes, our Android app allows users to trade (buy/sell) on the go. The exchange app is packed with features and is the first to have live open order books. Can you tell us about your recent partnership with Bitpay and what this collaboration entails?   BS: Our partnership with Bitpay means that businesses in India can now accept Bitcoin as a method of payment with a 0% volatility risk. This eliminates the risk of losing money and also allows merchants and businesses to open out their markets to the global audience.  How does your company feel about the current state of Bitcoin development and the growing ecosystem?  BS: Just like the dot-com bubble distracted development of the core internet, we are seeing the blockchain bubble distracting the core, which is bitcoin. The bubble is bound to pass, and we will see bitcoin gaining popularity.  What is Coinsecure’s overall mission?  BS: We started Coinsecure with the mission of “Connecting India to Bitcoin.” Coinsecure currently focusses on building an entire ecosystem for all bitcoin and blockchain related needs. This simply means that we are aiming to be the one-stop shop for all bitcoin and blockchain related needs by building out an array of products and services. Thank you, Benson, for sharing your insights on what is happening in India and how your company is serving the population digital asset alternatives. Good luck with all your endeavors.

Numerai founder Richard Craib told Wired that one hundred scientists have been paid for their services in bitcoin. According to the company $150,000 USD worth of bitcoins has been dispersed to data scientists for their work. Additionally, data from the researchers are gathered within a leaderboard collecting intelligence to create a collaborative powered prediction model.        “No data scientist on Numerai has a machine learning model that is better than all the other models combined,” explains Numerai’s Medium blog. “So Numerai is not a search for the ‘best’ model; it is a platform to synthesize many different models with many different characteristics. Although data scientists compete to place on the leaderboard, the competition is designed to collect models. Numerai is not really a competition; it’s an invisible collaboration to build the meta model.” Prediction markets and cryptocurrency solutions are believed to have a significant effect on the future of markets. While Numerai pays its staff in bitcoins for building machine learning data models, there are other cryptocurrency powered prediction platforms coming. For instance, two well-known projects in this field are Bitcoin Hivemind and the Augur prediction market.  Hivemind (or Truthcoin) is a peer-to-peer oracle system and prediction marketplace developed by Paul Sztorc. The project aims to allow prediction market participants to buy and sell shares speculating on selected worldwide events. Sztorc’s model is tethered to the Bitcoin network, and the founder believes prediction systems will be far more effective than traditional markets today. The Hivemind founder told us back in January: Another project called Augur is a decentralized prediction platform built on Ethereum. Augur also uses collective data to formulate forecasts on upcoming events. The project uses game theory, and cryptocurrency incentives to better enhance the intelligence. Theoretically, as the platform becomes popularized predictions concerning any worldwide events become more accurate. Augur was designed by Joey Krug, Tony Sakich, Jack Peterson and is currently still in beta. The project expects to its live release at some point in 2017, and the platform’s native token REP is already being traded. Numerai and the many analytical data and prediction market projects might be game changers within the global economy. Furthermore, voluntary data collection seems more favorable than entities scraping data without permission. According to Numerai’s founder machine learning and portfolio management combined can procure lower error rates and higher returns.        “We are building the largest ensemble of stock market machine learning models in the world,” Craib said.

2016-12-13T06:00:11-04:00,The Bitcoin Network Death That Never Happened (Again),Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-network-death-never/,"A popular Linkedin post that was written on December 8 claimed the end of the Bitcoin network was coming. In fact, the post that has since been deleted was supposedly created by ‘MIT fintech alumni’ and stated a significant “stress test” was coming to attack the Bitcoin blockchain on Monday, December 12. However, the editorial seems to be a hoax, as nothing emerged from the creators of Forcecoin. Monday, December 12 was supposed to be doomsday for the cryptocurrency bitcoin, according to a recently deleted Linkedin story. When the article was published, its author made sure it was seen across various social media platforms such as Reddit. The report classified Bitcoin as a “tulip” craze and stated that it was a “fundamentally flawed virtual currency.” According to the author a series of “global automated tests” were set to spam the Bitcoin network and show the world the digital asset “cannot be used as a store of wealth.” “It’s time for it to make way for a better designed, more compliant, and more secure system as a global digital currency,” explained the so-called creators of Forcecoin.  Just as the December 12 attack never materialized, the team’s website URL also was an unclaimed domain according to Godaddy. Furthermore, the article in question was deleted but saved via archive.is. Going through the post shows the author was either purposely hoaxing the Bitcoin community or didn’t understand the protocol at all. For instance, the article invited hackers from all around the world to steal the Forcecoin code similar to when the Mt Gox code was leaked. Yet this past exchange code leak had nothing to do with the Bitcoin network itself and is a meaningless argument. The article states if hackers “succeed at breaking into Salesforce and stealing ForceCoin code – we, as the Salesforce MIT ForceCoin.org team, will concede defeat and acknowledge Bitcoin as the winner.” According to Bitcoin Obituaries the digital asset has died 117 times, according to the many mainstream media reports. The Linkedin article titled “Bitcoin is a bubble. It will burst on Monday 12 December 2016” is now recorded as the last bitcoin death. Other overly exaggerated bitcoin deaths come from publications such as Bloomberg, Newsweek, the Wall Street Journal and much more. Many deaths supposedly occurred after Mt Gox, when Mike Hearn left, and when Bitfinex was breached.  Most cryptocurrency enthusiasts easily dismiss these headlines of bitcoin bursting at the seams. The Linkedin post/hoax was no different as even if it was true, the points made were quite illogical. However mainstream media and those who don’t know much about bitcoin can easily be swayed by such headlines. Think about how many of your friends say, “Oh I thought bitcoin had died.”  The alleged team behind Forcecoin doesn’t seem to exist, and the December 12 bubble pop or stress test never came. In fact climbed to a high of $779 beating out this year’s price high and the highest value bitcoin has been in three years.  What did you think about the Forcecoin hoax? Or the many so-called “Bitcoin deaths” that have transpired since the cryptocurrency’s inception? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Bitcoin.com, and Pixabay. Bitcoin is cool, and you know everyone wants in – even the ones who say they don’t.

2016-12-12T15:00:04-04:00,U.S. Bitcoin Options Since Circle’s Departure,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/us-bitcoin-circle-departure/,"Now that Circle Internet Financial has stopped servicing cryptocurrency buys and sells, Americans have one less option than before. However, there are still various ways U.S. citizens can purchase and sell bitcoins. Here’s a look at a few options U.S. residents can use to acquire bitcoin. Also read: Bitcoin 2016: the Year of a Different Rise The Circle platform served the UK and other areas, but the lion’s share of its customers were from the U.S. Since the company’s departure from bitcoin brokerage services, many U.S. residents asked about other options available to purchase and sell across the United States. During Circle’s business pivot away from bitcoin purchases and sales the company recommended its partner Coinbase. The San Francisco-based startup, founded in 2012 by Brian Armstrong and Fred Ehrsam, is probably the most well-known bitcoin broker. Cryptocurrency users can purchase and sell digital assets such as bitcoin and ether with the Coinbase platform through credit card or bank transfer.  Registrants who initially sign up for Coinbase have to verify their identity with documents like a license. They will also need to validate a phone number and tether the account to the two-factor application Authy. After a customer is verified on the first tier buying and selling options becomes available for the client. Limits can be raised after some time and a touch more identity verification is processed.  Coinbase has various fees for purchasing and selling digital assets that consumers need to research before using the platform. Furthermore, the company does enable users to obtain private keys, works as a general wallet, and also features a vault service. The vault is a wallet that creates a second layer of security for bitcoins held on the Coinbase platform. Coinbase is one of the first brokerage services that continues to remain a leader in the bitcoin industry.  Localbitcoins volumes over the past year have skyrocketed across the globe. The platform is another method U.S. citizens can utilize to purchase and sell bitcoins. A lot of people think that you have to meet people in person to use Localbitcoins, but trades can be done online as well. Localbitcoins also probably has the most payment options available to purchase and sell your digital assets. This included bank cash deposits, Paypal, gift cards, Vanilla, credit cards and many more payment options to choose from.  Users of Localbitcoins can opt to trade online or in person depending on how comfortable they are with the process. Localbitcoins trader prices are typically higher than global exchange rates for purchasing and lower for selling. Registrants use a positive feedback reputation system, and optional identity verification is available. Users also use LocalBitcoins wallet as a form of escrow to conduct official trades.  Bitquick is a cryptocurrency exchange that operates similarly to LocalBitcoins but has only one payment method bank cash deposits. Bitquick was founded by Jad Mubaslat in 2013, but was recently acquired by the bitcoin atm company Athena Bitcoin. There really isn’t a verification process unless a user is trading large amounts of bitcoins, and it’s up to BitQuicks discretion.  Like Localbitcoins, users deposit funds into Bitquick’s escrow wallet and then either puts a deal on hold or creates a trade. Consumers conducting a trade to purchase bitcoins deposit cash into one of the membership banks and the seller’s release the funds when paid. There is a few hour window of availability when trading and cancels if the trade isn’t finalized at the end of the time limit. Bitquick prices seem much lower in comparison to Localbitcoins, but there isn’t as many trades available or different payment methods.  There is an assortment of smaller platforms that offer purchasing and selling bitcoins not mentioned above. Some of them are very new, and some have very limited customer service or options. In addition to the services noted above, U.S. crypto-enthusiasts can acquire BTC by using an exchange such as Bitstamp, Gemini, and GDAX. If a Coinbase user has been validated to obtain a USD wallet, they also are verified to register for the GDAX exchange. Furthermore, Bitsquare.io is a decentralized exchange that offers purchasing and selling bitcoins as well.  Bitcoin.com has a wide variety of exchanges to choose from within our recommended exchange section. Many available exchanges that cater to U.S. citizens are listed such as Coinsbank, BitX, Bitfinex, Simplex, Itbit and more. Additionally, we have a platform that enables bitcoin purchase with a valid credit card. Visitors can use their credit card to buy bitcoins, safely and quickly in a very short period of time. Moreover, investors can also purchase bitcoins across the U.S. utilizing cryptocurrency ATMs located in many states. Coinatmradar is a website to find out where these bitcoin ATMs reside and info on each one. The website explains what kind of ATM is being used, the address, and whether or not they are two-way or one-way machines. Bitcoin ATMs depending on the device typically requires no identification.  With Circle leaving the industry, there are still many choices for Americans to obtain bitcoin. Each option has differences that are appealing such as convenience, payment methods, identity validation or services that don’t require an ID. In time, new companies will arise that offer the selling and buying of bitcoin in many ways. Are there any U.S. buying and selling services you’d like to mention? Let us know about them in the comments below. Images courtesy of Shutterstock, Coinbase, Bitquick, and Localbitcoins websites. Have you seen our new widget service?

2016-12-12T06:00:38-04:00,How to Build Your Own Bitcoin Exchange,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/build-exchange-bitcoin-adoption/,"Bitcoin exchanges play a vital role in promoting the cryptocurrency by facilitating its use. Most bitcoin users perform their transactions through an exchange. However, bitcoin is not yet mainstream. So far, only a narrow segment of the population, mainly innovators, technology enthusiasts, and visionaries, have adopted bitcoin. Expanding the number of exchanges would help overcome resistance to the cryptocurrency’s adoption by increasing its visibility. Also read: Insurance Coverage For Bitcoin Exchanges Against Cyber Attacks Several factors slow the spreading of a new idea or product. One of them is resistance to change. By nature, most people are resistant to change. Bitcoin and its blockchain technology bring change — dramatic change. Indeed, these novel technologies are bringing our civilization to the outset of a far-reaching technological revolution. Consequently, the resulting changes will be pervasive, all encompassing, and irreversible. In addition to other strategies, communicating more effectively about the virtues of bitcoin and creating more user-friendly exchanges, would help overcome resistance to change and increase the rate of adoption. As an example, take one of the problems impeding electric vehicle adoption: Lack of infrastructure. “If you want people to run electric cars in the city and suburbs, there will have to be many more charging stations,” says Eric Schaal. Likewise, if you want more bitcoin users, there will have to be many more exchanges. A bitcoin exchange is a site that facilitates trading bitcoins for fiat currencies or other digital currencies, and vice versa. Bitcoin exchanges also provide you with the service of storing your bitcoins. When selecting an exchange, consider security as one of the primary attributes. You should also verify how user-friendly the exchange is and what payment options it offers you (cards, Paypal, cash, and bank transfer). Moreover, you must make sure the exchange is available in your country. The level of regulation pertaining to bitcoin exchanges varies from country to country. In Japan, for example, exchanges have to register with Japan’s financial regulator. In Argentina bitcoins are unregulated, but “transactions with bitcoins may be governed by the rules of the sale of goods under the Civil Code,” according to the Library of Congress. Another point to consider is the degree of decentralization of the exchange. In the U.S., a court recently forced Coinbase to hand over user data to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). In effect, Coinbase informed its users that the “U.S. government filed a civil petition yesterday in federal court seeking disclosure of all Coinbase U.S. customers’ records over a three year period. The government has not alleged any wrongdoing on the part of Coinbase and its petition is predicated on sweeping statements that taxpayers may use virtual currency to evade taxes.” On the other hand, Bitsquare claims to be a decentralized exchange.  “Bitsquare is an open-source desktop application that allows you to buy and sell bitcoins in exchange for national currencies or alternative cryptocurrencies.” Bitsquare also claims, “The system is peer-to-peer, and trading cannot be stopped or censored.” A useful resource for checking and comparing various Bitcoin exchanges available in the market is BestBitcoinExchange. If you have an entrepreneurial mindset and wish to join a massive technological revolution, you can build your own local Bitcoin exchange. You can build one even if you are not too technically savvy and have limited capital to invest in software and infrastructure. Software packages are entering the market to help you set up your Bitcoin trading platform. For example, BTCTrader offers a fully branded, customized, and managed white-label service that offers you the ability to “start your local bitcoin exchange in 45 days.” “This software solution is for entrepreneurs looking to own and run a Bitcoin exchange in their market without having to invest in software and infrastructure. The platform comes equipped with liquidity ‘in-hand’ meaning that partners’ exchanges have access to a full order book from the moment their site goes live. BTCTrader is responsible for the regular deployment of new platform features, updates and also the safety of all bitcoin balances,” says Alphan Gogus, CFO at BTCTrader. Alphapoint is another company offering “blockchain-enabled solutions to store, track, and trade digital assets. Its secure, scalable, and customizable platform enables customers to deploy blockchain technology to innovate, differentiate, and transform their businesses.” “Customize and launch your own digital asset exchange in less than 20 days with AlphaPoint,” promises Alphapoint’s website. Resistance to adopting bitcoin is diminishing. Indeed, bitcoin is achieving momentum, as shown by its price increases and the higher daily volumes that it has achieved in the last few months. More exchanges would certainly add to its momentum by increasing the mainstream adoption of bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology. Do you think having more exchanges will help accelerate bitcoin’s rate of adoption? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-11T19:00:00-04:00,Live Video Site Otika.tv Ensures Your Privacy with Bitcoin,Bitcoin.com,https://news.bitcoin.com/otika-tv-ensures-privacy-bitcoin/,"Bitcoin’s properties are inspiring new business models. One unique concept is Otika.tv, a startup that has given the world a new video streaming platform that ensures your privacy is intact. By integrating with bitcoin (and shunning credit cards), Otika.tv allows broadcasters to share content and get rewarded with satoshis (small bits of bitcoin) by viewers. The video streaming outfit aims to provide enhanced security, lowered processing cost, and better privacy, which is lacking with some other mainstream content distributors. Bitcoin.com spoke to John Carvalho, CCO of Otika.tv. Also read: Cryptocurrency Hedge Fund Polychain Raises $10 Million Bitcoin.com (BC): Could you explain what Otika.tv is all about? John Carvalho (JC): Otika.tv is a new platform for live video-streaming. The website allows broadcasters to set “goals” and receive bitcoin tips from viewers to fill those goals. The website is currently in the beta stage of development, but all of the current features work reliably. BC: What is so unique about your business model? JC: Our project allows our users to have a much higher degree of privacy and control of their money due to the integration of bitcoin. Otika.tv does not store any personal or financial information of our users. We also utilize a cold storage wallet, minimizing the risk involved with storing bitcoins with us. That means that if we were to be hacked, our users would not have to worry about exposing their personal identities or financial info, unlike services like Twitch.tv or YouTube. Another unique aspect to Otika.tv is that we do not limit the categories of content our users can stream. We will allow anything that is legal and suitable for all ages (Note that we also offer an adult-only version of the website, at Xotika.tv). This differs from services like Twitch, Hitbox, and Beam, which limit broadcasts to game-related content. We encourage broadcasters to stream things like local Bitcoin meetups, conference presentations, cooking shows, and more! BC: As a company how do you get your revenue? JC: Our revenue is generated as a percentage of all tips or payments made to broadcasters. We will be introducing a badge and reward system that will allow popular streamers to increase the percentage they receive as they grow in success. BC: So far how is patronage? JC: The site is very new; we are always asking for feedback from our users and learning about what changes they would like to see implemented. So far, the users that are comfortable with bitcoin already love the site, but the users that are new to bitcoin and used to Twitch want to see all of the same features they are accustomed to. Their feedback has helped us decide what features to add in 2017 when we will officially go live with a new version of the website. BC: Where do you see Otika.tv in five years? JC: I expect to see Otika.tv as a major competitor in the video-streaming space. I believe that being bitcoin-only and operating as a lean business is already giving us cost advantages and we are well-positioned for the future. Our competitors will never be able to sever themselves from their fiat connections and credit card processors, and thus they will never have the ability to provide their users with the same level of privacy, nor the same level of control over their money. In less than five years, we’ll have all the features our users could want, as well as innovative new features that allow improved streaming, security, and interaction between broadcasters and viewers. BC: Why did you choose bitcoin as the form of reward? JC: We chose bitcoin for the independence and security it provides to our users and us. We don’t need a bank account. We don’t need to pay processing fees. We don’t need to know who you are. We don’t need to know your bank info. You don’t need to trust us with more than your tip balance. You don’t need to wait to withdraw your tips. You can focus on creating and viewing great content, and we can focus on building great features and communities! Thank you, John, for telling us about the Otika.tv platform. What do you think about Otika.tv? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-11T15:00:56-04:00,Giving the Gift of Bitcoin This Holiday Season,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/giving-gift-bitcoin-holiday-season/,"The season of giving is here, and there’s no better way to spread the incredible benefits of cryptocurrency by giving our loved ones bitcoins. Giving bitcoin to family and friends will help spread adoption and can also be a pretty unique gift. This holiday season bitcoiners can relax about thinking of gift ideas for their friends and family. The gift of bitcoin gives people an idea of what it’s like to have ultimate control over their wealth, the vision of the future of money, and ultimately funds they can spend on whatever they want. Here are a few clever ideas to give people bitcoin this year for the holidays. Also read: Enjoy the Holidays with This 2016 Bitcoin Gift Guide Paper wallets are a great way to give people bitcoin just like physical cash. People can create their own paper wallet design or use a company like bitcoinpaperwallet.com. Currently, the service has holiday designs with a private key under a tamper evident hologram. And of course, paper wallets can be made without a holiday design and loaded with BTC prior to giving to friends. Furthermore, Bitcoin.com has our very own paper wallet creator where users can generate their own address. Paper wallets have great benefits and a couple of drawbacks as well. Make sure you tell people to keep their paper wallets safe as they can be destroyed just like cash.  There are plenty of services that will allow you to gift people bitcoin through an email. However, another way you can gift bitcoin online is with an e-card service. One service called BitGreet offers Christmas e-cards with bitcoin. Users choose from a variety of designs, and people attach a denomination of BTC to the card. The service is powered by the Isle of Man bitcoin exchange CoinCorner. The free service founded in 2013 says “the only thing you have to worry about is which card to pick!”  Physical bitcoins is another unique way to give cryptocurrency. There a few different coins you can buy pre-loaded, or you can load yourself. Casascius physical Bitcoins are a fan favorite among the community, and sometimes you can even purchase older versions on eBay. Or one could choose some of the fine designs by the Finland-based Denarium. Currently, Denarium is offering holiday deals, and the company accepts multiple cryptocurrencies for its physical products. Another great idea is to give someone a hardware wallet. Of course, they will have to set it up, and you can send them some cryptocurrency to a secure device like Trezor, Ledger or a KeepKey. If you want to give a hardware bearer bond instrument then maybe an OpenDime would be an option. Or maybe while your Aunts and Uncles are getting saucy by the tree you tell your cousins about Bitcoin and have them download a wallet app to their smartphone. Whether they have an Android or an iOS phone, there are multiple wallets they can download. Then simply send them a few satoshis during the holiday cheer. Giving bitcoins is an excellent way to educate friends and family about the peer-to-peer cryptocurrency. The holiday season is a perfect way to open the doors bitcoin innovation to the ones you love. What kind of methods would you use to gift bitcoins during the holiday season? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-10T12:00:04-04:00,Bitcoin 2016: the Year of a Different Rise,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-2016-year-different-rise/,"It was like yesterday when it happened — the bitcoin price shot up and broke the spot price of gold. Jumping in the air, I couldn’t believe it; the news was like no other. Every news outlet in the world reported how the price of the digital currency rose an incredible 78-fold during 2013. Also read: Bitcoin’s Price Teasing Towards New Highs It’s been three solid years since this time, and we are still trucking on. During that time when the price was over USD $1,000 a coin, many companies like Mt. Gox were still doing business. Earlier in April the price had rallied to $266 with the small country of Cyprus in fear of bank runs and economic failure. The price then took a steady dive after the European Union swept the crisis under the rug and smashed to a floor of $50 a coin. In October the currency had yet another revival, and this one would peak like never before. Trading at roughly a hundred dollars and hearing about Subway owners accepting the currency, enthusiasm was rampant. Volume was surging in China, and rumors of the PBOC restricting use of virtual money were starting to spread. About a month earlier the Silk Road was taken down, and the currency wasn’t viewed in a positive light. Following this, governments all around the world started looking into bitcoin. In the U.S., a Senate committee dedicated to focusing on cryptocurrency was assembled to create a regulatory discussion. On November 18, the bitcoin price soared again to record highs of $680 a coin, and it was clear the rockets were blazing.  Forbes magazine called 2013 “The Year Of Bitcoin” and everyone’s favorite decentralized currency started raising eyebrows. Mt Gox at the time was the most popular trading engine on the market and was swapping bitcoins at an exponential rate. At the time, this was looked at as a natural phenomenon. However, over the course of the next few months, with the demise of Mt Gox and their insolvency, reports of bots trading the coins became prevalent.  I hold the moments when bitcoin had overtaken the price of silver and gold as very strong memories. 2013 was nearing a five-year run with the global economic recession, and unemployment was at high levels. Forecasters from the likes of Gerald Celente and others predicted impending financial doom worldwide, and countries like Greece looked to be faltering. When the bitcoin price shot through the roof during the fall months, many innovations were happening, and infrastructure was built. Andreessen Horowitz and accredited investors showed the world that venture capitalists were funding this architecture. In November, while everyone had their eyes on the price tickers, the New York Department of Financial Services initiated plans for a BitLicense. Despite this immense upward swing in price and infrastructure soon after the price cracked slowly dwindling downwards. Times have changed since the rally of 2013, a memory a lot of enthusiasts share. Mt Gox is deceased, and 2014 was called bitcoin’s worst year. Fast forward to now and the story has once again experienced a revival. Bitcoin had a solid 2015, staying stable in price all year long and resting at a rough $200 average most of the year. This 2016 fall season has seen yet another price spike and a keen interest in the technology behind Bitcoin. The blockchain concept has intrigued banks from all around the world. During 2015 significant interest grew into looking at the digital currency’s underlying technology. Most legacy institutions have been bolstering the ‘private ledger’ over the public cryptocurrency bitcoin. Bitcoin has been trading at roughly $760 a coin for the past couple of days after a high of $778 a week or so before. The digital currency has some more hurdles to face as political pundits are clamoring against encryption and digital currency’s use, in the name of protectionism. The recent rally has sparked revived enthusiasm, and people look for all the positive headlines.  It’s not like the fall run of 2013, and the vibe is more mellow. The community is robust, and we know exciting times are continually happening. These times are just as powerful because we are making global headway and encryption and digital currency scares the central authorities. The question is if 2013 was the year of Bitcoin and 2014 was its worst year, what will we call 2016? What would you call 2016? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-09T16:00:38-04:00,Following Demonetization India Is Changing Its Outlook On Bitcoin,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/india-changing-outlook-bitcoin/,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s demonetization of 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes has thrown India’s economy and financial systems into turmoil. Local residents now struggle to obtain cash to support and finance their day-to-day living.  The government’s restriction on gold importation is also affecting the general population, as 78% of Indian households store their wealth in gold. As a result, an increasing number of investors, traders and households are seeking for safe haven assets like bitcoin. In the aftermath of the demonetization of 500 and 1,000 bank notes that shocked the Indian economy, the Indian government effectively imposed tight regulations on gold importation and confiscation, raiding households and villages to forcefully seize jewelry. Also read: The Jio Network May Boost India’s Bitcoin Economy Indiatoday, a local publication based in Nodia, confirmed with a senior IT official that raids have taken place in large cities such as Delhi and Mumbai to seize gold and jewelries. The official also told Indiatoday that jewelers are targeted by the authorities as they may trade their gold in the Indian black market. As the demonetization of the two banknotes and restriction on gold trading begun to severely affect the Indian economy, Prime Minister Modi laid out some short-term strategies to offer higher liquidity for cash users. On December 9 for instance, Modi promised 100,000 villages two electronic payment machines per village, in an attempt to resolve the shortage of cash. Despite the attempts of the government to mitigate the damage caused by its recent capital control regimes and demonetization, Indian households, businesses and investors have begun to move on to other assets that could protect their wealth from tightening financial regulations. With gold being targeted by the authorities, a large number of traders have started to purchase silver to eliminate any possibility of their storage of gold being targeted by the local authorities. As a result, the demand for silver significantly increased over the past few weeks. Fergal O’Connor, a senior lecturer in Finance at the University of York, stated that a 10% reallocation from gold jewelry investment to silver could double world silver demand, which could cause a drastic change in the silver market. Apart from silver, a fairly large number of investors and people have shifted their focus towards bitcoin. The mainstream Indian press and media have started to report on the rising demand for bitcoin and its advantages over physical assets like gold or silver. In a recent edition of the Economic Times newspaper, analysts Shailesh Menon and Saikat Das noted that the demand for bitcoin amongst local users is surging on bitcoin exchanges like Zebpay, as investors and users purchase bitcoin at a premium price in the range of US$850 to $1030. Sahil Sha, an 18-year-old university student who was interviewed by the Economic Times, stated, “The demonetization announcement stoked the rally and presented a good selling opportunity.” Sha also stated that him and other traders recently sold bitcoin at a 42,000 rupee profit, which is equivalent to $622. The rising demand for bitcoin is also evident on peer to peer and over-the-counter markets like LocalBitcoins, which have experienced a substantial increase in trading volumes over the past month. In the beginning of November, the weekly trading volume of bitcoin was estimated to be $165,000. In late November and December, the weekly trading volume on LocalBitcoins India reached $408,000, demonstrating a 2.5x increase in trading volumes. Menon and Das, the two analysts at Economic Times India, also emphasized that Zebpay and other leading Indian exchanges have significantly increased the trading price of bitcoin in several parts of India that have higher demands. Because of the initiatives of local exchanges maintain a tight order book, there are substantial differences in the buying and selling prices of LocalBitcoins and local bitcoin exchanges. On Average, LocalBitcoins users sell and purchase bitcoin at around $850, at a $100 premium to global bitcoin exchanges. However, exchanges like Zebpay show a price range of $980~$1030, which could attribute to the rapid increase in the weekly trading volumes of LocalBitcoins. “In order to maintain a tight order book, exchanges increase the bitcoin price when there is high demand. Post demonetization, exchanges like Zebpay have raised prices marginally to quieten demand,” said Das.

2016-12-09T12:00:04-04:00,"Forget QR Codes, NFC Bitcoin Wallet Cards Are Here",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/nfc-bitcoin-wallet-cards/,"The Bitcoin-based hardware and software manufacturer General Bytes has developed an NFC bitcoin wallet that hopes to replace the 22-year old QR code. The card allows users to transact with compatible point of sale (POS) terminals, allowing anyone to pay with bitcoin. Also read: Bitstamp Tries the Crowdfunding Route at $60 Million Valuation General Bytes is a cryptocurrency startup founded in 2013 that sells bitcoin automated teller machines and other blockchain-based products. The company, headquartered in Prague, Czech Republic, was the first to implement near field communication (NFC) technology into their devices. Now the firm is taking it a step further by developing a machine that dispenses NFC wallet cards that can be loaded with bitcoins. According to Martijn Wismeijer, marketing manager at General Bytes, QR codes are gradually being replaced by Bluetooth and NFC tag technology. Wismeijer told Bitcoin.com the newly developed NFC wallet card system simplifies the user experience when transacting with bitcoin.  The company’s BATMThree XXL plus model dispenses the wallet cards and is the first ATM in the industry with this type of functionality. The idea stemmed from the biohacking community that already uses NFC designed bitcoin wallet implants. However, the company realizes not everyone wants to get an implant, and General Bytes believes the cards are the next best thing. “The idea is to work together with the Bitcoin community and build from there as it was the biohacking community that inspired us to use NFC in the first place.” Wismeijer said. To build the NFC wallet products, the startup had to implement certain architecture such as the WIF (Wallet Import Format). This integration allows storage of bitcoin keys on the card’s NFC chip. The company has also tested the cards with the CortexPay POS terminal that was launched in 2015. CortexPay terminals have been widely used by visitors of Paralelni Polis in Prague and General Bytes says the system is quite reliable. Using the BATMThree XXL+, all the user has to do is purchase a wallet card via the machine’s interface. While the device manufactures the card, bitcoin keys are written into the NFC compatible wallet card. NFC chip cards are not programmed until the sale is finalized with the end user. Cards are all black but can be designed to be printed in full color, and branded cards can be pre-loaded by the ATM operator as well. General Bytes believes the NFC wallet cards are important for the future of cryptocurrency. The company says cards takes the annoyance of fiddling with your phone out of the equation. The team believes the cards are ideal for day-to-day payments, petty cash, and storage. If the card is not used at a POS device, it can be used as a physical savings account as well. Currently, the BATMThree XXL+ model is available for those interested in operating a bitcoin ATM. Additionally, the startup’s hardware and software is open source via GitHub. General Bytes is pleased to offer this new type of product and hopes QR codes become a thing of the past.

2016-12-08T19:00:14-04:00,Permissionless Bitcoin Creates Job Opportunities for Ex-Offenders,Kei K,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-job-opportunities-ex-offenders/,"Ex-offenders often face tremendous social and financial challenges after their incarceration. However, bitcoin can offer them new ways to reintegrate back into society. Also read: Mainstreet Investment: A New Venture for Post-Prison Charlie Shrem The stigma of a criminal record often jeopardizes ex-offenders’ job opportunities — and may even deny them bank accounts, due to eligibility requirements. The number of unemployed ex-offenders will increase as more inmates qualify for early release. Often, employers are quick to reject job applications from them before an interview. However there are vast areas of opportunity in bitcoin which can offer the ex-offenders a second chance in employment, as well as a ‘banking wallet’. According to latest data available, there are approximately 1.8 million working-age ex-offenders in the U.S., with the majority of them unemployed. This number translates to a loss of about $78 to $87 billion in annual GDP to the country’s economy. This demonstrates how much the inability to reenter the workforce impacts ex-offenders’ lives, and also the economy as a whole. Add in the cost of running correction facilities, and prisons are crippling the economy in other ways too. There’s also another problem, even for the fortunate ex-offenders who find jobs — needing to receive salaries in physical cash. This is becoming increasingly difficult as physical money disappears. It further deters companies from hiring ex-offenders, to avoid the hassle of payroll departments having to set aside cash. Hence, hunting for a job without a bank account can be a catch-22. As employment is a critical factor in reducing recidivism, helping ex-offenders in getting a job is an important factor for society and economic wellbeing. Unlike big banks and organisations, bitcoin wallets offer free digital financial capabilities to anyone. Also, bitcoin neutrality offers ex-offenders “bank accounts” without the need to declare any of their personal records. Increasing use of bitcoin salary payment services like BitWage at a growing number of organisations creates opportunities for employment without a bank account. The government has plans and incentives, such as the Second Chance Act (SCA), to assist ex-offenders in re-entering working society. However, these are not sufficient as such initiatives require organisation’s willingness to put their measures into practice to be effective. According to the ‘Felon Friendly Jobs’ website, employers feel that ex-offenders pose a threat to the other employees or are capable of causing other trouble. Most ex-offenders would try their luck with companies that embrace the above-mentioned initiatives. A small number of them look for loans, i.e. the Federal Pell Grant, in hope to start their own business. Nonetheless, getting approval for these grants is still considerably difficult. Discrimination and low self-esteem are strong forces that push away ex-offenders from persisting in their job hunt, especially after multiple rejections. However, the growing presence of online industries leveraging bitcoin can offer a second chance and more — a job, a ‘banking wallet’, and a hideout from the discriminatory public by working from home. Not all ex-offenders are seeking for a hideout. Charlie Shrem, bitcoin entrepreneur and an ex-offender, has faced the media. Recently he announced the launch of a new company called “Intellisys Capital”. In an interview, he said:  These are the white collar offenders who would likely lose their positions in conventional society after their incarceration. Plus, these are the ones with the capabilities to contribute to society in big ways. Henceforth, the ‘P2P banking system’ removes banking obstacles that ex-offenders face. It gives them an alternative avenue to continue contributing their strengths to various industries. Apart from P2P banking system, the ‘P2P freelance employers’ that leverage on platforms that use bitcoin can offer the ex-offenders yet another method to earn themselves a living. To wrap up, the invention of bitcoin has shed some lights to organisations and the public on how to cross the conventional hurdles and problems that the society faces. From the inability of opening a bank account, near-zero job prospects, and the social stigma that comes together with a criminal record, bitcoin has not fallen short of worthy contributions to the society and economy.

2016-12-08T17:31:40-04:00,Circle Still Using Bitcoin ‘Behind the Scenes’,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/circle-still-bitcoin-scenes/,"Bitcoiners were maddened when former Bitcoin Core developer Mike Hearn quit the cryptocurrency’s community. They alleged Mr. Hearn “rage quit” after he agreed to an interview with New York Times and penned a Medium post about why he was divesting from Bitcoin.  Also read: Bitstamp Tries the Crowdfunding Route at $60 Million Valuation Now, Circle Internet Financial has publicly bemoaned Bitcoin developers, placing blame on their shoulders for Circle’s lack of success in the space. Mr. Hearn identified real problems within the Bitcoin ecosystem, touching on its lack of governance model and the infighting to which this has led. He moved onto greener pastures at R3. These same issues have bubbled to the surface yet again.  Circle, the payments startup which boasts founders from Wall Street, has now also “rage quit”, blaming the cryptocurrency’s developers for Circle’s suspension of bitcoin trades — while still using bitcoin internally!  The issue lies not with Bitcoin and its present iteration, although there are big issues to be sorted through and learned from, but with the fact that some bitcoin service providers are redundant. Circle, apparently, for one.  Bitcoin, a payment system, and token, needs not a third party provider to do what it already can do: transfer value. Users are doing this without problem for less expensive still than other providers. They might not be doing it at quite the scale as Circle, but they might be less monied users who thus benefit from the technology more than Wall Street alums.  Circle not only was one of the best funded digital currency firms but represented one of the first Bitcoin organizations to boast Wall Street talent. The company announced the move away from Bitcoin on Wednesday, and Wall Street took the occasion to call it “the latest indication that the financial revolution that bitcoin’s early developers had hoped to spark isn’t playing out as planned.” A statement which, ironically, is merely the latest indication that WSJ understands jack about Bitcoin.  Bitcoin’s early developers thought it was a good idea, but good for financial domination is a line of reasoning that’s mostly relegated to the marketing materials of myriad third-party bitcoin services, many of which are bloated and redundant, as well as Reddit and other social forums where people chat…anonymously. According to WSJ, Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire said, “bitcoin hasn’t evolved quickly enough to support everyday financial activities.” He levied complaints at Bitcoin’s developers.  “The story is one of essentially gridlock amongst core developers, while mainstream companies are using this technology,” Allaire said of Bitcoin. “We’ve been deeply frustrated with that lack of progress, and we want to move it forward.”  Allaire’s statement is essentially the same as blaming Bram Cohen for not perfecting BitTorrent for enterprise. Or Charlie Lee for not taking his job with Coinbase instead of developing Litecoin (or marketing it) to take the burden of micro-transactions of the bitcoin’s block size’s shoulders. Allaire’s main problem is that he oversaw Circle’s over-leveraging of itself in bitcoin.  A cursory search on Google reveals no donations by Circle to Bitcoin developers, but $136 million being invested into Allaire’s startup by financial and tech powerhouses.  Notably, Circle suspended payments after the Internal Revenue Service sent a John Doe summons to Coinbase for two years of user records. Coinbase, not charged with doing anything wrong, scoffed at the request and posted on its blog it would fight the “government’s sweeping request.”  The headlines imply Circle is totally getting out of the Bitcoin industry. But, that’s misleading. Allaire says Circle remains committed to using blockchain for cross-border payments. The company plans to continue using bitcoin and other digital tokens internally, also, and Coinbase agreed to partner with Circle so the company’s customers can still buy and sell bitcoin.  Why not keep one foot in the Bitcoin industry? After all, WSJ writes, Circle’s bitcoin volume grew 50% a year. And the gains they made just by holding bitcoin since the the summer of 2015 alone? Nearly 300%. What do you think about Circle changing its business model? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-08T12:00:15-04:00,New FCA Rules Could Reduce UK Bitcoin Spread Betting Appeal,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/uk-fca-rules-bitcoin-spread-betting/,"The UK Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has proposed stricter rules for Contract for Difference (CFD) products which include financial spread betting. While illegal in the US, spread betting is legal in the UK. Bitcoin spread betting is available through some of the country’s largest CFD operators, such as IG Group. Also read: Europe Will Have Power to Ban Blockchain Tech in January 2018  Spread betting is a form of derivatives trading. It involves speculating on the direction of the price of a particular asset such as bitcoin without actually owning it. “If it [asset price] moves the way you predict, your profit will grow the further it goes. However, if the market moves against you, your loss will also increase as the price movement becomes greater,” explained IG Group, the UK’s largest spread betting operator. The popularity of spread betting is largely due to profits from this type of trades being exempt from UK capital gains tax, as well as stamp duty. IG Group noted: The FCA’s proposed rules stem from the outcome of its analysis of CFD firms’ client accounts. The agency found that 82% of clients lost money on these products and the average loss was £2,200 a year. “We have serious concerns that an increasing number of retail clients are trading in CFD products without an adequate understanding of the risks involved,” said Christopher Woolard, the FCA’s executive director of strategy and competition. This can result in “rapid, large and unexpected losses,” he added. The agency’s plans include capping leverage at a maximum level of 50:1 for all experienced retail clients and a maximum of 25:1 for inexperienced clients. According to the FCA, some platforms currently offer levels of leverage exceeding 200:1 to retail customers. In addition, the agency also proposed other measures such as standardized risk warnings to customers, requiring providers to disclose profit-loss ratios on client accounts, and preventing providers from offering any form of incentives for customers to trade CFD products. The FCA estimates that approximately 125,000 people in the UK have active spread betting accounts and a further 400,000 are based overseas. These accounts collectively hold about £3.5 billion in client money. According to IG Group, the agency’s proposals “do not appear to directly apply to firms operating from outside the UK.” IG Group, with 40 percent of the industry market share, began offering bitcoin spread betting in April 2013. The option quickly gained popularity because of the rapid rise of bitcoin price and subsequent crash days later. In fact, bitcoin spread betting became “one of the more popular specialist markets” IG has ever offered, attracting hundreds of trades each week, the company said at the time. “Instead of purchasing bitcoins you can speculate on their value as a forex pair or using a
digital 100 [binaries],” according to IG website. The platform currently offers XBT/USD, XBT/GBP, XBT/EUR, XBT/JPY, and XBT/CNH currency pairs “with spreads from $4 and 7.5% margin.” Plus500, another leading CFD operator in the UK, also offers bitcoin spread betting. Following the FCA’s announcement, shares of IG Group fell more than 30 percent while Plus500’s lost 25 percent. Citi analysts said this move threatened the spread-betting industry’s growth outlook. “This has taken us by surprise — we were not expecting the FCA to propose leverage limits,” they said in a note. For now, the FCA is only targeting financial spread betting operating in the UK. Spread betting on sports is also regulated by the FCA but currently “it is not the focus of the regulator’s concerns,” BBC news reported. Overall, the financial spread betting industry lost more than £1 billion after the announcement. The FCA has asked for comments on its proposals by 7 March 2017.

The school will be the first German University to accept cryptocurrency as payment. Also read: Local Chinese Government Helps Fund Blockchain Startup ESMT Berlin is a leading business school in Germany that offers MBA accreditation, PhDs, and master’s degrees. The private university, located in Berlin, has been well established for 14 years. Now the school will be accepting bitcoin for all of its education programs. The university detailed that digital currencies offer money transfers without the need for third-party intermediaries. “Integrating bitcoin as a routine method of payment is a logical consequence of digitalization,” explains Georg Garlichs, CFO of ESMT. “Especially for international transactions from countries without a well-functioning banking system, the digital currency offers great advantages through the immediate, practically free-of-charge transfer. This makes bitcoins attractive to us as a means of accepted payment.” Germany has been quite keen towards researching and developing virtual currency and blockchain solutions. ESMT Berlin has a broad range of studies concerning blockchain innovation and what it means for business and society. Furthermore, a few other schools in Germany have been researching the blockchain subject as well such as Frankfurt School of Finance & Management. ESMT Berlin describes Bitcoin as the “most well-developed blockchain application.” “In addition to reducing transaction costs and providing P2P marketplaces, blockchain also facilitates individual marketing of personal data,” details Christoph Burger, blockchain expert at ESMT. “This is a feature that offers the data owner an improved position when negotiating with the users of data, especially in the age of big data.”  A few other universities worldwide also accept Bitcoin for services for tuition and supplies. The largest school in Cyprus the University of Nicosia was the first school to accept bitcoin back in 2013. Other universities who accept the cryptocurrency include the University of Cumbria, King’s College in New York, and others. In Boston, you can use the decentralized currency at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) COOP store for textbooks and school supplies. ESMT Berlin will join the list of accredited schools worldwide that see a future with Bitcoin’s innovation and technology. Hopefully, these universities spark more academic interest in cryptocurrency solutions.  What do you think about ESMT Berlin accepting Bitcoin for school services? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-12-06T06:00:13-04:00,Malaysia Bitcoin Trading Volumes Rise as Capital Controls Tighten,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/malaysia-bitcoin-capital-controls/,"Over the past few years, Malaysia has imposed tight regulations on money transmission, remittances, and other financial operations, effectively complicating international payments and trading of foreign reserve currencies. These regulations have led to a rapid development of the Malaysian bitcoin market increasing demand for the cryptocurrency. Malaysia has previously had weak and poor Bitcoin infrastructure and shallow bitcoin exchange markets, which made purchasing and selling bitcoin difficult for the general population. However, recently several venture capital-backed bitcoin remittance and payment services providers have debuted in Malaysia, for example, Coin.ph – here branding its branch to Coins.my. Also read: Local Chinese Government Helps Fund Blockchain Startup The presence of startups including Coins.my allowed both the local Malaysian population as well as expat workers to send bitcoin payments abroad with ease. Coins.my also enables users to purchase and sell bitcoin using bank ATMs and remittance outlets, and settle utility bills such as rental, electricity and water fees with bitcoin. Over time, the demand for bitcoin has risen significantly in Malaysia, primarily due to the strict regulatory frameworks established for expat workers and foreign residents. Currently, Malaysia has a program in place called Employees Provident Fund (EPF), which forces local workers to save a portion of their monthly wages into a government-managed account. In all, Malaysian citizens are required to forfeit nearly 12% of their monthly wages to this fund, which is operated and managed by the local authorities. Apart from these regulations on wages, the Malaysian government also restricts the trading of the Malaysian ringgit, in hopes to prevent the devaluation of the country’s reserve currency. On December 2, Bank of Negara Malaysia revealed that it would intervene in the onshore ringgit market, in an attempt to provide higher liquidity of the reserve currency. “These measures are intended to promote a deeper, more transparent and well-functioning onshore FX market where genuine investors and market participants can effectively manage their market risks with greater flexibility to hedge on the onshore market. A deep and liquid onshore FX market will enable investors to better manage against volatile currency movements,” said the central bank. The central bank also announced that exporters and fund managers cannot store more than 25% of foreign currency without specific approval from the bank. “Resident and non-resident fund managers can now actively manage their FX exposure up to 25% of their invested assets. To qualify for this arrangement, registration with BNM would suffice.” LocalBitcoins, a peer to peer bitcoin trading network, has seen a substantial increase in weekly volume, nearly reaching US$405,000 in the past week.  On the LocalBitcoins two-year weekly trading volume chart, the demand for bitcoin has never been this high since the debut of LocalBitcoins in Malaysia in 2013. The highest peak was around US$200,000 in September when the price of bitcoin was at around US$606.  As the citizens of Malaysia and expat workers become increasingly aware of the seriousness of the country’s capital controls, the demand for safe haven assets like gold or bitcoin will rise in the upcoming months.

2016-12-05T21:00:39-04:00,Antonopoulos: Why Bitcoin Privacy is Understated,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/antonopoulos-bitcoin-privacy-understated/,"On a London Real Academy interview hosted by founder and host Brian Rose, security expert and digital currency expert Andreas Antonopoulos emphasized the importance of bitcoin privacy and how current banking systems are negatively impacting the general population. Also read: Andreas Antonopoulos: ‘The Open Blockchain Will Change This World’ Recently, India and Spain have been two of amongst many countries that have implemented extreme capital controls to eliminate illicit transfer and trades of money. Regardless of the intentions of the authorities, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s announcement, in particular, to demonetize 500 and 1,000 rupee banknotes has led to an economic shock as citizens continue to struggle to fund daily operations using cash. Throughout history, efforts of various governments and regulatory bodies to impose tight regulations on the flow of money have negatively impacted the innocent, or the 99% of the population that works to support the economy and society of their countries, instead of cracking down on criminals. Governments and authorities continue to dismiss the actuality of criminals and criminal activity. If cash or major assets like gold are banned, criminals will continue their operations based on other important assets or stores of value. For instance, during the interview, Antonopoulos described the Tide detergent controversy in 2013 as an example. A few years ago, criminals traded Tide detergent for drugs like cocaine due to the government’s crackdown on cash. Regardless of regulations, criminals will always search for alternative methods or emerging technologies to fund their operations and to obtain anonymity. “Criminals will have privacy,” said Antonopoulos. “The question is whether the rest of us will. Criminals will use these systems. They’ll will bribe corrupt officials, and they will bypass the rules. They will deal in gold or Rolexes or cars,” Antonopoulos continued. More importantly, Antonopoulos explained that strict regulations like the ones the Indian and Spanish governments are beginning to impose are affecting non-criminal users, or the general population. “Changing the way money works only ends up punishing the innocent. Criminals will always have privacy. What we should be doing is not to know your customer rules. What we should be doing is know your banker rules (KYB) and know your government (KYG). Because guess what, they’re funding the war criminals, they’re funding the terrorists, they’re paying the arms dealers, and they’re doing it using the banking system that they’re supposed to be doing an oversight on,” Antonopoulos stated. Brian Rose, founder, and the host of London Real, further emphasized the importance of bitcoin privacy or financial anonymity in general, as he explained that spending habits offer a wider and more descriptive overview of individuals in comparison to other information such as browser data. In the foreseeable future, Antonopoulos firmly believes that the only way people will develop awareness against surveillance of financial networks is when individuals become prosecuted for their spending habits. Until the majority realizes the importance of financial privacy and the fact that some governments will use financial data to control its population, the need for privacy will be dismissed. “If you give the government power over money, they will use it and in countries where the government is the criminal, they will use it to oppress people. Separating state and money should be a no-brainer. It is not yet. I hope we don’t have to learn that lesson the hard way,” said Antonopoulos.

The fiat value per BTC came very close to this past June’s high but fell short at $778 on December 2. Since then, the cryptocurrency’s price has dipped roughly 2.3% to a low of $748 at press time. However, charts still look as though the price will continuing pushing through higher paths of resistance. Also read: Enjoy the Holidays with This 2016 Bitcoin Gift Guide Technical indicators have shown a correction from this past weekend’s highs, which were slightly lower than the digital currency’s record value this year. At press time an ascending pattern is forming as the price bottomed out a touch below $750 early Monday morning. The bearish dip was to be expected after the bullish run, but a bounce back seems to coming soon. Bitcoin’s downward momentum has found its floor for the time being as buyers are growing.     Daily volume has been up to over $90 million, and bitcoin’s dominance has been resting at 86.8 percent. Volatility over the past week has proven profitable for intra-range strategies, while many traders are playing the breakouts and scalps. Currently across global exchanges that offer future options, most are seeing few short positions in comparison to long contracts. While volatility may keep shaking traders’ hands, long-term prospects towards $800 are still in sight. Moving averages from both the 100 SMA and 200 SMA show the uptrend may continue when looking at 4-hour and one-week charts. Bitcoin’s week in the headlines has been relatively positive with mainstream media taking notice to the digital currencies recent high. Furthermore, Google Trends shows the keyword/s “Buy Bitcoin” has increased drastically this year. Alongside this, the company Blockchain just recently reported its busiest week ever. Through November 20-27th over 2 million transactions were processed and the network showed congestion. The network is processing 300,000 transactions per day in comparison to 100,000 back in 2014. Geopolitical events have also been pushing demand for bitcoin to new highs. Worldwide economies have been experiencing turbulence in countries like Venezuela, India, and Turkey. India’s cash crisis has spurred significant bitcoin demand over the past few weeks. Furthermore, the Italian referendum took place with close to 60 percent opting to vote “no”, implying considerable uncertainty in Italian government and banking. Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has said he will soon submit his resignation as the populace clearly didn’t agree with his resolutions. Global market hiccups like this have caused more investors worldwide to seek solace using bitcoin as a safe haven.  As stated above, even though a slight correction took place last night, indicators still suggest a price uptrend. $800 USD is still attainable as buyers are eating through sell orders and resistance at press time. Additionally, LocalBitcoins volumes have been reaching all-time highs in nearly every nation. Prices on LocalBitcoins show $50-100 USD spreads in comparison to the average global exchange rate as well.  Bear Scenario: At the time of writing term support seems to be holding at the $750 range and forming to move upwards again. However, if a bearish trend pattern continues, we will see prices drop back to the $720 range but looks highly unlikely.  Bull Scenario: Currently the price is already consolidating higher reaching $752, and buying is steadily increasing looking at the depth and order books. Attaining this year’s high price position once again or even higher seems probable according to technical indicators. The heaviest resistance in sight is in the $820 range, but of course, things may still be volatile along the way.

2016-12-05T15:00:31-04:00,New Developments in Quantum Computing Impact Bitcoin,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-ready-quantum-computing/,"Quantum computing might be closer than we thought, thanks to a series of newly developed scientific methods. Furthermore, a new implementation of Shor’s algorithm increases the urgency of getting Bitcoin ready for the advent of quantum computing.  Also read: NIST Starts Developing Quantum-Resistant Cryptography Standards At present, Bitcoin is obviously resistant to all known types of cyberattacks. However, according to some experts, Bitcoin and IoT devices would not be immune from quantum-based attacks, at least in some respects. Announcements indicating that scientists are close to building a quantum computer are constantly streaming into the media. In November, University of Sussex scientists announced the discovery of a new technique to simplify the building of a quantum computer. “Scientists at the University of Sussex have invented a ground-breaking new method that puts the construction of large-scale quantum computers within reach of current technology,” said the University of Sussex Center for Quantum Technologies. In December, Tyndall National Institute also announced a new development, “Now a researcher and his team at Tyndall National Institute in Cork have made a ‘quantum leap’ by developing a technical step that could enable the use of quantum computers sooner than expected.” Building quantum computers is also gaining momentum in the business world. Giants like Microsoft, Intel, Google, and IBM are demonstrating their optimism about quantum computing to the extent that they are investing more resources and significantly increasing their research and development efforts. For example, Microsoft is investing large amounts of money, as its quantum team is getting ready to move from research to engineering. “Microsoft is doubling down on its commitment to the tantalizing field of quantum computing, making a strong bet that it is possible to create a scalable quantum computer using what is called a topological qubit,” said Microsoft. “I think we are at an inflection point in which we are ready to go from research to engineering,” says Todd Holmdahl, Vice President of Microsoft’s quantum. Quantum computing promises to bring immense processing and transmission power, which will be capable of solving complex problems faster than any appliance we have today. On the other hand, this very same power will make it easy to crack any data encrypted with current technology. The National Security Agency (NSA) recently issued a warning about the threat of a quantum computer. “A sufficiently large quantum computer, if built, would be capable of undermining all widely-deployed public key algorithms used for key establishment and digital signatures.” Consequently, NSA is already getting ready for the world of the quantum computers. Specifically, the NSA is switching to quantum-resistant cryptography. In this connection, in January 2016, NSA announced the transition from Suite B Cryptography to the Commercial National Security Algorithm. “The NSA announcement is designed to provide sufficient notice to National Security Systems (NSS) developers and operators to plan and budget for new cryptography as they design their systems. Cryptographic upgrades to NSS often require several years of planning. NSA wants to make sure all NSS owners and developers understand the long term need to transition, and include this in their budget, maintenance, and logistic plans.” MIT wonders whether quantum computers spell the end of encryption schemes, after announcing, “Researchers from MIT and the University of Innsbruck in Austria report that they have designed and built a quantum computer from five atoms in an ion trap. The computer uses laser pulses to carry out Shor’s algorithm on each atom, to correctly factor the number 15.” The report adds, “The results represent the first scalable implementation of Shor’s algorithm.” Peter Shor’s algorithm solves the problem of factoring very large numbers into primes. “By using this algorithm, a quantum computer would be able to crack codes much more quickly than any ordinary (or classical) computer could. In fact, a quantum computer capable of performing Shor’s algorithm would be able to break current cryptography techniques in a matter of seconds,” wrote Simone Bone and Matias Castro. Bitcoin uses the SHA-256 hash algorithm, RIPEMD160, and the Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) cryptography. Many believe that an attack from a quantum computer could crack ECDSA, but that SHA-256 and RIPEMD160 would remain immune. Nevertheless, NSA now recommends implementing SHA-384 instead of SHA-256. Indeed, NSA has ruled that NSS will no longer use SHA-256. Quantum computers are coming sooner than we thought. This fact combined with a new implementation of Shor’s algorithm highlights the urgency to act sooner rather than later. Indeed, it is time to start delving into quantum computing’s potential impact on Bitcoin to ensure that Bitcoin will remain post-quantum secure. Do you think Bitcoin is quantum-resistant?

2016-12-05T06:00:12-04:00,Last Week was Bitcoin’s ‘Busiest Week Ever’,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/blockchain-bitcoins-busiest-week-ever/,"During the last week of November the blockchain-monitoring company Blockchain announced Bitcoin had its “busiest” week ever, with over 2 million transactions processed. Also read: Central Bank of Germany Reveals Functional Securities Blockchain November has been a busy month for the decentralized currency bitcoin, as adoption has been on the rise. Over the course of the month, the cryptocurrency’s fiat value has also been growing exponentially. Blockchain.info revealed that between Nov. 20-27th the currency had 2 million transactions and a significant backlog in its mempool. According to the company, this milestone equated to over 300,000 transactions per day with longer than usual confirmation times.  Furthermore, the company explained the number of Blockchain wallets issued has increased by 35% over the past six months. This follows alongside Bitcoin.com’s recent report of the firm issuing its 10 millionth wallet. Blockchain stated these exponential rises have been “more intense” than traditional peaks in the past. “One thing to remark first is that this episode of intense activity is different from the previous one that occurred between Oct 24th and 28th,” explained Blockchain’s blog post. “While that was easily attributable to an entity that consolidated a great number of inputs, this episode is the contrary: the number of outputs increased at a greater rate than usual during the congestion. As the number of unspent outputs grow, the validation of blocks takes longer and puts a strain on the network.” Prior to Thanksgiving weekend, Bitcoin’s unconfirmed transaction levels jumped to over 50K with many complaining of network congestion. Luckily enough for Black Friday shoppers the mempool’s unconfirmed transactions subsided a great deal. Throughout the week of Nov. 20-27th, there were many community complaints of slow confirmation times.  As usual, the network’s congestion has caused the block size debate to continue. Many within the community have been discussing the signaling of Segregated Witness and alternate clients such as Bitcoin Unlimited. Furthermore, this week core developer Luke-jr has stated that a block size increase will happen eventually.  “There isn’t a change of mind, nor a contradiction here,” explains Luke-jr in a Reddit conversation. “We’re talking here about proposals to increase the block size limit. Of those, BIP 103 was the most reasonable.”       According to Blockchain during the period of high congestion “misbehaviors” related to unusual transactions increased dramatically. The company explains the pattern seems to follow the recent highs and lows within the mempool.  “A transaction can be rejected with this flag if it creates too long of a chain of unconfirmed transactions,” details Blockchain. “This indicates that such chains were created, either involuntarily due to longer than usual confirmation delays or voluntarily in an effort to stress test the network as it already happened in the past.” One thing is for sure: the price per BTC has risen significantly over the previous two months. The price increase has undoubtedly attributed to transaction volume and delays recently as well. It’s good to see new money flow into the network, but congestion can be aggravating to both novices and veterans alike. Many enthusiasts want the BTC value to continue its increase and hope the network is scaled in the near future.  What do you think about Blockchain’s busiest week ever?

2016-12-04T22:00:08-04:00,Enjoy the Holidays with This 2016 Bitcoin Gift Guide,Justin Connell,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-holiday-gift-guide/,"2016 is coming to a close, Christmas is coming up and bitcoin is, yet again, one of the year’s best performing assets. So, it’s time to get some gifts. There are lots of bitcoin-themed gifts out there and this gift guide presents some of the more interesting ones. Also read: Four Countries Priming Bitcoin Demand Worldwide BTCC is one of the most influential Bitcoin miners in the entire Bitcoin network. And, having researched the market and found a lack of physical bitcoins, Bobby Lee and his mining company set out to create a line of products so people could hold their bitcoins in a more tangible manner. Physical bitcoins have been a thing almost as long as Bitcoin itself, but early companies ran into issues. Much of their business (or their business itself) was based in the US, where such physical bitcoins have been subject to strict regulation. This meant early companies like Casascius coins went the way of the buffalo. But, BTCC Mint has stepped into fill that void — as long as your address isn’t in the US.  Long recognized bitcoin wallet Trezor is considered among the best wallets to give to a bitcoin-holding friend who worries about security. Hardware wallets lend increased standards for security then computers connected to the internet and (especially) online exchanges.  The Bitcoin space has witnessed (and suffered) numerous hacks of prominent online wallets and exchanges, costing users millions in the digital currency.  Help to ensure the bitcoiner in your life never suffers this unfortunate fate with a bitcoin hardware wallet. 
 Trezor, to be sure, is not the only hardware wallet on the market. Other companies such as KeepKey and Ledger also offer similar hardware options.  Let’s face it: our lives are busy. We don’t always know exactly what the loved ones in our life want for the holidays. But, the Bitcoin ecosystem has this problem covered. Gyft offers a wide array of gift cards that you can purchase with your coins. So, while the gift might not be bitcoin itself, it was at least purchased with the cryptocurrency.  There is a developed Bitcoin apparel market featuring shirts in the domain of the cyberpunk to straight nerd. You can find a litany of logos featuring Bitcoin-related memes from obscure mathematical references to darknet marketplace logos.  Bitcoin.com features this cool Banksy t-shirt.  Or how about a shirt that features a mushroom and a Bitcoin from Zazzle?  Whatever it is your Bitcoin friend or family member is into, there’s a shirt they’ll gladly sport. Check out the Bitcoin.com store and Zazzle for a taste of what’s available.  Various mediums of Bitcoin-themed art could look good as a postcard or as a huge piece on the wall in a bitcoiner’s home. There is a variety of art online inspired by bitcoin or available for bitcoin. These pieces include interpretations of the Bitcoin logo to paintings of fictional bitcoin-related themes and situations.  A flask, a travel mug, there’s numerous Bitcoin-themed items that might work well in a loved one’s kitchen at Cafepress.  Athough Bitcoin is technically just a bunch of 0’s and 1’s, there is no doubt a formidable market for Bitcoin-themed jewelry that you can sport, like this Bitcoin necklace. Keep the power of cryptography near and dear to your heart with this Casascius coin themed Bitcoin necklace. This is about as tech a gift you can get for someone at the holidays, so make sure it’s for a loved one that has the technical knowhow or dedication to really get started mining. And, also, unless you got free electricity (and even if you do) you probably won’t be making any money at all, and potentially losing money and risking burning a house down. Still, if a loved one is set on getting a miner, then an Antminer is one of the most popular miners on the market today.   This is like getting a loved one a dog or cat without them asking first. There’s a story that goes around about Easter that people purchase rabbits as a gift. The rabbits are then discarded by the receiver, who — it turns out — is unable to care for an animal. This is a Bitcoin ATM. It’s basically the dog, cat or rabbit of Bitcoin gifts.  Bitcoin ATMs take knowledge. They need love. The operator is responsible for not only the underlying software that drives the ATM, but, as well, the hardware customers actually use. For instance, a cash dispenser. Many Bitcoin ATMs have those. Do you know how to care for one of these things? They key pad — well, the key pad can break at anytime. And where are you going to keep your ATM? And once you do, what happens if someone decides they want to vandalize it? And we haven’t even gotten to managing the bitcoins yet.  But, let’s say you’ve got a sophisticated Bitcoin friend with some bitcoins sitting around doing nothing. And they just so happen to have a high-trafficked spot (let’s say, trafficked by those working in/around high risk industries), then by all means, give the gift of cashin’ in.  You can learn more about the different Bitcoin ATM’s at the very informative site, CoinATMRadar.com.  Any awesome Bitcoin-themed items our gift guide missed? Let us know in the comments!

2016-12-04T12:00:28-04:00,Four Countries Priming Bitcoin Demand Worldwide,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/countries-priming-bitcoin-demand/,"The global economy is currently facing an enormous shift as many countries are burdened with massive debt, resource shortages, and failing fiat currencies. A lot of banks worldwide are folding while the central banks try to fix markets by printing vast sums of money and lowering interest rates. However, more and more global citizens are finding a hedge from this turbulent economy within bitcoin. Here is a list of four countries to watch as any one of them could spark a significant rush towards the decentralized cryptocurrency. Also read: Finland’s Central Bank Explores Blockchain Technology The African country of Zimbabwe is suffering from economic hardships as leaders continue to fumble around with worthless ideas. Following the year 2000, Zimbabwe’s economy dropped like a rock as the citizens experienced widespread turmoil. From 2003 to 2009 the country experienced hyperinflation as the Zimbabwe dollar became worthless. Since then the country’s citizens use multiple types of national fiat currencies such as the yuan and U.S. dollar.  More recently the Zimbabwe banking system has created new bond notes which local businesses and the general public distrust. The new bond notes which have just recently begun circulating are said to be “incentive” a local told Bitcoin.com. Taedzwa Chikono explained the situation to our publication stating: Furthermore Bitcoin.com this past month reported on Phillip Haslam, an economist from the region who believes Bitcoin would help the Zimbabwean economy. “We are very excited about bitcoin as a stable currency alternative, explained Haslam. “The thing about bitcoin is once you import it into the country, you don’t have the problem of the currency eroding and perishing like you have with notes. It’s a system that allows for privatized banking. Effectively, the bitcoin system is both a currency and international payments platform.” Bitcoin adoption within India is on the rise as the country’s demonetization efforts have shaken the economy. Last month Prime Minister Narendra Modi removed high denomination rupees out of circulation. Since then the public has been in shock, and there has been a significant cash crisis within the region. With 500 and 1000 denomination rupees out of the system, India’s officials believe the public and private sector should embrace a cashless society. India has always been fertile ground for bitcoin use as the country has seen significant growth in adoption over the past two years. Since the rupee ban and following cash crisis, the demand for the cryptocurrency has risen exponentially. Exchanges in India have been reporting over $100-150 USD higher than most global rates. LocalBitcoins’ volumes have nearly doubled in the month of November, and many Indian bitcoin businesses are seeing record numbers of transactions. The Latin American country of Venezuela is currently going through some hard economic times. Hyperinflation has struck the land as the socialist government’s fiat currency, the bolivar, has become nearly worthless. Citizens of the nation are suffering from food shortages and actually weighing large stacks of bolivars instead of counting the currency. Experts expect the currency’s inflation rate to be over 700% at the end of 2016. However, things have gotten worse as economists believe the inflation rate will be a massive 1500% by next year. Venezuelan bitcoin adoption has also been on the rise as many are turning to the decentralized cryptocurrency to hedge against inflation. LocalBitcoins’ volumes in Venezuela have been at an all-time high, and other bitcoin businesses are seeing “soaring demand.” Furthermore, Venezuelan residents are also participating in the mining process making a more lucrative living according to a recent editorial by Reason. In the report, many Venezuelans describe how they are creating a sustainable underground economy by resorting to mining bitcoins, sending remittances, and other counter economic methods. Back in July, Bitcoin.com reported on Turkish residents resorting to bitcoin during the country’s recent military coup. Since then bitcoin adoption in Turkey has been steadily climbing. LocalBitcoins’ volumes have also risen this November exponentially. Most likely the cryptocurrency’s popularity in Turkey is because of the horrible economy due to Turkish bureaucrats monetary failures.  Also the country’s currency the Turkish Lira has lost considerable purchasing power this past year. Recently Turkish President Recep Erdogan has tried to convince residents to convert their hidden foreign currencies back into the Lira. With Turkey’s tumultuous economic times, bitcoin is becoming known as a safe haven and could very well help Turkish citizens. Other countries around the world are also trying to overcome economic hardships such as Greece, Spain, Mexico, and many others. And geopolitical events have caused a significant rush towards bitcoin hedging as well. This includes the U.S. election, this summer’s Brexit, and now the upcoming Italian referendum. As world economies falter, bitcoin will be there for global citizens looking for security, anti-censorship, and the ultimate control over their own wealth.

2016-12-02T15:00:52-04:00,Russian Tax Office Updates Legal Stance On Bitcoin,Kei K,https://news.bitcoin.com/russian-tax-office-legal-bitcoin/,"A Russian Federal Tax Service Letter released a few weeks ago spelled out issues – including an implied statement that cryptocurrencies are not illegal – amongst others that affect the legal status of cryptocurrencies moving forward. Also read: Sberbank CEO Shares His Bitcoin Experiences The legal implications of the letter was the focal point at the recent event, ‘Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Russia‘, on Nov 10. The conference was one of the biggest cryptocurrency events that took place in Eastern Europe. The event attracted dozens of representatives from the banks, corporations, media, as well as the public. It is a clear sign of inert interest in Russia with regards to cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and its legal status. Service letter outlines*:
1) The Russian laws do not define such terms as money surrogate, cryptocurrency, or virtual currency.
 2) The Russian laws do not contain any prohibitions as to operations with cryptocurrencies conducted by Russian citizens and organizations.
 3) Using cryptocurrencies in transactions is a basis for considering such transactions as possibly related to laundering of illegally obtained money, and terrorism funding.
 4) The FTS of Russia believes that operations related to procurement or sale of cryptocurrencies involving currency values (i.e. foreign currencies or external securities) and/or Russian currency are essentially monetary operations.
 5) The existing monetary control system does not provide for reception of data on buy/sale operations with cryptocurrency from residents and nonresidents.
 * According to Forklog. At the event, Artem Tolkachev, the Chairman of Blockchain Community, shared his opinions on ways to constitute cryptocurrencies in Russia. First and foremost, cryptocurrencies lack a clear definition in Russia’s Laws, hence amendments to the legal status of cryptocurrencies in the Civil Code would be necessary. After that, suitable regulations could start to fall into place. This is very much in line with the implied response found in the service letter. The service letter has revealed that as for now, it is not illegal to carry out cryptocurrencies trade activities in Russia. However, individuals and companies are concerned about the outcome of the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Russia as this may affect organizations business plans in futures. Russia has the reputation of being wishy-washy when it comes to whether cryptocurrencies are illegal or not. However, it is a positive sign that there are no prohibitions in carrying out cryptocurrencies trade activities, as compared to the earlier threats of imposing jail terms on bitcoin users. The key concern for governments when it comes to cryptocurrencies is pretty much on how to devise measures to combat money laundering and other nefarious activities. Regulatory initiatives are generally well accepted by the public as compared to a total ban of digital currencies.  Also, in accordance with the service letter, Elina Sidorenko emphasized at an earlier event this year, “Cryptocurrency is rarely used to financing terrorism”. However, measures should be in place to give clear indications for Russia in terms of the Dos-and-Don’ts when it comes to cryptocurrencies. Elina Sidorenko also pointed out that State Duma’s Working Group’s had scheduled a meeting. The purpose of the meeting will further discuss these related matters. The meeting will be held on December 15, 2016. While the outcome is still unclear, the outlook for cryptocurrencies has become brighter. Once cryptocurrencies are given distinguishable legal status, other interconnected issues can be worked out.     [Disclaimer: Contains Unofficial translation]  Official Source: Russian Federal Tax Service Letter dated 03.10.2016 No. ОА-18-17/1027 Image Source: SBS News, Blockchain & Bitcoin Conference Russia, Fork Log Do you think further amendments in Russia’s Laws will come into place?

2016-12-01T06:00:21-04:00,Italian Referendum Could Send Global Investors to Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/italian-referendum-investors-bitcoin/,"This year’s Brexit vote caused turbulent economic times for European residents, as many sovereign currencies and stocks plunged. During this period, the British exit from the EU caused Bitcoin’s value to spike as many turned to the decentralized currency as an economic safe haven. On December 4, the cryptocurrency’s price may rise again as the Italian constitutional referendum prepares to shake up Europe’s economy once more. Also read: IRS Demands Coinbase Records In Surprise Tax Probe December 4 will be an eventful day for worldwide markets, as the globe may get an economic shock. Italian citizens will vote on amending the constitution by changing resolutions — alongside absolving powers given to the state, Parliament, and bureaucrats. During this time Italian government bonds and securities have been selling like hotcakes with many preparing for an economic crisis.  Furthermore, Prime Minister Matteo Renzi has detailed he will quit if people vote against the Italian bank resolutions. The European region is indeed preparing for a rude awakening as the Financial Times reported eight troubled banks could fall by the wayside if Renzi loses. If the Italian referendum goes sour, it could mean investors could turn to an uncorrelated asset such as bitcoin.  Italian residents have six cryptocurrency exchanges to choose from, including: Coinbase, CleverCoin, LocalBitcoins, The Rock Trading, BitBoat, and Bitstamp. Moreover, the country has eight bitcoin ATMs and a friendly environment for purchasing cryptocurrencies. Just recently, Italy’s largest cab service started accepting the virtual currency for fares. And a bitcoin price surge may not be only limited to Italy if the vote sparks global purchasing. On June 23 the bitcoin price dipped to a low of $550, yet just before the Brexit vote came in the cryptocurrency spiked to $675. As soon as the  “Leave” decision was announced, global stock markets began to plunge. However, gold and bitcoin values went up significantly as investors turned to safer hedges. One week before the vote took place the San Francisco-based exchange Coinbase saw a 55% rise in British registrants and a 350% increase in UK sales.  The British bitcoin push is “a reminder that bitcoin has long been a hedge against turmoil in Greece, capital controls in China, and macroeconomic issues,” said a Coinbase spokesperson. Another European exchange, Kraken, also witnessed significant demand during the Brexit vote.   “A lot of people are buying bitcoin for pounds and euros,” said Jesse Powell, CEO of San Francisco-based Kraken, the world’s largest bitcoin exchange in euro volume. “Our volume has doubled over the last 24 hours. We saw a huge spike in that market. People are looking for a safe place to keep their money, amidst all of this uncertainty.” Italy is one of the EU’s largest debtors, and the aftermath of its controversial referendum vote could be disastrous. The country’s borrowing has led to financial instability as many of the banks have been mismanaging lending practices. Financial Times reporter Rachel Sanderson stated, “Italy’s banks have €360bn of problem loans versus €225bn of equity on their books after successive regulators and governments failed to tackle a bloated financial system where profitability was weakened by a stagnant economy and exacerbated by fraudulent lending at several institutions.” Many countries around the world are suffering from economic hardships. Bitcoin use is increasing within these regions such as Venezuela’s hyper-inflation to India’s recent demonetization. Italy’s referendum is sure to cause market chaos. The question is, will people again turn to Bitcoin again amidst the economic shakeup?  What do you think about the situation in Italy? Let us know in the comments below.

Last weekend, San Francisco public transit fare systems began to refuse commuters’ money. The hacker demanded 100 bitcoin from SFMTA to put its payment systems back in place to undo the revenue loss. Also read: Ransomware Fines Could Cost UK Business £122bn San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA) refused to honor the ransom. Instead, it opened the gates to allow millions of commuters to commute for free to minimize disruption. By the following Monday, SFMTA’s business was back to normal. However, it is still unknown how the system got back up. SFMTA lost approximately $559,000 in revenue each day of the Black Friday hack. Additionally, the ransom would have cost approximately $73,000. Such attacks are prevalent in this technologically advanced age —  especially at organizations where IT security is not upgraded to keep up with hackers’ technology. Extortionists can easily hack into outdated systems to encrypt them. The hacker then demands a ransom to have encryption unlocked — and even then, decryption does not come with a guarantee. According to The Verge, who contacted the hacker, the hacker has confirmed he was seeking a deal with SFMTA to undo the damage. As well as the hacked payment systems, employees’ laptops, email and printed services, payroll systems, and SQL databases were also compromised. In a terse statement, SFMTA said it had regained control of the payment system, while the rest is still under the hacker’s control. The damage could have resulted in far more devastating results if the hacker had used his access to threaten the operational safety of transit services such as the train system and buses. The statement cited an ongoing investigation of the incident as the reason for not releasing more details. Organizations should have policy and procedures in place for cyber attacks, to manage risk and control damage. With that said, investments in the upgrade of IT security would have likely prevented such losses. Bitcoin alone does not give opportunities to hackers for extortion. Sufficient IT knowledge and investment are some of the key factors in this time and age to prevent exploitation of IT infrastructures. To end on a lighter note: the Black Friday hack might have actually boosted the US economy on a Black Friday sales weekend, with all those extra free-riding travelers out spending money.

2016-11-28T12:00:27-04:00,Gambling-Inspired Bitcoin Chips May Appeal to Chinese Market,Kei K,https://news.bitcoin.com/btcc-gambling-bitcoin-chips-chinese/,"Gambling is ingrained in Chinese culture and social interactions. These symbolic poker chip-influenced physical bitcoin chips may even drive up bitcoin value. Infiltration into the non-IT savvy Chinese market is fairly likely.  Also read: Chinese exchange and mining company BTCC launches titanium physical bitcoin series BTCC has launched the “six color signature set” of physical bitcoin chips in six denominations. These range from 1,000 bits to 500,000 bits.
 BTCC’s belief in physical bitcoin chips lies in the continued ascendancy of bitcoin and its usage. These chips could be used as a bridge to introduce bitcoin to the non-IT savvy market.   The hologram sticker on the chips’s reverse side consists of the private key with its QR code. It brings convenience to IT-savvy consumers who can then scan the code to import the value into any bitcoin wallet. In May this year, BTCC released its first series of physical bitcoin tokens. The titanium coins contained values loaded with as-yet-unused coins from BTCC’s own mining operation. BTCC’s tokens are produced by the same company that made the popular “Satoricoin” tokens, also modeled on gambling chips. As bitcoin continues to gain popularity with the Chinese as a kind of “safe haven”, as well as their cultural love for a speculative gamble, the physical bitcoin chips may well gain traction as money, too. As the Chinese yuan further weakens, coupled with the festive Lunar New Year drawing near, chances of the physical bitcoin chips used as an alternative to giving fiat currency in ‘red packets’ is plausible. The 2016 “Internet Usage and Population Statistics” report showed that 52.3% of China’s 1.3 billion people are internet users. The untapped market for potential bitcoin usage from the percentage of the population who do not use the internet is huge. The next question to ask is: How will the non-IT savvy market cash out their physical bitcoin chips? The masses in China who are already into bitcoin will likely be able to exchange the chips for cash face-to-face. How do you like the idea of physical bitcoin chips reaching out to the non-Internet users?

Furthermore, the professional services company will install a bitcoin ATM in the main building of its Swiss office. Also read: Blockchain’s 10 Millionth Wallet And ‘Not Looking Back’  EY Switzerland says the firm believes in the digitalization of emerging technology and innovation. Early on, the company bolstered blockchain technology in its written research findings for clientele. This January 2017 Switzerland’s EY customers will be pay for auditing and advisory invoices with Bitcoin. After adding bitcoin support, the company will install the bitcoin ATM in one of its offices in Zurich. The company explains the automated teller will be accessible to both EY employees and Swiss residents in the area. The Switzerland branch will also give employees an EY wallet app that enables “excellent protection against unauthorized access within the EY system environment.” The main point of the new services and ATM is to drive digitalization awareness to EY employees and clients. “We don’t only want to talk about digitalization, but also actively drive this process together with our employees and our clients,” explains Marcel Stalder, CEO of EY Switzerland.  “It is important to us that everybody gets on board and prepares themselves for the revolution set to take place in the business world through blockchains, smart contracts, and digital currencies. Blockchains are a very quickly developing technology that can permanently change many sectors. In Switzerland’s role as an important financial and industrial center and to further its development as a digital hub, it is essential that it be a pioneer in this area.” EY Switzerland says as a financial professional services firm it advises and supports educating clients about transformative technologies. The company says that some customers are already creating “end-to-end products” which require advisement on new processes, risks, regulatory policy, and tax guidelines. Virtual currency solutions and blockchain technology have been on the forefront of innovation and EY has been eyeing this trend for quite some time.    Daniel Haudenschild, EY Partner Advisory Financial Services says that EY’s innovation laboratory the “EY Garage Lab” is developing smart contract products with clients. “In combination with digital currencies, the benefits of such products, including low transaction costs and automated processing, can be fully realized,” he added. EY wants to help progress Switzerland’s leadership as a digital hub. The country is well known for being friendly towards cryptocurrency innovation and blockchain protocols. EY Switzerland is the founding member of Digital Switzerland a group that supports digital innovation in global markets. The firm is also co-sponsoring the World Web Forum 2017 next year in Zurich, and will be presenting EY developed blockchain solutions. Additionally, EY Switzerland is collaborating on research with the University of St. Gallen and the ETH Zurich. The research will be focused on transforming the financial industry by exploring services that provide long-term value to clientele. The groups will initially identify areas and solutions in regards to “client interaction and advisory services.” Finally, the last step will be developing and testing solutions with clients in the company’s fintech lab.  EY isn’t the first Big Four firm to add a Bitcoin ATM and educate clients and employees on the decentralized cryptocurrency. Deloitte’s Toronto office also recently installed a Bitcoin ATM and is educating employees. Iliana Oris Valiente, the business development manager and co-founder of Rubix, Deloitte’s blockchain team, told Bitcoin.com, “It’s the best way to illustrate the power of the technology.” However, EY Switzerland is taking it a step further by allowing clients to pay for invoices with Bitcoin and utilizing an EY custom wallet. There’s no doubt that big financial incumbents are taking Bitcoin seriously.  What do you think about EY Switzerland’s latest initiative with Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below.

Leung Chung-Hang and Yau Wai-Ching were disqualified by the High Court over their oath-taking debacle last month, but plan to appeal. Also read: Free Ross-A-Thon Event Aims to Promote Freedom The duo are not giving up their quest for democratic rights — at least not without a fight. They are seeking funds to appeal for the resumption of their seats for their political party called ‘Youngspiration’. Yau and Leung are advocates who have called for a ‘complete split‘ away from mainland China. Prior to taking their seats in parliament, the duo trotted out flags that stated “Hong Kong is not China” during their oath-taking session. The action enraged officials in Beijing, and allegedly led Hong Kong’s Chief Executive to “throw in everything“ to launch a legal challenge to remove the duo from office.  Beijing’s controversial intervention has come as a shock to many Hong Kongers. Barrister and former lawmaker Margaret Ng suggested that such intervention has violated multiple provisions of the Basic Law. When Hong Kong was under British rule, freedom (of speech) was applauded. However after Hong Kong’s return to mainland China in 1997, the “One Country. Two Systems” policy seems to be increasingly restrictive as Beijing has interfered in Hong Kong’s ruling systems by removing “troublemakers” — and a wide range of other political issues. Yau’s is standing firm, stating that: Some think the two have only themselves to blame for losing their seats, through their provocative action during the oath-taking. Others say Hong Kong has already “gone under” the communist ruling style after Beijing interfered in legal procedures. According to a CNN report: The duo are seeking donations of HK$5 million (USD 650,000) from the public to fund an appeal to fight against the ruling. Youngspiration also had one of their PayPal accounts frozen. Hence they are left with four other options — checks, electronic checks, bank transfers… and bitcoin. The politicians chose to accept bitcoin, as it encourages contributors to support their movement anonymously. When it comes to appealing a controversial legal decision, the risks associated with the other remaining funding methods are highly plausible. In such a case, bitcoin funding may well be the last method standing. If democracy is a game, bitcoin is a kind of rule. What are your thoughts when politicians accept bitcoin for these purposes? Let us know in the comments. Images via Youngspiration Facebook Page, REUTERS/Bobby Yip, HKFP- Facebook.

2016-11-26T12:00:03-04:00,Ukraine Latest Central Bank Considering Bitcoin Tech,Francisco Memória,https://news.bitcoin.com/29643-2/,"Central banks all over the world are exploring the possibilities of creating their own national digital currencies based on Bitcoin’s “blockchain” technology. This digital currency “movement” was first seen in Tunisia but has made its way to Ukraine, Senegal and Sweden. Also read: Ukraine Bank Roadmap: Blockchain-Based Payments by Q4 2017 Ukraine just joined a growing number of central banks getting in on the electronic money concept. As part of the nation’s Cashless Economy project, the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) is to issue a blockchain-based digital version of the Hryvnia by next year. At first the currency will circulate alongside its physical version. The move isn’t surprising, as NBU has in September stated it was “interested in further development of high-tech financial markets in Ukraine as it will positively influence the implementation of the Cashless Economy project”. Riksbanken in Sweden, the world’s oldest central bank, is considering the same move as the country has seen a decline in cash use, according to the Financial Times. It’s still in discussions whether digital currencies should complement notes and coins, or replace them. Soon the country may witness the introduction of an “ekrona” (“e-coin”), a blockchain-based digital version of the Swedish Krona. The Bank of England and the Bank of Canada have reportedly discussed issuing their own digital currencies using blockchain technology. The immense cost reduction in transactions could, according to a report from the Bank of England, boost GDP by roughly 3%. Late last year, Tunisia had over half a million people using its digital currency, eDinar. The country’s post office, La Poste Tunisienne, then announced it would partner with Monetas and DigitUs to integrate the country’s digital currency with blockchain technology. It was the first one to do so. Following Tunisia’s footsteps, Senegal announced in early November it was also going to get their digital currency eCFA integrated with blockchain technology as well. The new currency is to circulate alongside the country’s fiat currency CFA Franc, just like in Tunisia. Unlike bitcoin, these currencies are issued solely by a country’s central bank. Do you think other countries will soon announce their own blockchain-based digital currencies? Images courtesy of Pixabay. "
2016-11-25T08:00:24-04:00,Insurance Coverage For Bitcoin Exchanges Against Cyber Attacks,Kei K,https://news.bitcoin.com/insurance-bitcoin-exchanges-attacks/,"Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance has tailored coverage for bitcoin exchanges facing the risks of rampant cyber attacks. This sense of assurance may boost consumers’ confidence — but what else should they know about such coverage? Also read: Bitfinex Bail-In Versus Central Bank Bailouts
 Together with bitFlyer, Mitsui Sumitomo Insurance (MSIG) aims to provide protection to exchanges and their consumers, regardless of location. As cryptocurrency use continues to grow, exchanges and consumers might as well benefit from this initiative. Under this insurance protection, exchanges are looking at a coverage sum ranging between 10 million yen (USD 89,000) to 1 billion yen (USD 8.9 million). This sum protects against detrimental losses and damages from cyber attacks, unauthorized accesses, employees’ impropriety, and also the costs that arise in dealing with the mishaps. MSIG will calculate insurance premium costs based on the exchange’s commission revenue. This cost will range between several hundred thousand to several million yen. Japan’s top bitcoin exchange, bitFlyer, has monthly transactions amounting to more than 100 billion yen (USD 889 million). Hence, commission revenue-based arrangements would likely encourage even smaller-scale exchanges to offer an insurance product. The Mt Gox bankruptcy in 2014 has led bitcoin consumers to scrutinize the potential vulnerability of exchange employee misconduct. Despite this bad publicity, the global bitcoin market is growing stronger than ever. According to Nikkei Asian Review:  Implementation of the insurance product is a step forward in providing assurance to consumers against the unforeseen risks of cyber security.  The ‘Terms and Conditions’ of compensation may differ amongst exchanges, and consumers should do their research beforehand, to avoid disputes when claims arise. For instance, whether the compensation of losses is paid in bitcoin units or at market value in fiat could make a substantial difference. Consumers and exchanges alike should practice security hygiene to minimize potential damages. Exchanges should not be used as a bitcoin storage wallet. Consumers can apportion their bitcoin according to their intended use to minimize the risk of huge losses in this instance. One good practice is to skim through terms and conditions, as for most things, not everything is covered or protected. After all, security knowledge as an insurance policy could also be one of the best policies. Share with us your views on how insurance coverage for bitcoin exchanges may benefit consumers.

2016-11-25T06:00:42-04:00,Meet Bitcoin Unlimited Developer Andrew Stone,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-unlimited-developer-andrew-stone/,"Bitcoin.com recently chatted with Bitcoin Unlimited (BU) developer Andrew Stone to discuss the alternative client and the current block size debate. Lately, the cryptocurrency community has been asking who the BU developers are, and what are their qualifications. This interview is meant to shed some light on development and Stone’s opinion of the goals BU is trying to accomplish.  Also read: ViaBTC Mines First Bitcoin Unlimited 2MB Block, Allocates Full Hashpower Bitcoin.com (BC): Can you describe to our readers a simple version of what Bitcoin Unlimited is and how it addresses scalability?  Andrew Stone (AS): Bitcoin Unlimited recognizes that Nakamoto Consensus (proof of work) is the only infallible consensus mechanism and that arbitrary agreements like Core’s 1MB block size are “social consensus.” Bitcoin Unlimited does not believe that it’s in its users’ interest to be on a minority fork unless the reason for the fork is to protect Bitcoin’s function as money. BC: How did you get involved with the BU project and who else is on the team of developers?  AS: Many of the general ideas that became Bitcoin Unlimited were being discussed on the “Gold Collapsing Bitcoin Up” thread on the bitco.in forum. All of the people on that forum at that time deserve credit and thanks for coming up with ideas. I was part of that discussion and proposed the “emergent consensus” (we didn’t call it that back then) algorithm there. I then wrote the BU Articles of Federation (our bylaws) and made the initial client release.  At that point, I was essentially a benevolent dictator. I then ran the elections specified in the BU Articles and ceded authority to the winners. Peter Tschipper and Andrea Suisani were early developers, and Peter Rizun deserves special mention for helping Bitcoin Unlimited’s early days with his insights and analytics. With the adoption of BU by two mining pools, we have many new contributors and so I shall not enumerate everyone here.  BC: Why do you think Bitcoin Core developers are against alternative clients like BU?  AS: I cannot say why particular people are against alternative clients.  But I can provide some ideas about why someone might be against alternative clients in general. First, you might wish for an earlier, simpler time. Like in 2012 when Bitcoin had a market cap of $50 million. Some things are easier in a single-client environment, especially if you are in charge of that client. However, that situation is gone.  The situation today is even worse.  We even have multiple protocols… the Satoshi client P2P protocol, the Fibre broadcast network, the Falcon network.  Hashing devices use their own custom protocol, “stratum.” But diversity is ultimately strength — a bug in “the” client won’t halt the entire network. Second, if you can’t justify your real issue (larger blocks), you might grab at whatever argument is convenient. Third, you haven’t really internalized the “FLP” result and think that all developers can just “get together” and come to a decision in a manner similar to the way protocols are specified in the industry. However, without strict control over the membership and participation, this is a fantasy. Protocols inevitably have competitors and incompatible extensions. A good example of this is the assignment of USB identifiers. To get a USB id, you need to join the USB consortium (membership costs many thousands of dollars). This model does not work in the open source hardware community where individuals are creating awesome but very-small-market devices. Ultimately people realized that information is free — legally the USB consortium cannot enforce this restriction unless you put the USB trademark on your product. So people just started picking random IDs. BC: When Adam Back and others make statements about BU being “semi-tested” and BU developers are unqualified, how do these opinions sit with you? AS: It is pretty upsetting because these people are themselves unqualified to make these statements. And I don’t mean technically. I mean that they have never shown that they have examined the code that they are criticizing.   It is clear that anyone who is a Core developer or whose company employs Core developers benefits dramatically from having Bitcoin Core remain the single majority client. Therefore these individuals have a massive unacknowledged conflict of interest. So I’d ask everyone who reads these statements to dismiss them as FUD until and unless actual data is provided. I finally responded to Adam’s criticism by showing that the Core code has significant and ongoing (recently added) flaws. I did so reluctantly because developers make mistakes.  Bugs are an unfortunate part of software development today. However, by doing so, I showed that Bitcoin Unlimited has actually tested more situations than Core. And I needed to dispel the myth that the Bitcoin Core code and developers are somehow uniquely qualified to develop Bitcoin software needed to be dispelled. In fact, the code is worse than I see in many mission critical applications. BC: Can you tell us your qualifications and why members of the team are qualified to work on Bitcoin’s protocol?   AS: I cannot comment on the qualifications of the other members of the Bitcoin Unlimited team (since I do not know their history), other than to say that I’ve personally reviewed their work and find it generally excellent. I have worked in high availability and mission critical applications for my entire career, so I am no stranger to the care required to develop this kind of code. My work with OpenClovis, Inc means that my software is running in almost every major telecom company worldwide, embedded in other telecom devices. We do not receive numbers of users depending on OpenClovis software, however, based on the numbers we DO receive, I’d guess it is in the hundreds of millions of people. If you have a cell phone in South Korea, you are using the software I wrote. If you have a Verizon cell phone, you are likely using my software.  If you have a cell phone home range extender, you are probably using it. If your company has SIP-based phones, or a redundant ethernet enterprise class switch, there’s a chance you are using us (it depends on the brand your company purchased). BC: In a recent post called “A Short Tour of Bitcoin Core” you describe various bugs found within the core client. Do you think the community should take these bugs more seriously?   AS: Of course. The high availability industry has the concept of “5000-year” bugs. These are bugs that typically happen rarely. However, if you are running 5000 clients, or you hit an abnormal operating condition, these rare bugs can suddenly start happening more frequently.  In the telecom industry, EVERY SINGLE crash or core dump is traced to a probable root cause even if that means manually examining code for hours and adding conditional “forcing” statements to trigger a specific code flow that is not normally possible to trigger using external input. We need similar care taken in the Bitcoin code. Part of the purpose of that exercise was to let individuals show their merits. Posting denials without actual investigation and excuses like “this only runs in debug mode” is a big problem.  Frankly, the responses by certain individuals to my post should have made you more worried about the Core development methodology than my critique itself. Because every piece of software has bugs, my pointing out three of them should have simply proven to you that Bitcoin Unlimited is, in fact, competent at development, knowledgeable in the code base and testing well. It should not really reflect that poorly on Core. But if the contributors deny them without checking, that is a problem. What other bugs have been similarly denied? And one of the worst denials is “A can’t happen because of (seemingly unrelated) X, Y, and Z.” The problem is that if that philosophy pervades the code base, you end up with code with a lot of implicit dependencies which can only be developed and maintained by the original authors or by people who have been involved in the project for a long time.  And defending running code that produced undefined behavior in debug mode is a real problem. Because developers run in debug mode. If you have a bug that is causing a problem in debug mode, developers may “fix” that problem, resulting in bugs in production code. For example, the lack of locks around the node cleanup code is a probable example of this happening. These locks may have been removed because in debug mode, the dd_mutex may be already cleaned up, resulting in an assert within boost (invalid mutex). But the effect of removing the locks (which we saw in our testing) is that you can get a core dump, in the extremely rare situation where a peer drops the connection at the exact moment you are shutting down. BC: What has BU done to improve upon Core’s programming mistakes?  AS: Find ‘em, fix ‘em!  And of course, we have our own development methodology to discourage the introduction of these errors, and are restructuring (to some degree, we also want to be able to rebase) the code to solve entire classes of issues. BC: BU has removed the block size hard limit and allows people to choose what the block size will be, is this assumption correct? How does that work?  AS: Yes, Peter Rizun has produced an excellent document describing this — the “emergent consensus” algorithm. It really needs an entire article, so let me just refer you to it. We have also done theoretical and analytical work justifying the proposal, which you can find in Peter’s “fee market” paper and my “single transaction (empty) block” paper. To sum that work up in a single sentence:  “Network propagation and block validation delays will create a non-zero cost for transactions, and limit the average block size to the average capacity of the underlying physical network.” BC: How does BU differ from clients such as Bitcoin Classic and XT?  AS: BU recognizes that an algorithmic “stakeholder consensus” above Nakamoto Consensus is not actually possible. For example, one significant criticism of Classic and XT was “what if miners falsely signal for large blocks but then when the time comes reject them?” BU recognizes the impossibility of this higher layer consensus (or more accurately, that Nakamoto Consensus is the only known algorithm to implement it — and by the way, from a theoretical perspective it avoids the FLP result because it never actually achieves consensus — if an alien with awesome tech recomputed the blockchain from the genesis block, Nakamoto Consensus would switch to that chain), and so does not have any coordination algorithm that automatically changes consensus parameters. Instead, BU removes most non-money-function-protecting parameters from the consensus layer.  So if the rest of the network suddenly goes to bigger blocks, you’ll follow. But if someone spends someone else’s money or gives himself an overly large block reward, you will not.    And it requires operator involvement to actually generate the first large block. This allows a miner to quickly back down if it turns out that other miners are falsely signaling (“one false process” in the FLP terminology). BC: The Bitcoin community has recently announced a $1.2 million grant towards protocol development. What is your opinion of the overall message of the principles tethered to this new grant?  AS: Its great that people are willing to fund development of Bitcoin! The message is completely on target. The “Blockstream model” where a for-profit commercial company heads up development seems to not be in the best interest of bitcoin as a currency and holders of the bitcoin currency. BC: What is the BU team’s opinion of segregated witness?  AS: I cannot speak for the team, or more importantly I cannot speak for the BU members.  My opinion is that:  It is needless complexity added to the blockchain.  It does not scale enough to interest any companies in creating Bitcoin products or services, it does not even scale enough to significantly deploy off-chain scaling solutions.   It has an ~1.7MB eventual size but a 4MB spam liability (does this mean that a simple hard fork increase to 2MB results in an 8MB total block?  Because emotionally 2MB is easy on today’s network, but 8MB is perhaps “pushing it”)     It does not remove existing issues (like malleability) because you can always generate old-style transactions, this creates a lot of “technical debt” that will make Bitcoin much harder to maintain and extend in the future  It does solve some existing issues if SegWit-style transactions are used. But many other known issues did not make the “cut” (the fact that other issues were promised but weren’t included hints at the development complexity of SegWit — the feature is a half-year late and missing features).  A completely new transaction format can solve many more problems, more simply and elegantly.  It forces every wallet to change their code. BC: What would you like to say to the community in regards to trusting you guys with the Bitcoin protocol? AS: You don’t need to. You should not trust anyone. BU supports and encourages multiple client implementations, and we give you the tools to rely on Nakamoto Consensus.  At the same time, we bitcoin holders and are not employed by for-profit companies with competing blockchains… BC: Do you see the block size situation resolving anytime soon?  AS: Yes, I hope so. I think that individual and corporate support of Bitcoin Unlimited, either publicly, or by speaking privately to large miners will make a big difference.  Let us show the miners that the economic and business majority wants larger blocks!

2016-11-24T06:00:01-04:00,European Commission’s New Boost for Bitcoin and Blockchain Startups,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/european-boost-blockchain-startups/,"The European Commission (EC) recently unveiled the new ‘Start-up and Scale-up Initiative’. Its aim is to increase Europe’s competitiveness for entrepreneurs and innovative startups by reducing regulatory barriers. Also read: ECB to EU: Tighter Regulations, Less Anonymity on Digital Currencies  According to the pan-European Trade Association EBAN, Europe has more entrepreneurs per capita than the United States. “The problem, however, is that European companies seldom grow to scale,” EBAN wrote. Unlike U.S. startups such as Apple, Amazon, and Google, European startups often remain one to three-person companies. Their innovative ideas seldom leave local economies, usually confined to just a single country. Commissioner for Digital Economy and Society, Günther Oettinger, explained that many EU businesses remain small. They “fail after a few years, or decide to move to other countries rather than tapping into the EU’s potential of a 500 million people customer base,” he said. “The European Commission is determined to change that and help start-ups deliver their full innovation and job creation potential,” the EC announced. Oettinger noted that new businesses account for nearly all of net job creation in the EU. Commissioner Elżbieta Bieńkowska, responsible for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs, said: Three regulatory changes are already in the works. Firstly, startups will have better access to finance. Secondly, the Commission will offer a second chance for entrepreneurs. It has already tabled a legislative proposal on insolvency law to allow companies in financial difficulties to restructure early on to prevent bankruptcy and avoid laying off staff. Lastly, taxation will be simplified. The Commission wants to “help start-ups stay and grow in Europe,” said Vice-President Jyrki Katainen who is responsible for Jobs, Growth, Investment and Competitiveness. This initiative will benefit bitcoin and blockchain businesses starting out or scaling up in Europe. “There are now more and more successful scale-up stories in Europe,” Oettinger revealed, citing the Luxembourg-based Blockchain as an example. Bitcoin startups, however, may face a different challenge when operating in Europe as the Commission has committed to ending anonymity associated with digital currencies. The EC has recently adopted a proposal by the European Parliament to bring digital currency operators and wallet providers within the scope of the existing EU Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive. “These proposals include a measure which would require the platforms to undertake due diligence when customers exchange virtual currencies for real ones,” according to the European Parliament website. “This would end the anonymity associated with such exchanges.” EC Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis recently revealed that: The Commission reiterates the importance of ending anonymity associated with using digital currencies but it is not offering any technological means to do so. Dombrovskis wrote that “the Commission is not putting forward any measure regarding the blockchain technology.” Instead, it “is addressing some key players that are fully identified as companies providing the targeted services,” he revealed. He also clarified that some businesses are not targeted by the AML Directive. “Software or application providers for instance are not targeted by the Commission proposal,” he noted.

2016-11-23T19:00:31-04:00,University Teams Choose Between Bitcoin and Ethereum,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/university-choose-bitcoin-ethereum/,"San Francisco-based Kraken, partnering with The Economist, initiated an interesting case study with university MBA groups from around the globe. The teams from multiple universities were asked to submit investment proposals for bitcoin or ether for a chance to win $10,000. Also read: Blockchain’s 10 Millionth Wallet And ‘Not Looking Back’  The school teams have finished their proposals and now the voting begins. Based on a five-year investment cycle, the groups were asked what would they do if they had $1 million USD to invest in either bitcoin, ether or both. The proposals describe how much the MBAs would invest in each and why they would choose a particular direction. Kraken founder and CEO Jesse Powell said is firm is providing this learning environment for people to get a better grasp of digital assets.  “This competition is an opportunity for you guys to learn about digital assets and take what you’ve learned and develop a profitable digital asset investment strategy,” he explained to contestants. “We’re asking you to help us answer a question that has been hotly debated in the industry over the last year. Which is the digital asset of the future? Is it bitcoin, ethereum, or both?” The proposal contest asks the university groups to create a 2-3 minute video that beginners can understand, but which also demonstrates knowledge of investment skills. First place will win $10,000, second $5,000, third $3,000, and the “people’s choice” will win $3,000. MBA programs who participated include: the BYU Marriott School of Management, Creighton University, FIA Business School, Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, Tulane University, and much more. Each school provided a video and written explanation of the group’s choices. School have submitted proposals with video content and, after being reviewed, can receive anonymous votes here. Proposals were fascinating, with many of the school teams choosing a larger bitcoin investment over ether. The only programs that did not favor bitcoin were Porto Business School, Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Rutgers, and Ivey Business School at Western University.      For instance, Rutgers’ video and written proposal shows ether leading in final price over bitcoin based on the team’s regression model. The group went over the historical prices and forecast prices since the cryptocurrency’s inception. However, Rutgers believed both cryptocurrencies will fall by the wayside in the coming years.       “Although we do not believe in cryptocurrencies in the long run, there is significant potential for the underlying technology to be used to increase the efficiency and transparency of trade,” said the Rutgers team.  Most of the other MBAs’ case studies chose bitcoin as the choice investment over the next five years. The majority of schools gave bitcoin a 60-80% ratio over ethereum for multiple reasons. Team BYU chose 78% bitcoin over 22% ether with a $1M investment over the next five years. The reasons bitcoin was selected by BYU included security, liquidity, sentiment, supply, and other network effects.  “Allocating 78% to bitcoin and 22% to ether provides a better balance,” BYU’s investment proposal stated. “This midpoint approach has three distinct advantages. First, we allocate the majority of the funds in the higher ranked, proven asset. Second, we are still able to participate in the potential upside inherent in ether. Third, we diversify our portfolio as the two cryptocurrencies show no correlation.”  Overall, reading all the proposals and watching the case study videos can give beginners knowledge about these digital assets. That seems to be the primary goal for Kraken and The Economist — teaching the masses digital asset benefits through academic knowledge.  All the university team videos and full solution proposals can be viewed here.  What do you think about the investment solutions the student teams provided? What investment strategy would you choose?

Herman Gref also spoke about the benefits of virtual currencies during a presentation for a joint project with Google. Could there be more than meets the eye?
 Also read: Russian Govt Regulator Launches Blockchain Project with Sberbank During his presentation on the bank’s joint project with Google, Gref revealed that he had owned some bitcoin. Gref shared about how he had to hold on to some of his bitcoin for two and a half months before converting them to fiat currencies — dollars and rubles. He held on to the bitcoin and would only cash them out at a price that was satisfactory for him.  Gref was upfront about how he sees virtual currencies trading as a “game”. He talked about how he had speculated on different virtual currencies, converting them back and forth between fiats. He suggested that bitcoin would soon become part of Russian society:  Gref also commented that bitcoin was worth much more in the past, but now its price has dropped to about half. Only in April this year, Russia’s Deputy Finance Minister Alexei Moiseev was preparing to introduce legislation that would punish bitcoin users. The punishment would include jail terms of up to seven years, according to Bloomberg. Then, in October this year, Alexei Moiseev stated that: While there are still many backs-and-forths and disagreements in Russia when it comes to the legality or usage of bitcoin, all these could change in a matter of time.   With the blockchain project between Sberbank and the Federal Antimonopoly Service (FAS) and the about-face Moiseev took with his bitcoin legislation stance, it seems likely that Russia is about to welcome bitcoin with open arms. In fact, Gref’s positive views on bitcoin and blockchain technology towards the future developments of Russian banking system may have been a contributing factor in the Russian authorities’ rethink bitcoin and its technology.

2016-11-23T08:00:36-04:00,RSK Lab Releases First Bitcoin Smart Contracts Testnet,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/rsk-releases-turmeric-testnet/,"Turmeric is the RSK testnet network that offers developers and business solution creators a fast, decentralized, bitcoin-secured ecosystem to test any smart contract application and tool they can dream of. RSK Lab, a.k.a Rootstock, released Turmeric on 23 November 2016. Also Read: How Should We Prepare Smart Contracts to Replace Law Firms? RSK is the only Turing-complete platform to run smart contracts that use the Bitcoin network. In effect, Bitcoin miners mine both blockchains simultaneously. Thus, the platform is not only safe but also fast. According to Gabriel Kurman, co-founder & investor relations at RSK Labs and CEO of Koinbanx, the RSK virtual machine can perform transactions six times faster than its competing machine, Ethereum. “Turmeric is backed by around 5 Petahashes from Bitcoin miners that are running the merge-mining plugins that were developed for CKPool, Eloipool and Stratum-mining software pools,” stated the press release on Turmeric’s launch. Specifically, the network is the first public release, which incorporates innovative features that are central to RSK’s core components: Additionally, RSK provides a virtual machine that is Ethereum compatible. According to the press release, “The RSK virtual machine is compatible with the Solidity compiler, meaning that any Ethereum developer can smoothly port his/her applications to RSK.” Consequently, Turmeric will greatly facilitate the creation of smart contract solutions for financial inclusion, the Internet of Things, and pure democracy applications. In particular, Turmeric will be useful for testing crowdfunding, crowdsourcing, and microfinancing solutions, while providing full transparency, said Kurman. To facilitate merge mining, RSK created open source plug-ins for the most important mining pool software programs, such as Ckpool, Eloipool, Coiniumserv, and Slushpool. In the process of building these plug-ins, the RSK team conducted extensive comparative research about mining pool software performance. As a result, Sergio Lerner, RSK Lab founder and Bitcoin security consultant, said the team is now able to confirm that merge mining does not affect the performance of Bitcoin mining. Already, a significant number of miners are already performing testing merge mining with RSK. “There are currently miners representing 30% of the Bitcoin network hashing power testing RSK merge mining, while another 40% have already expressed their support to the project and will start the merge-mining before the end of the year,” indicated the press release. The RSK Lab team is already planning to release Ginger, the first Mainnet version of the RSK platform, in May 2017. Ginger will be the only production network providing democratic open access, said Kurman. RSK expects to embrace more than 50 percent of Bitcoin global hashing power merge mining. Moreover, the Ginger release will include more than 300 full nodes with reward programming in place. Moreover, RSK is bringing innovative and important security features, such as minimum gas price, storage rent, and contract hibernation. RSK is the first platform that features storage rent. This feature allows a user to create an account or contract that prevents the user from keeping the storage forever. So, a user will have to regularly pay a small amount of gas to keep that storage. Otherwise, the content in that storage will disappear. Storage rent, for example, eliminates spam. As a buffer, in case the user forgets to pay the rent on time, contract hibernation into a single hash would take effect. To further increase the smart contracts ecosystem security, RSK has formed the Federation. Already, several leading Bitcoin exchanges and wallets are interested in joining the Federation. Participants in the Federation will provide essential services such as external security checkpoints, governance, instant liquidity, multisig, and oracling services. Additionally, the company is implementing the Ambassadors Program and invites the world Bitcoin community to participate. The Ambassadors Program is a global network of Smart Contracts experts, where participants can network, exchange ideas, and develop new projects. Some of the primary objectives of the Ambassadors Program include making every bitcoiner worldwide aware that smart contracts are available over the Bitcoin blockchain and promoting the development of smart contracts real use cases. By releasing Turmeric, RSK has reached a significant milestone in its efforts to unify the blockchain ecosystem, while undertaking initiatives to propel Bitcoin technology to its full potential. And, to level the playing field. As Kurman put it, “Smart Contracts puts kids working in a garage in equal conditions as big banks.” What are your thoughts about merge mining?

2016-11-22T10:00:14-04:00,Online Wallet iPayYou Adds Bitcoins to Amazon Shopping,Nanok Bie,https://news.bitcoin.com/ipayyou-bitcoin-amazon-shopping/,"Online wallet provider iPayYou is adding the option to pay with bitcoin when shopping on Amazon, promising a more “direct” and user-friendly process than similar offerings from competitors such as Gyft or Egifter. Also read: Amazon Reveals Its Own Virtual Currency, ‘Stream+’ For Twitch For years people have dreamed about Amazon announcing its acceptance of bitcoin as a payment method, but until that happens several companies are trying to add that mechanism. Seattle-based iPayYou may have managed to produce the smoothest and simplest process yet. iPayYou is using a similar “digital gift card” route as its competitors but with fewer hoops to jump through. On iPayYou’s web page there are options to send and receive bitcoins, to top up funds from a bank account and to send money to an email address, a twitter handle or a bitcoin address. The recipient needs no prior knowledge about bitcoin to receive them, and his/her funds are displayed in USD all through iPayYou’s site. When Bitcoin.com tried its features the online wallet performed flawlessly, including the “send-to-twitter” feature. iPayYou tweets a claim link to the recipient. The recipient needs to register an account with iPayYou to claim the transfer (see the adjacent screenshot, where Bitcoin.com COO Mate Tokay received a few bits by way of iPayYou). This built-in feature could have some viral effects; it may be a convincing experience to receive bitcoins via one’s Twitter account if new to the currency. The new “Amazon Direct” feature fits iPayYou’s general aim to “make bitcoin simple”. In the background iPayYou actually buys digital gift card balances via ACI, a Washington-based company, and transfers those fiat balances from its own Amazon account onto the user’s personal account at Amazon. This is only evident when checking the transaction history at Amazon. iPayYou takes care of the conversion from fiat (USD) to bitcoin, but does not lock in the USD balance (the USD balance will change as the BTC exchange rate fluctuates). That feature is coming soon, said iPayYou. Disregarding what goes on under the hood, the user experience is a straightforward one. It’s just like transferring “regular” money from one bank account to another. The process takes about 15-30 seconds (so, almost “direct”). “We’ve removed a lot of complexity compared to other options,” CEO Gene Kavner said in an interview with Bitcoin.com. “We actually transfer funds from iPayYou’s bank account to Amazon. They don’t even know it’s bitcoin.” Although not officially approved, endorsed or supported by Amazon itself, iPayYou follows all Amazon:s policies, Kavner added. In fact, Amazon has put a stop to some earlier attempts at providing the same mechanism. Notable among them was Paycoin’s effort in 2014. But Kavner says those past actions from Amazon should not worry iPayYou users. He also compared it to the fact that competitor Purse is offering its customers discounts (currently around 15%) when shopping there – a practice frowned upon at the giant e-retailer, as Amazon wants to stay in control over its pricing. “We’ve been very careful with the brand,” Kavner said. “We do not discount the Amazon brand, in accordance with Amazon policies. We’re not touching the Amazon site, replacing buttons with javascript or similar like some earlier attempts (such as PayCoin) tried to do”. However there are some fees involved. iPayYou charges 1% per transaction, minimum 1 USD, plus the network fee (around 0.13 USD at the time of writing). For example, a 16.95 USD purchase would deduct 18.08 USD from your iPayYou account (for a total fee of approx. 7%). When sending to a Twitter account iPayYou wanted 0.29 USD to transfer 5 USD (approx. 6%). However, if you’re willing to accept the fees, iPayYou’s process was at the time of writing less convoluted than some alternative services, as we found out when we went through the hoops to try them. What do you think about the new options at iPayYou? Let us know in the comments below. Images courtesy of iPayYou, Twitter, Shutterstock Have you seen our new widget service?

Also read: Did Barclays Just Declare War on Bitcoin Users? The company, based in the country’s second city Birmingham, is still among the first movers in an environment comparatively slow to catch on to digital currency. “With the increase in interest in bitcoin, we’ve had several clients (mostly tech ones) ask if we did accept bitcoin,” CEO Matthew Day told Bitcoin.com. “We have also had some interest around international work and barriers are a lot lower (and quicker) when dealing with bitcoin versus bank transfers or PayPal.” In Front Digital offers SEO and PPC services as part of its full service marketing package, all of which can now be paid for in bitcoin. In a press release issued Monday, the company indicated it had been eyeing bitcoin’s progress among merchants for some time prior to making a decision to come on board.  “We have been following the trend and usage of cryptocurrencies over the past 18 months and see bitcoin is gaining in strength, popularity and use,” Day explained. Research into bitcoin’s full potential to help business process does not stop at pleasing tech clients. The past few years have seen startups demonstrate how the virtual currency can easily be used to streamline not just merchant payments, but a raft of internal processes, which Day is keenly aware of. “I would prefer to keep the money in bitcoin due to safety from inflation but I will convert some to pay for expenses, such as company running costs, as although the amount of places taking bitcoin is increasing, we are still for the most part restricted to the banking system,” he continued. He added he would “welcome the day” that he could pay staff salaries in bitcoin. Unlike many businesses which use merchant providers such as BitPay or Coinbase to accept payments, Day is going it alone. Indeed, long term he considers it prudent to maintain a maximum amount of BTC profit in its original format. “I think it is safer to keep it in bitcoin rather than fiat currencies,” he said. “I haven’t really used merchant support infrastructure too much but I am aware of sites like BitPay and others.” The UK is currently shaping up to be a mixed environment for cryptocurrency and businesses that deal in it. While government schemes appear to broadly support disruptive fintech, recent moves from the country’s banks demonstrate a lack of understanding on legislation and liability.

2016-11-20T12:00:12-04:00,Do Bitcoin and Chinese Yuan Values Correlate?,Kei K,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-chinese-yuan-correlate/,"The price of the Chinese yuan against the U.S. dollar has gained more attention from bitcoin enthusiasts and speculators lately. They’ve held on to their belief that the bitcoin price is in close correlation with the value of CNY. How does bitcoin and CNY correlate in a quantitative term? Could it be a sheer coincidence? Also read: Bitcoin’s Price Value Eyes More Gains The financial markets have been a rollercoaster ride in the past months. Historical events like the ‘Brexit’ and the IMF’s addition of Chinese yuan into its SDR basket of reserve currencies have shaken up the world of economics. The U.S. presidential election also brought very pleasant surprises for bitcoin enthusiasts — bitcoin value has gone from strength to strength. CNY has also broken new floors now and then, as President-elect Donald Trump plans to renegotiate trade deals with China.  Curiosity as to how closely bitcoin and Chinese yuan values correlate have sent bitcoin enthusiasts like me to find out. According to Bloomberg’s report nearly a month ago, Dr Le Xia, chief economist for Asia at BBVA Research, stated that China would intervene to stabilize its currency. However, the situation has changed since. Banks lowered their yuan forecast as President-Elect Trump threatens tariffs on China’s domestic goods. Trump’s labeling of China as a “currency manipulator” has also sent the CNY into a downward spiral. Morgan Stanley estimated as much as $44bn of net capital outflow from China in September. The country’s holdings of U.S. Treasuries also declined to $1.157 trillion in the same month. Chinese officials have stepped in to “fill” the capital control loopholes. One such action is to come up with a potential plan to curb transactions that use bitcoin and other digital currencies to take funds out of the country. The correlation coefficient calculation can be used to determine how variables such as bitcoin and Chinese yuan correlate with each other. These are the considerations during calculation:  The result shows how closely bitcoin and CNY correlate — it turned out to be 0.57871. This reading indicates that bitcoin and Chinese Yuan correlate moderately positive with each other.  Before anyone starts to jump into punting on bitcoin price movements based on this correlation coefficient finding, it is important to note: The good news: speculators could use the findings of how bitcoin and Chinese yuan correlate as a reference to how their bitcoin trading positions would be. In summary: Anticipating bitcoin movements remains a challenge, as it is largely based on its demand and supply in the open market. Even though the result shows that bitcoin and Chinese yuan correlate positively by 0.57871, caution when using such finding is highly advised.

The company has been deliberating ways to continue the service, but unfortunately, in the end, it said the only option was to shut down. Also read: IRS Fail: Treasury Audit Says it Can’t Manage Virtual Currencies  Founded in December of 2014 by Nick Sullivan, the company ChangeCoin created its first platform ChangeTip. Since the application started, it has processed 350,000 bitcoin tips across the web and had roughly 100,000 users. People could tip bitcoin throughout many social media platforms including Reddit, Facebook, Twitter and more.  This past April ChangeTip’s employees were acqui-hired by Airbnb, and the original staff is currently employed by the company. It hasn’t been officially stated what the employees do for Airbnb, but ChangeTip founder Nick Sullivan assured the public ChangeTip users’ data would not be sold.  “At the end of November 2016, all tipping functionality will be deactivated, and the site will be put into a withdrawal-only mode for people to collect their funds,” explains ChangeTip during the announcement. “The site will remain up for a number of months to allow users to withdraw their funds, and we will be reaching out to users to notify them. We recommend you close your ChangeTip account. You may withdraw any remaining funds via BTC withdrawal, or you can donate your funds to charity.”   ChangeTip explains the team has explored “dozens” of options but realistically the service had to close. The post mentioned monthly server costs, customer support, and necessary site costs but no great detail to why the service will end. The company say the withdrawal-only mode should be up on the site for a “couple months.” Furthermore, once a user closes their account ChangeTip explained all user data will be deleted.  ChangeTip’s news met with disappointment from the cryptocurrency world. Some have questioned why the business shut down operations since starting a new wallet service last February. Others in the community have questioned whether the problem with sending microtransactions was an issue for ChangeTip. However, the company hasn’t confirmed any operational issues or finance problems. Across the top three cryptocurrency subreddits, some showed little surprise and also questioned the company’s funding of $3.5 million. Other cryptocurrency community members said they found little use for the application while some think a new platform will arise. One user writes, “It wouldn’t surprise me if some form of internet tipping emerges eventually, especially when people get more used to zapping money around on their phones one way or another.”  ChangeTip will be missed by many in the community. As an alternative, there is ProTip — created by developer Chris Ellis and which operates in a similar fashion. ChangeTip says the time spent as a company has been a great adventure and they are proud of the accomplishments.  “We sincerely hope you enjoyed using ChangeTip. Please continue to spread the mission of generosity, gratitude, and appreciation all over the web.”  What do you think about ChangeTip closing its doors? Let us know in the comments below.

The event will discuss the what lies ahead concerning legislative and legal architecture for the virtual currency industry.   Also read: Dubai Establishes Gov’t Backed ‘Blockchain Council’ Dubai’s SLC, in collaboration with the Dubai Electronic Security Center (DESC), will present a session workshop dedicated to Bitcoin awareness. The SLC has revealed many “high-level” local and federal government representatives from the region will be in attendance. Attendees will discuss the country’s goals of keeping the legal system parallel to these emerging technologies.  “The move is part of our continuing efforts to build a legal knowledge base in line with our strategic objectives in strengthening the legal system and developing the legislative process to achieve the objective and realistic requirements for drafting leading legislation that simulates reality and outlooks the future,” H.E. Ahmad bin Meshar Al Muhairi, the SLC secretary general explained.      The workshop agenda will be focused on ‘Legal and Legislative Frameworks of Virtual Currency at the International Level,’ says the SLC. The sessions will have speakers such as Dr Marwan Al Zarouni, Director of Information Services at Dubai Electronic Security Center. Al Zarouni will discuss the basics of virtual currency and highlight the many attributes of cryptocurrency. The premise will detail the ‘Definition and Origin of Virtual Currency,’ and how they will interact with local and international cyber security law. The workshop will be “in line with the wise guidance of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai,” says the SLC secretary general. The SLC believes virtual currency, although nascent, is not new and spreading awareness helps push forth innovation. The organization says there is an “urgent need” to highlight bitcoin awareness as it is the first of its kind and the most popular cryptocurrency worldwide. The SLC understands there are great differences than traditional currencies and look forward to supporting nation-wide governance on this technology.  “This will acquaint them with the ways international law deals with ‘bitcoin’, which is now officially recognized worldwide due to the accelerated pace of the smart transformation,” stated H.E. Bin Meshar.  DESC also believes spreading knowledge about virtual currencies forwards progress and development. H.E. Yousef Al Shaibani, DESC Executive Director, said the security centre entity would provide ongoing support towards these matters of building infrastructure. H.E. Al Shaibani stressed that informing legislative and financial sectors about virtual currency and blockchain provides improved cooperation. “This reflects our belief that the emirate of Dubai and the United Arab Emirates should be among the first in the region and the world to establish a legislative framework and a financial and organizational structure for this technology, with the participation of all competent authorities in the emirate and the UAE,”  H.E. Al Shaibani added. Dubai has always been forward thinking when it comes to technology. The subject of blockchain and cryptocurrencies is no different as authorities are bolstering these innovations. Back in August, the country showed its commitment to blockchain research and development by investing one billion dirham ($275 million USD) into acceleration programs.   “Under the directives of our leadership, we look forward to a new phase in the development of our national economy,” explained Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum of Dubai. Dubai has also hosted its Blockchain Technology Conference in Burj Al Arab, showcasing the many attributes of these protocols. With the Dubai’s accelerator program and the upcoming SLC Bitcoin workshop, it shows leaders from the region want in on this new economy.  What do you think about Dubai’s SLC Bitcoin workshop?

Currently, at press time the price is averaging $745. If it reaches $790, it will peak past this summer’s high before the Bitfinex hack. Also read: A Glimpse at Nodio, the Blockchain-Based Router On November 17 bitcoin touched $750, making the total bitcoin market capitalization just above $12 billion.The price has dipped a touch and is slowly working through heavier resistance at the moment. Technical indicators show on both the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 200 SMA that the price will keep testing higher. Unless selling pressure picks up, the price could very well crest towards $790-800 per BTC in the next few days.  This week has been perfect for intra-range traders and those who love volatility. Over the course of the week the price has been bumpy, moving back and forth between $685 and $710. However, on November 16 the fiat value shot up from the low $700s to $730 per BTC. Following this feat, on the morning of the 17th the price tapped the $750 mark, and enthusiasts were thrilled. Of course, speculative rumors point to China’s yuan devaluation and India’s recent currency ban. News has been relatively good for the decentralized currency since our last price trend report. One of the biggest stories of the week comes from India as Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared large-denomination rupees illegal. This has caused cash shortages and volatile markets throughout India. Many people within the cryptocurrency community have been pushing the idea that residents from India should look to bitcoin. It seems some residents might be listening, as the value of gold has risen in the region and bitcoin prices have been $100 higher than many exchanges worldwide.  The world’s most popular wallet and blockchain explorer firm Blockchain recently announced a partnership with Coinify. Now Blockchain users will be able to purchase bitcoin in-wallet with either a credit card or tethered bank account. The company has been having an extremely successful month as Blockchain approaches 10 million registered bitcoin wallets.  Furthermore, the U.S. election finally ended with Donald Trump defeating Hillary Clinton in the presidential race. The outcome sent shockwaves throughout global markets including bitcoin, as the price shot up 5% following the results. With the Trump transition approaching, many wonder how his administration will be towards fintech and digital currencies. At press time there has been a slight downtrend, but overall candle charts look bullish. The price definitely had some bumps in the road reaching this price point, and the price is expected to continue to be choppy. Intra-range and day traders will do well in this environment, and projections show $780-800 is attainable.   Bear Scenario: Term support seems to be holding firm above $700 if the price corrects it should floor around this range. Bitcoin has shown over the past three-weeks that these highs could see quick shorts as well and bear traps.  Bull Scenario: Buying doesn’t seem to be slowing up as trading volume is heavy at $131 million USD worth of BTC being traded daily. Ascending channel patterns show the price path pushing towards $780-800 if nothing dreadful happens these next few days. Traders should always be reminded that when the price is high, they should use extreme caution holding reserves on exchanges.

Also read: US Slowly Going Cash-Free, But Where’s the Bitcoin? A week ago, the Indian government suddenly withdrew the country’s 500 and 1000 rupee bills from circulation. Now, bitcoin is experiencing a knee-jerk reaction among citizens concerned about their financial integrity.  Interest in bitcoin and also purchases of it have spiked in India, with buyers quoted huge mark-ups on sites such as Localbitcoins to convert their rupees. Entrepreneur Tuur Demeester noted earlier this week how such ‘premiums’ are topping 13% compared to average market rates per bitcoin. While they were present before, sources say, the cash debacle has served to intensify the situation.  The government demonetized India’s larger notes, which have a combined value equal to 86% of all circulating cash in the country. The policy aim is to replace them with new 500 and 2000 denominations which will be less easy to forge. With this in mind, Steven McKie of Purse.io suggested panic may be short lived, but the allure of bitcoin for those who made a partial transition now will remain enticing. In September, Purse partnered with Indian exchange Unocoin to bring discounted purchases to Indian bitcoin holders, and has seen the market become the second busiest after the US.  “This shift, in my personal opinion, translates to citizens in India having to look for quick alternatives,” McKie told Bitcoin.com in emailed comments. “Even once things have died down somewhat and the initial shock wears off with the removal of the notes, those that have adopted bitcoin won’t go back.” On the topic of Bitcoin purchase options locally, he added that uncertainty could spur consumers to “take a hit” in order to safeguard their savings in the long term. “[W]hen faced with no other options, I am sure people are willing to take a hit to know that at least some portion of their wealth is safeguarded,” he continued. “The people of India are very intelligent and savvy, I am sure they are doing their homework prior to buying in. “In times of hardship, you do what you have to in order to get by, by any means necessary. And, that means is bitcoin.” Meanwhile, further war-on-cash-style noises have come from Australia, a country now toying with the concept of eliminating cash altogether within just eight years. Earlier this week, a report by investment bank UBS stated a desire to see the country’s two largest notes — 50 and 100 AUD — disappear even earlier. “We believe removing large denomination notes in Australia would be good for the economy and good for the banks,” it said. Similar to India, these two notes account for 92% of cash value in circulation.  At the same time, Citibank announced that it would go ‘cashless’ at some of its Australian branches.

To set the record straight, “freelancing” is not a word of convenience for the unemployed group who refuse to step into clockwork working society. Freelancers often have to go through qualifying rounds before getting freelance work. Therefore, more often than not, they are the ones with the self-discipline and passion for the work style they chose. Traditionally, there has always been a positive correlation between productivity and the employment rate. However, this may no longer be the case. The birth of Internet and other technologies benefited individuals and economies significantly. Efficiency, convenience and productivity all increased. However, they do not come without negatives. One of these is “technological unemployment”: i.e.: technological progress increased economic growth by accelerating productivity and output levels — paradoxically at the cost of employment rates within specific sectors. Nonetheless, in part, the term technological unemployment may have been exaggerated. Many individuals grew fond of technology, and recognize that flexibility and adaptability are crucial. Therefore they begin to pick up new skills and learn the technical know-how to ensure a place in the workforce. The rise of startups leveraging the power of the decentralized internet, concurrent to the development of blockchain applications, have helped to redefine remote work as an acceptable norm lately. Thus, it did not come as a surprise that most freelancers came from the financial, technology, software and recruitment industries. Bitcoin provides economic liberty for the unbanked as it goes where the big banks deem troublesome. For the billions of people who are unbanked, freelancing and bitcoin pull talent and banking together instantly. Also, most freelancers do not get to enjoy retirement schemes, and their insurance payments are mostly out-of-pocket. Therefore, the mode by which they receive their wages could make a difference. The concept of freelancing and bitcoin together are gaining popularity in every part of the world. Platforms like XBTFreelancer, BitLancerr, and Fiverr (to name a few) gave rise to freelancing and bitcoin as income rewards. These platforms that marry freelancers and hirers seem to place all parties in a win-win situation- Fees are usually no more than 10 percent*, halving that of a fiat payment freelancing site, e.g.: XBTFreelance vs. UpWork.
 This savings average out to higher hourly wages for the freelancer. Assurance from escrow features and removal of risks from credit card information theft are among the many attractive factors. One man’s meat is another’s poison: while some love the possibility of their earnings doubling in the next few months, others have second thoughts about that.  Freelancing and bitcoin are not all that risky. Users can rely on less volatile altcoins as a hedge, options and futures trading to cushion volatility are also available. If cashing out bitcoin into fiat currency seems inconvenient and pricey in some regions, there are websites like MyDish, Quantified, Bylls, coinsfer, and others. Also, don’t forget the many bitcoin-accepting merchants online. Card providers such as WageCan allow freelancing and bitcoin to co-exist in freelancers’ favor. Unlike some card providers, selling bitcoin prior to needing fiat money is not necessary. Bitcoins are only converted, based close on real-time exchange rates, at points-of-sale or ATM withdrawals.  Thus freelancers can better manage their finances and only utilise bitcoin as a payment method when the value of bitcoin is to their favor. Freelancing and bitcoin have, and will continue to, disrupt employment — but in a positive way. Whether one is in a cash-strapped situation or has the need to feel richer, the escalating growth in this new bitcoin economy is ready to do wonders for you. Are you part of this freelancing and bitcoin economy? If so, what are your thoughts? If no, share with us what could have been stopping you.

2016-11-16T21:00:55-04:00,Could Bitcoin Break the Petrodollar Monopoly and Bring World Peace?,Kei K,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-break-petrodollar-monopoly-peace/,"Could bitcoin bring world peace by disrupting the current economic order, but while also reviving the U.S. economy? To answer, we must look at oil and the existing “petrodollar monopoly”.
 Also read: As the Global Economy Falters, bitcoin Offers an Alternative for Prosperity According to one study, “capitalism is an economic structure; war is a political act”. It shows how retaining the petrodollar monopoly serves the Federal Reserve’s interests, even at the expense of peace for countries such as the U.S., Iran, or China. The term “petrodollar monopoly” refers to the exclusive use of U.S. dollars as the pillar that upholds the banking cartel’s economic power. To regain its dollar monopoly after the historic Bretton Woods Agreement collapsed in 1971, the U.S. struck a deal with Saudi Arabia. The petrodollar was formed as oil was sold exclusively in dollars, and surpluses were held in U.S. debt securities. In return, the U.S. provided arms and protection.  Many on both sides of U.S. politics find this relationship unsavory, claiming it often runs counter to American interests and even causes conflict. The petrodollar and the Bretton Woods Agreement alike caused economic strain, especially for developing countries like China. With turnover volumes from domestic exports and oil imports, holding on to depreciating U.S. debt securities begun to make less economic sense for China. To ease the pressurizing situation, China contemplated moving away from the dollar monopoly, or lowering its production costs. Let’s look at some interesting events from the past few years. While they may seem unrelated at first, they may combine to have implications for both the dollar and bitcoin. There are more risks to the U.S. dollar than just losing prestige from China’s trade activities. The IMF’s effort to loosen China’s control over the yuan essentially creates a new trading currency for the rest of the world. The devaluation of the Chinese yuan may have lured the Chinese into bitcoin and caused its value to spike. But it may not be the key motivator. If China’s capital controls were the main cause for bitcoin price hike, the IMF’s efforts would have eased it. But it did not. Let’s assume that bitcoin could be deployed as a tool in international oil trading activities. The price hike could reflect efforts to meet the daily global turnover needs i.e. An aggregated “petro-bitcoin” value of around US$4.6 billion* equivalents. Would this make a sound explanation for the spike?
*US$4.6 billion: [94 mil barrels x Average annual OPEC crude oil price 2015 at $49.49] At first glance, the precedent risks and the idea of a “petro-bitcoin” appear to be all-cons for the U.S. economy. Especially when bitcoin’s anonymity could encourage any country plotting to displace the dollar monopoly to do it surreptitiously, without souring relationships. However, it is noteworthy that this feature also allows the U.S. and others — who may not have already established friendlier ties with China — to start investing in Chinese yuan heavily.   The key factor is that bitcoin knows no “owner”. Regardless if it is China (or any other countries) as the driving forces behind the idea of “petro-bitcoin”, the main concern is described below. In the event the U.S. Federal Reserve’s dollar “zeroizes” and the “Great Global Reset” occurs, countries’ weakened oil purchasing power will result in less than optimal production abilities; hence prolonging a recession. During the gloom, bitcoin prices (just like gold prices) will likely surge. With the intervention of “petro-bitcoin”, every country would enjoy continuity in their economic activities despite dollar “zeroizing”. The anonymity helps to put aside “capitalism and war” — thus bringing world peace and a focus on global economy recovery.  To conclude, these perils would starve the Federal Reserve rather than the U.S. economy. A global “petro-bitcoin” could be preferable due to its neutrality — just like unbiased blockchain technology — and capable of pulling the U.S. or any country through rough economic times. It would also serve to prevent dangerous alliances and unnecessary conflict. Don’t you think it is about time that the U.S. acknowledges bitcoin’s role as a savior, rather than a disturbing risk?

2016-11-16T02:00:58-04:00,Bitcoin Enthusiast Peter Thiel Joins Trump Transition Team,Elizabeth McCauley,https://news.bitcoin.com/peter-thiel-trump-transition-team/,"Just last week, Donald Trump was elected the 45th President of the United States of America in an electoral upset and unexpected victory against his opponent, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. In his first week as President-Elect, Trump started forming his transition team. On Friday, he officially added Peter Thiel  to the team. What does this mean for the tech community, and specifically Bitcoin advocates? Also read: “Trump’s Trade War With China Could Boost Chinese Bitcoin Demand” To some, Silicon Valley is a hotspot for liberals. However, Peter Thiel, Co-Founder of PayPal and venture capitalist, stands out. Thiel recently joined the Republican Party after identifying as a libertarian for the majority of his adult life. He not only identifies with Republican and libertarian causes but contributes financially as well. Thiel is also known for his early angel investment in Facebook back in 2004 and his role in Founder’s Fund, which has investments in companies including Lyft and Airbnb.  Thiel took a larger step onto the US political scene this summer when he addressed the Republican Party Convention in Cleveland, Ohio. You can watch his full speech here. Perhaps Thiel’s most noteworthy quote addressed Donald Trump’s outsider stance on politics. Thiel stated, “I am not a politician, but neither is Donald Trump.” In 2013, Thiel made a grand entrance into the Bitcoin space through his early seed investment in BitPay, a global payment processor. PayPal also partnered with BitPay, Coinbase and GoCoin to enable Bitcoin payment acceptance for PayPal’s Payment Hub. Thiel is known for his fellow’s program. In 2014, Vitalik Buterin, founder of Ethereum, was selected as a fellow. Thiel fellows include Gary Le of Zcoin and Joey Krug of Augur who are working on blockchain related projects. Thiel’s Fellows Program not only provides funding for these projects but also provides opportunities for mentorship.  Thiel sees the merit of Bitcoin but also provides a mixed perspective on bitcoin as a mechanism for payment.  In 2015 at the Buttonwood Summit he stated:  Thiel has repeatedly expressed the need for solid infrastructure around bitcoin as a currency. It will be interesting to see how he will help shape the team who will advise the newly elected president on tech policy and perhaps even cryptocurrency.  So what do you think? Do you view Peter Thiel’s role on the presidential transition team as a positive for Bitcoin and blockchain technology? Do you view the Trump administration as open to cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?

2016-11-15T12:00:39-04:00,Memphis Residents Now Have Their First Bitcoin ATM,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/memphis-first-bitcoin-atm/,"The city of Memphis will now have a Bitcoin ATM as the firm Coinsource installs three new machines in the state of Tennessee. The company is the largest Bitcoin ATM provider in the U.S. and has averaged over one installation per week in 2016.     Memphis, in Tennessee’s southwest, will get its first Bitcoin automated teller machine. Additionally, the company Coinsource installed two Bitcoin ATMs in the city of Nashville. Coinsource has established 60 Genesis Coin brand cryptocurrency ATM across the U.S. since its inception. “The demand for bitcoin ATMs has never been higher than it is today. The most rewarding part of our job is to answer the call when requests come in for new locations, so it is exciting to make history in Tennessee,” said Coinsource CEO and co-founder Sheffield Clark. “Our reach in the South is growing. So far, we have 60 machines across eight states, and look forward to gaining a foothold in even more new cities around the country.” According to Coin ATM Radar, there are 482 installed Bitcoin ATMs throughout the United States. Coinsource, which Clark founded in February 2015, owns a large share of these devices. Bitcoin ATMs have provided people with easier access to cryptocurrency using cash. Additionally, with an automated teller machine that dispenses bitcoin all users need is a wallet to store the funds.  Coinsource says its mission is to make “buying and selling bitcoin as immediate and natural as withdrawing or depositing fiat from a traditional ATM.” The company claims it has first-class customer support and some of the lowest transaction fees in the market. The company aims to continue to be a forerunner amongst American Bitcoin ATM providers and will soon reveal its blueprint for international expansion. The startup details the initial focus will be on countries in South America, Europe and Africa.       The first Bitcoin ATM in Memphis will be at 967 Linden Avenue within the downtown district. The two Nashville Coinsource machines are installed in Z-Marts near the Nashville International Airport, and the other north of the city center. People looking to use the devices can easily get directions from the Coinsource website, or Coin ATM Radar maps. Clark added:   Clark said due to the price rise over the past few months, there has been significant demand for bitcoin. Bitcoin ATMs will fuel this by giving people access to the cryptocurrency without needing a bank account. He believes bitcoin is a solid investment vehicle, and is pleased to offer alternative methods of buying and selling the digital currency.   “The valuation of bitcoin has risen sharply in November, and surprising election results have caused traditional market uncertainty, prompting many experts to forecast an influx of cryptocurrency adoption. Many thousands of Americans have begun to realize that bitcoin is becoming a stable payment option and a lucrative form of investment as well,” concluded Clark.

A recent piece from Business Insider informs us how this affected Bitcoin’s biggest wallet provider Blockchain in a very positive way. In fact, the company is having its best month ever. Also read:Trump Vs Clinton: Bitcoin Illiteracy in 2016 Presidential Election Blockchain is bitcoin’s biggest wallet provider, with over 8 million wallets in over 120 countries. Co-founder and CEO Peter Smith spoke to Business Insider about how the U.S. presidential election has increased activity in the platform. Based in London, Blockchain employs roughly 25 people but still owns over 50% of the market. In the past, it has raised over $30 million from investors. According to Smith, this is the first month where “millions and millions of people” used their wallet, as they saw their biggest increase on election day. Blockchain will soon allow people to buy and sell bitcoin from within their wallets. The new feature has been under development for roughly 8 months, and is thanks to a partnership with Danish bitcoin startup Coinify. With Blockchain’s position in the wallet market and recent surge of users, this feature is expected to increase activity on the platform – even more than the elections. People invest in safe haven assets like gold or silver whenever the market is down. According to Smith, Bloomberg recently registered bitcoin as one of those assets. Essentially, people are turning to bitcoin in order to hedge against economic instability, as stocks crashed after Donald Trump was elected to become the 45th president of the United States of America. For thousands of years, gold has been the safe haven people go to whenever the market is down. That may be about to change, as bitcoin is encroaching on gold’s turf, even though a lot of people don’t see it as a safe haven. Both gold and bitcoin have no ties to any government, both have a very limited supply, and both have value. While gold’s value is determined by its properties, bitcoin’s value is determined by its features. The law of supply and demand has a huge influence on the price of bitcoin and gold. Therefore, when the market crashed and demand surged, bitcoin’s price rose to nearly $740, even though it came back down soon after. Is bitcoin really conquering gold’s turf?

According to a recent editorial from the African Mail & Guardian, some economists are suggesting bitcoin as an alternative. Also read: Ontario Securities Commission Hosts Fintech Hackathon Since the year 2000, Zimbabwe’s economy has suffered through a deep economic recession. The country has experienced widespread poverty and exponentially high unemployment rates. The government abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar in 2009 due to hyperinflation, and has been suffering from cash shortages. One economist from the region, Phillip Haslam, believes bitcoin could give Zimbabwe’s economy a boost. Bitcoin is a stable asset not backed by a corporate entity or central bank, and has gained attention across the African continent. Haslam said that bitcoin, alongside fixing fluctuations in cross-border trade, could be the answer.  “We are very excited about bitcoin as a stable currency alternative. The thing about bitcoin is once you import it into the country, you don’t have the problem of the currency eroding and perishing like you have with notes. It’s a system that allows for privatized banking. Effectively, the bitcoin system is both a currency and international payments platform,” explained Haslam.  This past October Bitcoin.com reported on BitMari, the Pan-African Bitcoin wallet provider trying to push cryptocurrency adoption. The company raised money for the Zimbabwe Women Farmers Accelerator and used Bitcoin to fund the effort. The project is a collaboration with the organization Agribank and the Women Farmers Land and Agriculture Trust. One resident from Zimbabwe has been saving $35 per transaction by using Bitcoin for remittances. According to William Suk, he saves money on fees and can make a small profit from time to time as well. Suk describes an arbitrage scenario where he buys bitcoin and sends it to his family through an EcoCash account.   “I have been using bitcoin to send money to Zimbabwe for more than a year in order to save money on fees and make a small profit on the exchange rate. As a result, I now use only about $275 to send $300 to my parents’ EcoCash account,” explained Suk in a blog post.   Quite a few people are concerned with the Zimbabwe economy and believe bitcoin could relieve some economic hardship. Since adopting a multi-currency system in 2009, the country’s cash shortages have affected nearly everyone. There are long lines at financial institutions, and many believe people are hoarding U.S. dollars. Alongside this, there is very little trust in the region’s banking practices. Bitcoin is a currency that is far more stable and has also risen dramatically in value over the past year. The cryptocurrency is also free from government intervention, and may reach higher levels of value due to its scarcity. Zimbabwe and citizens from many other countries around the globe are quickly realizing that bitcoin can be a safe haven, a crowdfunding tool, and a remittance application all in one.   What do you think about residents from Zimbabwe embracing Bitcoin?

2016-11-14T12:00:26-04:00,Bitcoin Mining Intensifies During Q4 of 2016,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-mining-intensifies-q4-2016/,"Bitcoin mining has become a serious and profitable industry. Over the past couple of years, the mining race to capture the last bitcoins has been on fire. Also read: Webjet & Microsoft Introduce Travel Industry Blockchain There’s a lot of discussions when it comes to the cryptocurrency network’s mining sector. Miners process transactions to gain freshly minted bitcoins and fees. In return, mining secures the network by confirming transactions included in blocks with mathematical proof-of-work.  Since Bitcoin’s inception, devices dedicated to mining have become more advanced and mining pools have been created. Large mining pools now exist including Antpool, Slush, F2Pool and more. Even Bitcoin.com has a mining pool that composes 1.7% of the Bitcoin network.  Now MGT Capital Investments has announced to its shareholders a successful second phase of its Washington state facility. This weekend the firm led by John McAfee said the mining operation was ahead of schedule. MGT Capital says its mining power has expanded to five petahash and is now a leader in the U.S. region. The firm announced it has mined over 170 bitcoins since it started two months ago.  “As we grow our Bitcoin footprint here, our expertise becomes an increasingly valuable resource as we enter into our upcoming joint venture with Bitmain Technologies of China, the preeminent worldwide leader in Bitcoin hardware manufacturing and sales,” said John McAfee, Executive Chairman of MGT.  Beijing-based Bitmain revealed it is building a new mining center in China. Bitmain is calling the complex a state-of-the-art facility that churns 135 megawatts of power. The firm believes once complete the mining center will be among the biggest operations in the world. In addition to this wind and solar will be utilized to run the location. Alternative resources have become a game changer within the bitcoin mining industry.   “We have seen that most data centers in the mining industry are wasting considerable money or other resources.  We want to provide a more professional and cost-saving example to the industry,” explained CEO Jihan Wu.     Bitmain has become a mining industry leader and hopes to expand with its partnership with the leverage MGT Capital offers as well. The Xinjiang mining facility already has 45 structures ready to go, and construction should be complete by the end of 2016. However, the firm is expecting a colder winter this season, and the Xinjiang facility may take longer. The Bitmain announcement has caused a discussion concerning mining algorithm changes to the Bitcoin network. The developer at SatoshiLabs and founder of the Slush Pool tweeted out to his followers an interesting statement.   The tweet was a hot topic in the Bitcoin community as many shared differing opinions on Twitter and various social forums. Changing the mining algorithm is a pretty hardcore change to the protocol. So the statement led to many different kinds of sentiment towards the specific algorithm topic, and spurred more block size conversations as well. One thing for sure is the Bitcoin mining industry has grown fast in a relatively short time. There are many players both new and old trying to compete together in this emerging market. New ASIC hardware and chips have become more advanced. Pools and facilities have become massive.  The community knows mining is integral to the network and its infrastructure ensures a secure environment. However, we don’t know how far the race will advance and how big these operations will get. Time will tell as many can envision wild cooling processes and future advancement in quantum computing. The Bitcoin mining industry isn’t slowing up anytime soon.

2016-11-14T06:00:51-04:00,Central Bank of Argentina Calls on the Bitcoin and Blockchain Community,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/central-bank-argentina-blockchain/,"The Central Bank of Argentina and government representatives have asked the Bitcoin community to join efforts to eradicate financial exclusion, transform the financial industry, promote financial opportunities, and reduce inflation. Officials made their request at the Latin America Bitcoin & Blockchain Conference (laBITconf), on November 5 in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Also read: Governments & Central Banks are Now Funding Blockchain Research Tiziano M. Di Biase coordinates Fintech activities at the Central Bank of Argentina. He participated in the panel “Blockchain and Hackathon” at laBITconf. During the panel discussion, Di Biase invited entrepreneurs and blockchain developers to take part in a hackathon. His intent was to show the Central Bank of Argentina how Bitcoin and blockchain technology could unleash new solutions to enable financial transformation. Because blockchain is a very attractive technology with enormous potential, many central banks around the world are scrutinizing it with keen interest. Therefore, said Di Biase, the Central Bank of Argentina could consider blockchain-based proposals in its agenda. Argentinean government officials also indicated their support for blockchain technology adoption. They asked the Bitcoin and blockchain community to work on their initiatives to exploit innovation, in order to propel economic growth and development. Silvia Torres Carbonell, Undersecretary of Creative Economy and Innovation of the Government of the City of Buenos Aires, participated in the panel “Modernization and Entrepreneurship in Argentina.” She said that in Argentina, until recently, there had been many enterprising initiatives, but few of these initiatives had integrated innovation. However, she remarked, Argentina is now experiencing a transformative and unique moment. Her office is promoting social development through programs such as IncuBate, IncuBA Tech, and IncuBA Social. According to Torres Carbonell, blockchain — like the internet and artificial intelligence — is a tool that has the potential to democratize all human activities and build a better future for all. Similarly, Rudi Bormann, Undersecretary of Public Innovation and Open Government, Argentina Presidency, participated in the panel “Modernization and Entrepreneurship in Argentina.” One of the goals of Bormann’s agency is to encourage innovation in the public sector. His office also leads the Open Data government initiative, which aims to facilitate access to information and improve government transparency. Bormann remarked that blockchain technology presents many opportunities to improve transparency and fight corruption. Additionally, Bormann explained that at the G20 in 2016, the Chinese delegation put forward a strategic document that promotes the Digital Economy.  Moreover Germany, which will head the group in 2017, plans to focus on digitalization to generate economic growth. In 2018, Argentina will host the G20. Argentina has already endorsed the G20 document on the digital economy. Therefore the digital economy, Bitcoin, and blockchain will be key G20 topics for the next three years, Bormann said. According to the World Bank, over two billion adults worldwide do not have access to banking and financial services. In Argentina, the unbanked population is significant. As of 2014, the number of unbanked adult Argentinians reached over 15 percent, according to the World Bank report “Universal Financial Access 2020.” Consequently, the Argentinean government and Central Bank authorities are focusing on finding innovative solutions. They play to achieve greater financial inclusion, transform the financial industry, promote financial opportunities, and reduce the inflation rate. Now the Central Bank of Argentina, the Ministry of Production, and the Innovation Ministry are organizing the “Financial Innovation Hackathon.” The event will take place in Buenos Aires on November 18-19, 2016. The central bank and government agencies are inviting students, professionals, economists, entrepreneurs, and in particular the Bitcoin and blockchain community. Argentina has significant advantages for achieving fintech innovation. For example, the country has high-level talent with creative potential and the required know-how. Indeed, in Argentina, several prominent startups are already creating amazing Bitcoin and blockchain-based solutions — such as RSK and Signatura.

Legalization has been a huge success, with interest growing continually. The election has only pushed legal pot further with California, Nevada and Massachusetts joining the party. The business does have a few problems, for which bitcoin may be the answer. Also read: Colorado Cannabis Operations Begin Banking With Bitcoin Even though individual states allow pot, it’s still an illegal drug — at least in the eyes of the Federal Government. As such, banking services remain unavailable to legal marijuana merchants. This means merchants usually work with cash only. Thieves can easily steal cash, it’s bulky to carry, and it can even cause paranoia in merchants’ minds. Credit cards, deposits and checks aren’t an option for dispensaries, so these businesses have to spend money on CCTV, large safes. Some even choose bullet-proof glass – they can never be too safe. Security expenses can add up and cut profitability, forcing these dispensaries to either find creative payment service solutions to solve their problems, or have a huge headache dealing with them. As we all know, bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that offers its users semi-anonymity and security. Transactions have an extremely low cost, and unless you get scammed or hacked, wallets are free and secure. Bitcoin’s nature makes it the perfect solution for these merchants. It isn’t bulky to carry, it’s not easy to steal, and it doesn’t need to be kept in an expensive safe. Businesses can convert bitcoin into dollars or any other currency, with the help of one of the many available exchanges. They can then freely use cash without having to blow away their profit. Companies all over the world are hesitant to adopt bitcoin — even though some startups need it — for several reasons. One them is that digital currencies are often used to buy and sell illegal drugs and weapons. This, however, is the case with every type of currency in existence. This hasn’t deterred a few cannabis entrepreneurs from giving digital currencies a shot. According to what one said to Forbes, it looks like bitcoin isn’t that popular among its customers, although it did give him a lot of press coverage. As we’ve said before, bitcoin may be the answer to the industry’s banking problem, although there isn’t a consensus. Reportedly, cannabis entrepreneurs don’t seem to see digital currencies as the light at the end of the tunnel. so far, however, this hasn’t meant they won’t take bitcoin in exchange for their pot. Do you think bitcoin is the solution the legal pot business needs? Should potheads and bitheads unite? Let us know in the comments. Images courtesy of Pixabay Have you seen our new widget service?

Also read: India Becomes No.2 Bitcoin Amazon Buyer Amid Rupee Shake-Up Bitcoin.com reported Thursday on India’s government withdrawing the country’s two highest-value banknotes, supposedly in a bid to curb corruption.  The notes are already worthless, but Indians appear to be losing rather than gaining faith in the rupee.  Citing Google Trends searches for ‘buy Bitcoin,’ cofounder of Indian startup Unocoin Sunny Ray unearthed a startling reaction to last Monday’s decision.  Unocoin several months ago partnered with Purse.io to offer Amazon discounts to Indian customers. Thereafter, India rose quickly to become Purse’s second biggest market behind the US. The company tweeting it was “happy” to see the country fill the number two spot. Such a frenzy of activity could well point to a longer-term trend. Many see large scale interest in Bitcoin from a widely cash-based society as the first step in adoption and trade increases. “People who never talked about bitcoins called me. Financial companies also want to invest in bitcoins … that’s a big change in a country where bitcoins have not taken off,” Saurabh Agrawal, CEO of India’s largest exchange ZebPay told local publication Hindustan Times Friday. In practical terms, India as a major bitcoin market makes perfect sense. It has a huge user base with a strong remittance market and burgeoning middle class. However, there there are no strict currency controls like China.  “India represents a massive growth opportunity for Bitcoin and Unocoin is on the cutting edge of Bitcoin and blockchain technology,” said Adam Back of Blockstream, which is also working with Unocoin. A feeling of anticipation exists across the board this week. Speaking to Hindustan Times, Unocoin’s second co-founder Sathvik Vishwanath stated remittance habits were already changing, despite slow growth in liquidity. “People are getting remittances in bitcoins, instead of Paypal. They are able to liquidate them by paying just 1% transaction fee,” he said. “People are just buying [bitcoin] and holding on to it.”  Agrawal meanwhile sees the tipping point in opinions between young and old. “Only when something like this happens (currency notes removed), the millennials think digital asset is the future,” he concluded. India currently has around 400 thousand bitcoin users, of which roughly half transact using ZebPay.

2016-11-12T12:00:48-04:00,South Korean Bank Creates Cross-Border Bitcoin Service,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/south-korean-bank-cross-border-bitcoin/,"One of the oldest banks in South Korea, Shinhan Bank, has revealed it will launch a cryptocurrency remittance service using Bitcoin. A joint effort between the bank and Streami Inc. will oversee the cross-border service between Korea and China. According to Pulse, Shinhan Bank will be the first major financial institution in the region to utilize the Bitcoin blockchain. Streami Inc. is a blockchain remittance middleware and infra provider that aims to ensure secure and cheaper cross-border remittance. Additionally, Shinhan Bank helped lead Streami’s investment round last year and the two organizations formed a partnership. Blockchain remittance could save significant costs and ensure complete transparency for the customer. Moreover, the network is more secure than traditional incumbent remittance services. Streami explained that blockchain is an open data network that can efficiently deliver value across borders. The digital ledger remittance startup also has support from Shinhan bank’s IT  subsidiary Shinhan Data Systems. The two organizations hope to launch the blockchain service this December. However, Bitcoin is not considered legal tender within Korean borders. Shinhan Bank and Streami expect the authorities to legalize and regulate cryptocurrencies in 2017. Until then, the service will use Hong Kong as an intermediary for its blockchain-based currency conversion. Shinhan Bank will leverage its already established clientele and capital stock of KRW 25.0 billion to assist the project. The bank already committed ₩500m (roughly $427,000) to the Streami project last year.  Streami and Shinhan Bank believe South Korea is a fertile landscape for blockchain-based remittance. Korea has over 800,000 foreign workers. With just foreign workers alone, Korean remittance services processed 840,000 transactions (4.4 billion USD) per annum.  South Korea has been a growing hub for financial technology startups and legacy institutions. Shinhan Bank hopes its remittance platform can produce favorable results. However, there are a number of other Bitcoin-related cross-border startups competing in the region. The Korean-based Korbit has offered low-cost remittances with cryptocurrency for quite some time. Korbit’s Hyphen project allows payouts between 24 countries and charges a 1% fee per blockchain transfer. The company also has backing from Softbank Ventures Korea, Pantera Capital, and the Digital Currency Group, raising $3.5 USD million in equity. Shinhan Bank and Streami’s remittance service will be the first platform backed by a legacy financial institution with deep roots in Korea. The application plans to be fully compliant with anti-money laundering (AML) controls. Additionally, it will implement fraud detection, sanction screening, and regulatory reporting. After solidifying the company’s foundations, the Seoul-based startup Steami will expand across Asia targeting Thailand, Singapore, and the Philippines.

2016-11-12T06:00:32-04:00,Trump’s Trade War With China Could Boost Chinese Bitcoin Demand,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/trump-trade-china-chinese-bitcoin-demand/,"U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has pledged to declare China a currency manipulator on day one of his presidency. During his campaign, he also repeatedly pledged to impose a 45% tariff on Chinese goods. His promises risk creating a trade war between the U.S. and China which could weaken the yuan and accelerate Chinese capital outflows. When the yuan falls, investors often turn to bitcoin. Also read: Reports of China Banning Bitcoin Are Greatly Exaggerated  According to former U.S. Trade Representative attorney, Michael Gadbaw, under the Foreign Trade Act of 1974, Trump could use his authority to impose tariffs on China. Many people, however, doubt that Trump will actually impose a 45% tariff on the United States’ biggest trade partner. Alibaba founder and CEO Jack Ma is confident that Trump will not make good on his threats against China. He told CNNMoney that Trump will have to work with China or risk a “disaster”. A Nomura investor survey revealed that 75 percent of respondents expect Trump to impose tariffs on exports from China, South Korea and Japan. Meanwhile, 77 percent of those polled expect him to brand China a currency manipulator. If Trump does impose trade barriers on China, Beijing can either accept weaker exports or respond in kind, said economists at Goldman Sachs. They wrote: However, a weaker yuan could trigger an acceleration in capital outflows, as it has done in the past. The yuan fell to a six-year low on Wednesday. An economist at DBS Group Holdings Ltd. in Hong Kong, Nathan Chow, said “The yuan may be pressured by Trump’s win,” citing Trump’s trade barrier threats against China. According to Goldman Sachs, as much as $78 billion may have left China in September. October outflows are also expected to be large. Analysts and investors say that one reason for an acceleration of capital outflows is because the yuan is weakening faster again against the dollar. This reignites “concern among Chinese individuals and businesses anxious to preserve the value of their domestic savings and assets,” the WSJ reported. In the past, whenever there was a flood of capital outflows from China, a certain amount went into bitcoin. Other safe-haven asset classes also benefited, such as gold and foreign property. The WSJ wrote: Delta Asia Securities’ chief operating officer, Victor Au, told South China Morning Post that when the yuan depreciates, Chinese investors seek to diversify their assets. His company is a subsidiary of Delta Asia Group (Holdings) Limited and provides investment banking services, including securities brokerage, underwriting, and trading services. The currency’s weakness and expectation that it will fall further have significantly increased demand for asset diversification, Au explained, adding that bitcoin is one of the assets that have seen increasing demand. “Limited investment channels for Chinese investors drive them to seek all possible investment tools to preserve their asset value,” he said.

It comes with Cell 411’s decentralized ridesharing app, just launched in Austin, Texas. Also read: ‘Decentralized Uber’ App Delivers 1,000 Meals in Austin, Texas Cell 411 is a disruptor social network originally aimed at letting users provide each other with assistance in emergencies. The startup then branched out into ridesharing at the end of October. “We are excited to add another feature to our platform that is making our users’ lives better,” founder Virgil Vaduva said in a press release.  “Since drivers and riders are not our contractors or employees and we are not involved in the payment process, we are able to give the users the freedom they do not have with Uber and Lyft.” The rapid rise of Uber and its ilk has created a desire in global markets to produce a less centralized equivalent.  Cell 411’s offering takes the idea further than ever: rides can be paid in bitcoin, monero or even silver. Users also have the option of paying in kind via a bartering system. “We don’t control who signs up to use our platform, how they use it and when,” Vaduva explained. Austin is something of a hub for upcoming transport solutions, and already has its fair share of competitors. Previously, however, only Arcade City operated along decentralized principles with cryptocurrency payments. Due in part to its rapid growth, the regulatory hurdles surrounding this market are intensive, requiring operators to even fingerprint every driver they ‘hire’ in any form. Vaduva stated that Cell 411 had “no plans to and we lack the ability to comply with Austin’s burdensome regulations.” “We are not going to fingerprint every single person downloading our app,” he added. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the latest newcomer is causing a stir among the establishment. “[A]t the end of the day, Cell 411 does not have the proper legal authority to operate as a ridesharing service in Austin, according to the Austin Transportation Department,” an article in the local Austin Business Journal stated Wednesday. Cell 411 subsequently appeared to criticize the viewpoint.  Barriers to widespread use could remain, however. The lack of security could put off many potential users. Additionally, an unforeseen mishap could instantly ruin Cell 411’s plans. Nonetheless, the startup reports that a New Hampshire Sheriff has already given his vote to a wider rollout.  “Our platform has been used for over a year by users all over the world to respond to emergency situations and make communities safer,” Vaduva added.

Also read: India’s Law Enforcement Probes Dark Net Markets In a televised speech, Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared this week that larger-denomination rupee bills, specifically 500 ($7.50) and 1000 ($15) rupees, would no longer be legal tender as of November 8. “This step will strengthen the hands of the common man in the fight against corruption, black money and fake currency,” he said. India has long suffered from the effects of corruption, particularly at government level. Modi has attributed the economy’s ill health specifically to this so-called “black money.” “The five hundred and thousand rupee notes hoarded by anti-national and anti-social elements will become just worthless pieces of paper. The rights and the interests of honest, hard-working people will be fully protected,” he continued. The decision came as a surprise to many, with the notes losing their official value just hours after Modi made the announcement. Holders of the notes have until December 30 to cash them in at banks or post offices “without limit.” Modi also recapped on additional moves to monitor banking transactions and international partnerships aimed at cracking down on corrupt money transfers. As a largely cash-based society, however, it is unclear how the sudden reshaping will affect India’s swathes of unbanked people.  “Secrecy was essential for this action,” Modi explained. The nature of Indian commerce at non-official level, dealing in cash and mobile-based micropayments, has made it fertile ground for Bitcoin startups. Kenya is often referred to as the African success story due to its leapfrogging traditional banking penetration. Likewise, India is already showing huge potential for bitcoin to empower citizens. Bitcoin.com previously reported on local exchange Coinsecure’s pioneering real-time app, which seeks to cater to bitcoin holders of all levels, as well as efforts by Unocoin to offer Amazon purchases to unbanked shoppers. Now, Unocoin partner Purse.io reports that India holds second place in the number of users making bitcoin purchases through its Amazon discount service. “We’re happy to see India at #2,” the company tweeted Tuesday.  Meanwhile, in line with many markets around the world, India witnessed increased bitcoin trading ahead of the US election.  “There is uncertainty over who will win the election and what impact they will have. It is definitely going to increase the value of bitcoin, with chances that the figure may cross $850,” one Mumbai portfolio manager told local news resource The Economic Times in the lead-up to the vote.

Also read: Bitcoin.com Podcast: Bitcoin Investment Funds with Ransu Salovaara Does your computer sit idle while you’re asleep? Do you have spare GPU cycles or disk space even when you’re awake? Distributed resource networks have existed on the internet since at least the 1990s. But until bitcoin came along, participation was voluntary-only. There simply wasn’t any good way to pay users every time their computing power got used. Times are obviously different now. Describing his platform as “the AirBnB of computing”, Zone says we now have the ability to unlock and draw value from unused spaces. Pooling these resources, on a global scale, presents a “trillion dollar opportunity”. Even if you don’t have spare resources, users are even adding peripherals like external drives to their systems to rent via Suchflex. The platform has a very nice and noob-friendly GUI dashboard for monitoring activity and providing information on what hardware earns what. Since mining bitcoins using consumer resources isn’t an option these days, Suchflex uses the network to mine other cryptocurrencies like ether. It also provides optional payouts in its own native currency Flexcoin. Suchflex takes on contract clients who pay to use its network’s resources. Zone says these are mainly in the machine learning field. These clients help fund the operation and pay users. The service also offers a range of philanthropic distributed computing options for users to donate resources to. One is the long-running SETI@Home program to look for extraterrestrial intelligence. Other options include Weather@Home, MindModeling@Home, RenderFarming.net and the World Community Grid. Zone also describes how Suchflex works and answers questions about the amount of control users have over when and how the system uses their resources. Gavin asks the most important question of all — how do users actually make money, especially if contributing cycles to altruistic projects like SETI?

The company is providing the API to help curate the cryptocurrency market within India. Also read: Le Cercle du Coin Creates a ‘Bitcoin Boulevard’ in Paris    Unocoin has been expanding its operations following a $1.5 million funding round — an Indian national record. The company said it released its API so companies can take advantage of its services set. Unocoin’s API provides the ability for individuals to create bitcoin wallets, buy and sell, retrieve real-time or historical price information, and more. The company says it is experiencing “unprecedented growth”, hiring more than thirty employees and servicing over 100,000 customers. It has rigorously tested the API among its Indian clientele. Furthermore, the API has been an integral asset to businesses such as Paycase, a Canadian remittance service. Unocoin co-founder and CEO, Sathvik Vishwanath stated during the announcement: “We’ve been excited to develop a robust API for use by companies around the world. Our API is best described as an on-ramp for firms looking for a simple way to gain entry into one of the world’s fastest growing and largest potential markets,” Vishwanath added. “Our team has been working non-stop prior to and during our Pre-Series A round to provide the most reliable, full-featured API, but one that, most importantly, is incredibly easy to adopt.” Unocoin said the custom API can plug into any company’s software worldwide. This allows users to tap directly into the Indian Bitcoin market and remittance industry, which is estimated to be worth $100 billion USD. India is considered the world capital of remittance, with a significantly large gold and IT economy. In order to assist Unocoin’s fast and low-cost cross-border transactions, the firm is working with Blockstream’s Liquid network. Paycase is currently utilizing the network and Unocoin API to enable quicker transactions from Canada to India.  Paycase says users have experimented with its “protocol-agnostic transfer routing system” across twenty countries worldwide. It says that the protocol is significantly more efficient than the traditional SWIFT network. According to Paycase, over the course of six months in beta, the platform completed $50,000 worth of micro-transactions from Canada to the Philippines. The average cost was 60-80% lower than incumbent remittance businesses. “Our work with Unocoin shows both company’s long-term dedication to one another, in strategically partnering to take bitcoin and Blockchain powered remittances and cross-border transfer to the mass market,” said Paycase Co-founder and CEO Joseph Weinberg. “We have worked together from Canada and India to establish the technical, regulatory, and business logic needed to enable Canadian dollar to Indian rupee money transfer with bitcoin efficiencies in place. With the API, experience, and infrastructure in place, we can now scale this model beyond our current corridors and into the promising Indian market.” Since Unocoin’s Pre-Series A round led by Blume Ventures, the Digital Currency Group, Boost VC, BankToTheFuture and many others, the startup aims to progress further. The firm recently released its iOS application and an Android version is on the way. Additionally, the company launched a merchant point-of-sale (POS) platform and has also made solid partnerships with NETKI, Blockstream, and Purse.io. Bitcoin growth in India has been quite vast, according to the Hindustantimes. Other operations such as Zebpay and Coinsecure are also making headway in the region.

Also read: Trump Vs Clinton: Bitcoin Illiteracy in 2016 Presidential Election In what is being regarded as one of the most unlikely political victories, Trump’s win is piling pressure on the dollar and has sent financial markets tumbling – aiding Bitcoin in the process. Reactions are already coming in the form of USD shunning, with Quartz quoting professional poker player Shannon Shorr:  While the Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta buoyantly reminded his camp that “they are still counting votes,” Trump has already secured more than the 270 electoral college seats needed to win.  The election result not only means short-term financial upset. The widely-held belief the Federal Reserve would hike interest rates in December has now come into question. “It raises the odds that the Fed will not move in December,” chief Moody’s analyst Mark Zandi told Reuters. Chicago Federal Reserve president Charles Evans responded that there was a need for “independence from short term political pressure.” Trump however in his acceptance speech struck a rather different tone. “We have a great economic plan, we will double our growth and have the strongest economy anywhere in the world,” he said. Elsewhere, analysts responded warily to the reality that Trump’s almost unbelievable election pledges could come true in some form. “His tax cuts could open up a huge increase in the budget deficit and his trade sanctions could interrupt world trade. This could put us in a recession,” Retuers quotes Donald Selkin, chief market strategist at National Securities, New York. Other US news meanwhile focuses on an entirely different political matter which is buoying bitcoin. While the country focuses on Trump, not just California but also Maine, Massachusetts, Florida and North Dakota among others moved to legalize cannabis, either for medical or recreational use.  California’s vote was widely forecast to be successful, and the move brings legitimacy to a multi-billion dollar industry which previously could not operate in the open. Last month, Bitcoin.com reported on the first initative to bring POS tools fully in-line with regulation to California and Oregon dispensaries, with further states to follow. Bitcoin would be the transaction medium of choice.  “If we’re successful, it’s the beginning of the end of the war on marijuana,” lieutenant governor of California Gavin Newsom commented to the New York Times last week prior to the vote.

Also read:Rootstock Launches New Testnet ‘Turmeric’ This December the fourth Brazilian Bitcoin conference will be educating people from the region the benefits of emerging blockchain technologies. The conference will have a wide range of speakers coming from legacy businesses, early startups, and academia. Discussions will revolve around the budding blockchain industry, Bitcoin’s many advantages, and Ethereum. Speakers will include Bitpagos  founder and CEO Sebastian Serrano, ChameleonBit CEO Diego Vellasco, Patrícia Estevão on Bitcoin usability and security, and Everton Fraga from the Ethereum project. The conference in Belo Horizonte was organized by André Horta CEO of Bitcoin To You, administrator of the Bitcoin Brazil group Wladimir Crippa, and P2P vendor Marcelo Brant.  The first Brazilian Bitcoin conference “I BitConf” took place in Florianópolis. The event was very successful at bringing people together from many Brazilian states and Argentina. BitConf was an initiative started by the Brazilian Facebook community and other Bitcoin-related group pages.  The conference had many discussions concerning the importance of Bitcoin and economics. One speaker, Fernando Ulrich, a Mises Brazil Institute advisor and InfoMoney columnist, discussed the many benefits of Bitcoin within the Latin American economy. Throughout the event, many debate sessions discussed the decentralized money and blockchain landscape. Another discussion involved the Vice-President of the Bitcoin Foundation of Argentina, Rodolfo Andragnes and Bernardo Quintão, founder of Grow Investimentos, who participated in a roundtable conversation. Since the first conference, organizers have held two more events with each growing bigger. The conferences have been focused on the surrounding cryptocurrency landscape in mainly Argentina and Brazil. However they also covered expansion in other countries, such as the US, China and Russia.  Bitcoin’s benefits are becoming well-known in Brazil, Argentina, Venezuela, and across the Latin American region. Many countries in Latin America are suffering from a deep recession and steadily-increasing inflation. In particular, Venezuela’s inflation rate reached 720% over the course of the year with similar conditions taking place in neighboring countries. Quite a few citizens from these regions now want to take part in the decentralized Bitcoin economy.  Many believe Latin American countries like Brazil and Argentina are fertile ground for bitcoin adoption. Currently, both these countries have seen an exponential rise in bitcoin usage, according to local bitcoins volumes. By the end of 2015, Bitpay had seen significant growth across Latin America with transactions up over 1747%. “Latin America is proving to be an incredibly favorable environment for Bitcoin. A high proportion of the population has little or no access to traditional financial services,” said Bitpay. The fourth annual Bitcoin conference in Belo Horizonte Brazil aims to continue to curate this popularity. Tickets to the event are available here along with accommodations around the area.

Also read: China’s New Blockchain Drive: Who’s Leading it, and Why? While Chinese government reactions to Bitcoin helped knock several percentage points off Bitcoin’s value last week, overall traction is not slowing.  Bitcoin is today trading at around $709, heading off the slump attributed to worries of a Chinese crackdown which saw a dip below the $700 barrier. China’s troubled currency meanwhile continues to lose value, due to what Bloomberg describes as the government’s “struggles to plug loopholes in capital controls.” “[T]here is wide expectation for the yuan to weaken against the dollar beyond the U.S. presidential election result,” Malayan Banking strategist Fiona Lim told the publication. “So all in all, risks to the yuan really are to the downside.” Bitcoin is just one tool Chinese investors are using to exploit these loopholes. For forex traders cashing out yuan into currencies like USD, however, the safe haven may be short-lived. Beyond the boost or drop in USD depending on Wednesday’s election outcome, economic factors are poised to create further turbulence going into December. Pundits are widely expecting a Federal Reserve rate hike following rising inflation, which it says “is no longer expected to remain weak.” Across the pond in Europe, meanwhile, another tension of a different kind is brewing. Italy’s referendum, scheduled for December 4, proposes wide-ranging political reforms aimed at increasing stability. Center-left prime minister Matteo Renzi at one point said he would resign if he lost and the country voted “no,” but has since done a U-turn now the “no” camp is ahead in the polls.  The broad implications of a “no” vote in Italy remain uncertain. However, an alternative government may be comprised of considerably more Euro-sceptic parties such as the rival Five Star Movement. Tension over European Union membership could unsettle markets all over again – especially in the wake of Brexit and the instability the UK pound sterling continues to battle with. Moreover, while bitcoin is rarely the darling of traditional finance analysts, current turbulence has led to some surprising conclusions from the fiat depths. “For now, it seems like many have nominated bitcoin as their exit plan if the October surprise dealt by FBI Director James Comey turns into a November market shock,” Bloomberg’s Christopher Langner conceded in a market recap today.

2016-11-08T12:00:13-04:00,The FCA Is Testing Bitcoin Cross-Border Transactions,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/fca-bitcoin-cross-border-transactions/,"The UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is currently testing clearing and settlement solutions using Bitcoin. The financial services regulatory commission has been working with digital currency operation Epiphyte, a firm that settles cross-border payments using blockchain technology. Also read: Le Cercle du Coin Creates a ‘Bitcoin Boulevard’ in Paris According to a few UK news sources, the FCA is determined to harness cross-border blockchain settlement. The FCA created its sandbox accelerator last spring, and received applications from roughly 69 firms. The sandbox provides an environment for early startups and legacy incumbents to build fintech solutions. Now the London-based remittance startup Epiphyte will work with the FCA to provide cost efficient and secure transactions, using a peer-to-peer protocol like Bitcoin.      During the sandbox testing phase, Epiphyte plans to provide an alternative solution to traditional SWIFT settlement methods, the FCA said. Epiphyte said it will deploy a platform called SpecialFX over the next few weeks. The solution will tether fiat currency with Bitcoin as the underlying mechanism for settlement. “In practice, it will be FCA regulated. But it’s regulated as part of the sandbox; so it will be authorized,” said Edan Yago, CEO of Epiphyte. “It’s the same technological platform that allows you to transfer funds over Bitcoin and Ethereum and really any blockchain system. So we can integrate with any blockchain system.”  Yago said the FCA had designated a case officer who helps coach the project. Epiphyte has worked with other legacy institutions in the past including BBVA, and more recently Visa. “The work that we did with Visa we have also done with a number of other banks— the only one that is public right now is BBVA,” he explained. The blockchain startup says its platform utilizes the security of blockchain technology with real-time settlement. Yago added that the FCA’s sandbox provides the company with the ability to work with different clients looking to transfer funds. Epiphyte will first offer the platform to remittance companies and FX firms, finally leading to retail and enterprise solutions. Yago also said the protocol will divert from using SWIFT or SEPA methods. The process will be completed on the blockchain and over a system that is as fast as CHAPS. By relying on systems like SWIFT, businesses often have to wait multiple days for settlement and aggregate unnecessary fees. Because the length of time is so long for standard clearing and settlement practices, Yago believes it’s less transparent and more difficult for regulators. “There this huge amount of uncertainty. And there is no transparency, so while the transaction is being performed, you don’t know where your funds are.—From regulatory perspective, it’s much harder for regulators and law enforcement to track activity through these systems because it’s not real-time,” Yago explains to the press. “They don’t have real-time visibility, they only have retroactive visibility, and even then, they usually have to go and try and obtain information for multiple parties or intermediaries who are involved in this transaction to get a full picture.” The FCA believes blockchain has some significant potential, according to Chris Woolard, the FCA’s director of strategy. Woolard explained in August the FCA was working with firms that are creating applications to benefit customers and make regulatory compliance easier. Another cross-border money transfer service powered by cryptocurrency, BitX, will also work with the FCA. Epiphyte’s plans to bolster the FCA’s R&D efforts with Bitcoin will use an off-chain technique. As a result, a payment channel much like the Lightning network will be deployed ensuring scaling and speed. “The transactions all can be written to blockchain; it’s a little bit like the Lightning Network. So end up with the same degree of security that you would get from blockchain transactions with a higher degree of scalability and privacy,” Yago detailed.  It will be interesting to see what kind of solutions transpire from the FCA’s sandbox as it seems they are steadfast on the use of blockchain technology.

With help from Maison du Bitcoin, the boulevard passage will feature an eclectic range of merchants, artisans, and bistros that are proponents of the decentralized cryptocurrency. Also read: Reports of China Banning Bitcoin Are Greatly Exaggerated Jacques Favier, co-founder and Secretary of Le Cercle du Coin wanted Bitcoin to have its own boulevard in Paris. So the French-speaking European Bitcoin association decided to act on the idea. The group has designated the Passage du Grand Cerf, a beautiful location located in the heart of the trendy quarter of Montorgueil, as its Bitcoin Boulevard. The Passage du Grand Cerf will have 25 retailers who accept bitcoin, and a creative workshop in the region. Le Cercle du Coin says the passage will have stylish artwork, decorative pieces, and fashionable accessories available for bitcoin.  Additionally, visitors can check out the famous Maison du Bitcoin (‘The House of Bitcoin’). The well-known establishment opened in 2014, offering a creative co-working space for entrepreneurs, an educational environment, and a Bitcoin ATM.  “We really wanted Paris to have its own Bitcoin Boulevard as they are called in other cities,” explains Jacques Favier, Secretary of Le Cercle du Coin. “It is important for Bitcoin’s image, as Bitcoin is something smart and subtle to understand but really easy to use.” The boulevard concept was initiated by Le Cercle du Coin, Maison du Bitcoin, and the Atlanta-based Bitpay. The three firms want to create a focal point in Paris and coach along the idea of Passage du Grand Cerf as the Bitcoin passageway. Some of the merchants taking part in the Bitcoin Boulevard include Le Pas Sage, L’Illustre boutique, Marie & Benoit, De marseille et d’ailleurs, and many more brick and mortar shops.  The Le Cercle du Coin association has been bolstering Bitcoin and blockchain technology since its inception. There are seven founders involved from three different countries, with over 50 members from France. Members consist of young startups, students, lawmakers, journalists and more, committed to supporting “projects about the new distributed money, with no banks and no borders.” The Paris boulevard is an idea that hopes to spread more bitcoin adoption and to educate the masses on decentralized cryptocurrency. Paris has had a healthy relationship with Bitcoin for quite some time. “I have known about the Passage du Grand Cerf for a long time, and I felt that Bitcoin could give its merchants a common project. People tripping around the world, using bitcoin only, will find an opportunity here to get their souvenir de Paris, and Parisians seeing our stickers on those elegant stores’ windows will know bitcoin is also a distinctive element to show modernity and talent,” Favier said.  Additionally, many other cities worldwide such as Switzerland’s Zug and the Dutch city of Arnhem have also created Bitcoin hubs. Passage du Grand Cerf will be another area that is very friendly towards the use of bitcoin, and will help spread awareness about its benefits.

2016-11-07T06:00:24-04:00,Colorado Cannabis Operations Begin Banking With Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/colorado-cannabis-banking-bitcoin/,"Across the United States, cannabis operations are now becoming common. However, cannabis business owners from fully-legalized states such as Washington and Colorado are having a hard time cashing in on their frowned-upon weed businesses. According to Motherboard, one Colorado hemp farmer is turning to bitcoin and teaching others how to leverage the decentralized currency. Also read: Cannabis Security Firm Goes Bitcoin to Solve Industry’s Banking Problem Cannabis is legal in a couple of states now, but it’s not the “easy money” everyone thinks. In fact, in Colorado, many businesses have had a hard time dealing with large sums of cash, credit card services and PayPal. For more than a year now, merchants have been looking for a way to deposit significant amounts of money. However, the banking industry under the U.S. Federal Reserve wants nothing to do with cannabis money, because marijuana is still illegal at the federal level.  Groups of people in Colorado have even tried to form their own marijuana credit union, but bureaucrats squashed the effort. Furthermore, indirectly-related merchants are seeing their accounts frozen or shut down for dealing with cannabis-related sales. PayPal and credit card companies are infamous for censoring products and services they don’t approve of. According to a recent Motherboard report, cannabis business owners are either opting out from using banks or lying about their operations. The article detailed that many business operators keep activities secret, but eventually these merchants are getting caught. One such person is Tim Cullen, owner of the Colorado Harvest Grow Op. When Wells Fargo figured out Cullen’s funds paid for cannabis operations, the banks shut his account down. The bank also closed the accounts of family members related to Cullen. Another cultivator who also had monetary issues is 38-year old Veronica Carpio, who works in the hemp farming business. Carpio, the first female dispensary owner in Colorado, has turned to bitcoin to escape the ongoing censorship. After using PayPal for her business operations, the payments processor closed her account and froze her money for six months. Carpio told Motherboard her situation during the CryptoCannabis Conference in Denver stating:  After realizing that PayPal could stunt her business operations, Carpio said she began to study blockchain technology and Bitcoin. Following this, she integrated Bitcoin into her operations using Mycelium for processing transactions. Carpio said it was easy to use Mycelium’s software and integrate Bitcoin into her shop’s infrastructure, but getting people to use the digital currency was a little harder. After discovering Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant features, Carpio said it was still difficult for old school hemp farmers to understand. Some people had the notion that bitcoin was “illegal, imaginary and really doesn’t work,” Carpio told Motherboard. So Caprio took things further by co-founding an educational resource 1620 Solutions. The consulting operation details the many benefits of cryptocurrency such as no bank accounts required, no third parties, lower processing fees, and more. The platform has come up with a step-by-step solution for cannabis operations to integrate bitcoin.  Carpio’s co-founder Edgar Hamm, a biodynamic hemp farmer, believes 1620 Solutions is an excellent alternative to the cannabis banking problem. “If we’re going to move toward a future that is actually sustainable then we need to move towards things like bitcoin. It moves everything back to local,” Hamm explained. With bitcoin, the future is bright because it offers a system that doesn’t judge businesses by their operations. The network runs 24/7 without a government, corporation, or boardroom controlling its transactions. Bitcoin is the peer-to-peer solution for the cannabis banking problem that takes the money out of the hands of central banks and bureaucrats. Thanks to individuals like Veronica Carpio, Edgar Hamm, and educational sources like 1620 Solutions, cannabis farmers can evolve their business operations and maintain their livelihood.

2016-11-04T15:49:18-04:00,Reports of China Banning Bitcoin Are Greatly Exaggerated,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/reports-china-bitcoin-exaggerated/,"On November 3 the Bitcoin price took a dive from a high of US$745 to a low of $675 with news of China circling the internet. A so-called report from the publication Bloomberg had other media outlets assume that China was planning on curbing Bitcoin use in the near future. However, the reports have remained unconfirmed, and many believe the headline was fictitious. Also read: China to Play a ‘Leading Role’ in Bitcoin’s Future The stories that surround China and Bitcoin are quite vast. From “secret” mining operations, to “free” electricity, to a large portion of Bitcoin transactions being traded for yuan the list goes on forever. The fact is news from China plays a significant role in a lot of people’s speculation. The November 3rd fiasco is no different as the news spread through the market and the community went wild.  Early in the morning the publication ZeroHedge published the article “China Prepares To Impose Curbs, “Capital Controls” On Bitcoin.” The news outlet is well known for writing stories regarding the global economy and subjects like gold and Bitcoin. At times the publication writes editorials predicting the cryptocurrency’s value will pump. Many of these articles are very popular throughout the Bitcoin community.  The November 3rd article was also quite popular, and some believe it made a difference in the market. The anonymous reporter Tyler Durden states within the article, “According to Bloomberg sources, Chinese officials are considering policies including restricting domestic bitcoin exchanges from moving the cryptocurrency to platforms outside the nation and imposing quotas on the amount of bitcoins that can be sent abroad.” However, the Bloomberg report cannot be confirmed as legitimate, and the article in question does not appear on their website. What’s interesting is that many people within the Bitcoin industry have claimed the reports are false. For instance, the CEO of Vaultoro explains that the recent Chinese headline may be false. The Vaultoro founder says while speaking with a friend who works for the Chinese Bitcoin company BitBank he was told the reports are misleading.  The BitBank representative says that if anyone wants to know how Chinese authorities feel about Bitcoin to read this editorial. The article written by Bitcoin.com’s Jon Southurst detailed a blockchain conference hosted by the Chinese government. Within the editorial, it explains that Chinese officials had no problem discussing Bitcoin. In fact, Ji Xiaonan, of China’s State-Owned Asset Supervision and Administration Commission said some positive words towards Bitcoin stating it was “the only mature blockchain technology today.” Another interesting aspect of the story is the controversial Bloomberg article has similarities to another published piece this past May. The headline for November 3rds article read “China Said to Mull Curbing Outflows Via Bitcoin on Yuan Drop.” This title and the paragraphs that follow it are very much the same as this article published in May by the Bloomberg news outlet. The story called “China to Mull Curbs on Domestic Backdoor Listing Valuations” has almost identical wording as the alleged Bitcoin article with certain words replaced throughout. Furthermore historically when the price of Bitcoin rises stories of China and other countries banning Bitcoin have appeared in great number. When Bitcoin was on a tear in 2013 reaching close to $1150 per BTC, these stories came out often. Publications like Bloomberg reported on China cracking down on Bitcoin as well as Forbes, the New York Times, and many others. Typically when these reports published, the price took a dive, but government officials banning Bitcoin never materialized. The price of Bitcoin has managed to regain its upward push slightly below the $700 range. Reports of China curbing Bitcoin outflows seems to be just another rumor that shook up the market. Many wonder if these headlines will affect the value of BTC again in the future. Moreover, the question is how much does China’s stake in Bitcoin really matter when it comes to this industry?

2016-11-04T06:00:30-04:00,Italy’s Largest Taxi Fleet Accepts Bitcoin,Kevin Helms,https://news.bitcoin.com/italys-largest-taxi-fleet-bitcoin/,"Italy’s largest taxi fleet, Cooperativa RadioTaxi 3570, now accepts bitcoin. The company boasts over 3,700 cars in Rome, providing more than 10 million cab services each year. Also read: France’s Third Largest Bus Company Accepts Bitcoin  Created in November 1968 by a little more than 100 founding members, RadioTaxi 3570 is “the Roman radio cab cooperative belonging to Roman taxi drivers who want to be part of it,” states its website. The company claims to have the lowest price in all of Europe. Its switchboard receives roughly 30,000 calls daily, 7,000 of which are from foreign tourists. RadioTaxi 3570 is ISO 9001 certified and is the first taxi organization in Italy to obtain quality certification. It also received the ICT Innovation Prize 2010 and ICT Innovation Prize 2012. The company claims: Bitcoin is listed under ‘Payment methods’ alongside credit card, Bancomat, and PayPal as one of the “commitments that Cooperativa RadioTaxi 3570 takes towards its clients,” according to its website. Payment in bitcoin is made possible, thanks to Chainside, a startup enabling businesses to accept bitcoin. In September, Chainside formed  a partnership with the Italian Union of Radio Cabs (URI) and its founder, Loreno Bittarelli, to offer wallet, invoice, and monitoring services. Bittarelli is also president of RadioTaxi 3570. The Chainside platform is integrated into URI’s booking app for smartphones and tablets, IT Taxi. RadioTaxi 3570 is also using this app. Users booking a trip connect to IT Taxi for price and route calculations. Customers paying in bitcoin are redirected to a page on Chainside. Once payment is received, confirmation is sent back to IT Taxi. The partnership with Chainside is not the first time that URI and RadioTaxi 3570 have explored a bitcoin payment option. In June 2015, they co-hosted a hackathon for the industry at RadioTaxi 3570’s media room in Rome. TaxiHack was the first hackathon for innovations dedicated to taxi service. The 48-hour event was organized by URI in partnership with Codemotion. The winner of the hackathon was BitTaxi, an app that allows customers to pay for rides in bitcoin. “Our team has been working to create an integrated module in itTaxi,” the company’s website states. Bittarelli commented after the hackathon: Once BitTaxi’s bitcoin payment module for IT Taxi is complete, URI and RadioTaxi 3570 will have more than one way to accept bitcoin. The app is used by both RadioTaxi 3570 and URI taxis. While the former has 3,700 cars, the latter has 12,000 members operating in approximately 50 cities throughout Italy.

2016-11-03T06:00:50-04:00,Hillary Clinton Does Not Stand for Women if She Doesn’t Stand for Bitcoin,Elizabeth McCauley,https://news.bitcoin.com/hillary-clinton-women-bitcoin/,"Just this past week, Wikileaks revealed Hillary Clinton’s decision to avoid accepting donations in Bitcoin for her presidential campaign. This leak came on the heels of the Clinton Campaign’s announcement of an Initiative on Technology & Innovation where she used the phrase “public service blockchain applications,” in her proposal. So why would this self-proclaimed ‘pro-women’ candidate reject a technology that can and already is transforming the lives of women globally?  Also Read: Enemies of the Sharing Economy  Hillary Clinton for President Campaign Chairman, John Podesta, received a request to add the Ven digital currency to the campaign’s donation platform.  In an email to his colleague, Podesta wrote: “I don’t send all the crazy ideas I hear about at fundraisers your way, but this seems interesting and legit. Essentially digital currency with a green angle as opposed to bitcoin’s libertarian Ayn Rand schtick.”  Several interesting things to note. Where is Ven digital currency used that bitcoin is not? What is the market capital of Ven digital currency? Why the complete mockery of Bitcoin and its association with a solid female leader who had a strong grasp on economics?  To add insult to injury, when one reads through the full email chain, it’s clear that Podesta and the campaign were really only looking at a digital currency for political reasons.  They aimed to match the more forward thinking nature of the of the Republican party and presidential candidates like Rand Paul who became the first presidential candidate to accept donations in bitcoin.  Podesta wrote: “As we discussed, Bitcoin is being used on the Republican side and could be a useful tool…”  A recent Coindesk article entitled, “Making Sense of Hillary Clinton’s Bitcoin Rejection,” ground on the nerves of many in the Bitcoin community. Some key questions come to mind: Why rationalize the rejection of a FinTech innovation? Why openly believe that a candidate will support all blockchain applications when rejecting the killer application of the blockchain, Bitcoin? Why tout the interest of a candidate in technological innovation when she picks and chooses what is not too libertarian for her campaign’s liking?  One can attempt to really rationalize almost anything. However, an open refusal to proactively embrace a freedom-promoting currency should be a red flag.  What we do know is that Bitcoin truly can and has already empowered women globally. Bitcoin can enable female entrepreneurs regardless of their socioeconomic status. Women are more likely than men to be financially excluded. Upwards of 50% of women globally are financially excluded.  However, we know that Bitcoin can provide an avenue for these women to join a global economy and have greater financial access. In countries like Saudi Arabia, where women are prohibited from getting a bank account, Bitcoin is a solution. Imagine being a woman in Saudi Arabia and being forced to have a “male guardian” publicly approve of your decision to open a bank account.  With Bitcoin, a woman can get started anywhere around the world with internet connection and minimal capital. With Bitcoin ATMs on the rise, purchasing Bitcoin with cash is an even greater possibility for these marginalized and oppressed women.  So this brings us to the point — why doesn’t Hillary Clinton simply walk the walk and talk the talk and support an innovation that goes beyond including women but actually proactively supports women?  We can speculate the former Secretary of State’s views on Bitcoin from her Campaign Chairman’s email and additionally her public and nonprofit track record. There is the simple adage, “tell me who your friends are and I will tell you who you are.”  If Hillary is surrounding herself with top advisors who mock freedom promoting innovations, what does that show you? If we take it a step further and state something like, “tell me who is financially backing you and I will tell you what your policies are….” it can be eye opening.  We again know full well that Bitcoin provides hope and access to women in countries like Saudi Arabia, but we also know that the Clinton Foundation accepted a donation of 50 million USD from the government of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia is not the only anti-women and anti-LGBTQ country backing the Foundation.  Bitcoin is also a tool for individuals to leverage to hold the powers that be accountable. With voter fraud on the rise and often a lack of a concrete trail of how taxpayer dollars are truly spent, Bitcoin’s underlying platform of the blockchain can provide greater accountability and transparency.  Again, we also know that Hillary Clinton has struggled with following protocol that leaders and citizens alike follow in the areas of security clearances and not breaking the law by lying under oath.  So perhaps, sad but maybe true, she may not want to support a currency and a movement that can shed light on rampant corruption but also empower those who are the most vulnerable in the United States and globally.  We will leave it up to you to decide. What do you think? Why did Hillary Clinton reject accepting donations in Bitcoin? Let us know in the comments below!

The firm is also focused on pricing aimed at “consumer value exchange” with a vast array of currencies. Also read: Storj Partners With Heroku as Marketplace Add-on Founded in 2013 by Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire, Boston-based Circle Financial has continued to move in the Bitcoin industry. The ambitious company has created a reputable platform for buying and selling bitcoin and has also introduced storage for fiat currencies.  To date, the startup has raised US$146 million and just recently received another $60 million. This past week, Circle also introduced its social payment application to Spain and Ireland.  Residents from these countries can now connect both Spanish and Irish bank accounts to receive digital currencies. Circle said people from the region can send and receive payments, get euro support, and get a competitive exchange rate with zero fees. Founders Jeremy Allaire and Sean Neville stated during the announcement:  At the end of June, Circle Financial raised $60 million from Chinese investors and announced its global vision. The firm also reported that since it has worked with the U.S. and U.K. in the past, it will work with other countries’ regulators. With its strategic partners in China, the company is focused on scaling operations in Beijing.  The Chinese operation will be another subsidiary of the business called “Circle China.” At the time of the announcement, the firm explained its effort to promote “benefits of open, global, blockchain-powered social payments to Chinese consumers.”  Circle’s founders explained that traditionally, those sending value and currencies across the world users are charged “enormous fees.” For instance, the company says that with a typical wire transfer banks add 3-4% on top of the market rate. Additionally, these financial institutions also add a one-time fee to the balance. While incumbents charge nearly 10% above market rate, fintech companies have dropped this to 1-2% above the market. Circle said it wants to offer the best possible rate globally by only charging 0.2%-0.3% above current rates. Circle aims to make exchanging digital money as effortless and as fun as social media. The firm also recently integrated with Apple’s iOS 10 iMessage platform, enabling users to exchange bitcoin and fiat currencies over SMS. When a user connects a bank account or debit card to Circle, it wants users to feel the combined familiarity with payments and messaging behaviors.  Circle’s expansion into Spain and Ireland adds more reinforcements to the company’s global conquest. Bitcoin proponents worldwide will now have more avenues to purchase and sell the cryptocurrency, as the company slowly works its way into each country. Though taking its time working with officials and regulations, Circle Financial is on a fast track to achieving its vision. Low fees and inclusion in every country will help with this goal.  “Over the long run, we believe that the ‘spread’ paid by consumers when exchanging value across currencies will not only approach zero, but reach zero, just as the cost of a voice chat, a text message, and an email have reached zero,” said Circle founders Sean Neville and Jeremy Allaire.   What do you think about Circle offering services to Ireland and Spain?

Also read: No Bitcoin Treasure Island yet as Iceland’s Pirate Party Falls Short A Reuters request also revealed the BitLicense program has an application backlog of 15, with a lack of qualified staff blamed for the snail’s rate approval progress. “By putting the regulations together and having key staff members leaving almost thereafter, they really put the industry behind the eight-ball in terms of competing with traditional service providers,” former Bitcoin Foundation executive director Patrick Murck told the publication. The BitLicense project, which became notorious in cryptocurrency circles during its creation and release, was spearheaded by former Superintendent of the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS) Benjamin Lawsky.  Lawsky was vocal about needing comprehensive regulation of cryptocurrency businesses within the state of New York. This perspective drew heavy criticism from businesses and commentators. However, when the preliminary BitLicense regulations became legally binding in June 2015, Lawsky abruptly left, along with several senior staff shortly afterwards. Since then, it appears progress has all but ground to a halt, with critics noting other states will soon outwit New York in supporting progressive or disruptive technology businesses. California, for example, dropped proposals for a similar BitLicense in August. This month, the state even permitted comprehensive merchant payment solutions for medicinal cannabis using cryptocurrency.   New York has become something of a dinosaur even at consumer level, with popular cryptocurrency services such as ShapeShift and Poloniex blocked in the region. Users are currently forced to go to New Jersey instead. Meanwhile, support is again rallying against a proposed update to Bitlicense which would impose further requirements related to cybersecurity.   The addendum would “would require each covered entity to assess its specific risk profile and design a program that addresses its risks,” JD Supra reports, and would cover “any person operating under or required to operate under a license, registration, charter, certificate, permit, accreditation or similar authorization under the banking law, the insurance law or the financial services law.” Another interesting development is this week’s announcement of former NYDFS advisor Dana Syracuse’s appointment to Blockchain advisor for lawyers Perkins Coie. Syracuse played a key development role during Bitlicense’s conception, but left NYDFS soon after. However, not everyone is downbeat about the state of Bitcoin business in New York. Coin Center executive director Jerry Brito told Reuters the economic status quo will ensure the jurisdiction still gets its fair share of innovation.  “I think it’s going to be rare that companies say, ‘We’re not going to do business in New York,’” he said. What do you think is the future for BitLicense in New York? Can regulators remedy the current situation? Let us know in the comments section below.

2016-11-01T02:00:44-04:00,Ronald Mcdonald House to Receive Donations From Bitcoin.com Store,Joseph Young,https://news.bitcoin.com/ronald-mcdonald-donations-bitcoin-store/,"The Bitcoin Store, a bitcoin-only e-commerce platform run by the operators of Bitcoin.com, is donating 10 percent of its apparel sales from November 1st to 24th to the Ronald McDonald House of the Capital Region in Albany, New York as an initiative for Giving Tuesday. Also read: Bitcoin and Blockchain Open New Management Frontiers Ronald McDonald House Charities is a reputable charity fund and organization sponsored by major multi-billion dollar corporations such as McDonald’s UK and Coca-Cola GB.  Furthermore, the organization currently offers three core programs: Ronald McDonald House, Ronald McDonald Family Room and Ronald McDonald Care Mobile. All these programs focus on helping families in need.    Bitcoin Store donations will go to the Ronald McDonald House Capital region branch’s Families First program, in which families receive services and essential products such as diapers and car repairs.  Ronald McDonald House (RMcH) of the Capital Region began accepting bitcoin donations in 2014 as part of a collaboration with the NY Bitcoin Group. “RMcH was one of the first charities we worked with in 2014,” said Paul Paterakis, a member of the NY Bitcoin Group.  “It’s nice to see our work with them lead to partnerships like this. We hope to help many more individuals, businesses, and charities in the Upstate New York area better understand bitcoin and its benefits.” NY Bitcoin Group and other organizations in the past have had the opportunity to work with the RMcH team in using bitcoin to fund various charities and funds. Jeff Yule, Executive Director for RMcH of the Capital Region, stated the foundation has been accepting micro-donations from McDonald’s restaurants in bitcoin. Yule further emphasized bitcoin’s importance in settling micro-donations, as only a limited number of financial networks and payment platforms are currently able to handle small transactions with low fees. “I loved the idea of being able to accept micro-donations over the internet,” said Yule.  “We already accept micro-donations from the canisters found in McDonald’s restaurants, so bitcoin helped us accept them digitally as well. It’s also been wonderful to see the support we have received from the bitcoin community.” Giving Tuesday is a celebratory holiday started in 2012, and is dedicated to counterbalancing the impact of other consumer-oriented holidays like Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The Bitcoin Store’s Stephen Macaskill believes that the charitable and optimistic bitcoin community will significantly support and expand the capacity of the RMcH in assisting ill children and families struggling to deal with financial instability. “The bitcoin community has a history of being very charitable, and we wanted to continue this pattern by supporting RMcH. They are providing valuable services for extremely ill children and their families, and we couldn’t be happier to see bitcoin make a positive impact on them this Giving Tuesday,” said Stephen Macaskill of The Bitcoin Store.

2016-10-31T23:09:27-04:00,It’s Bitcoin’s Birthday: Whitepaper Released 8 years Ago Today,Scott Fargo,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-birthday-whitepaper/,"Today is Bitcoin’s Birthday. Satoshi Nakamoto released the Bitcoin Whitepaper eight years ago today, on October 31, 2008. Also Read: Bitcoin and Blockchain Open New Management Frontiers At the time, many people who first read the paper became interested in the background technology, and several wanted to see it in a working state. It seems very few knew that was going to happen. Once Bitcoin launched in 2009, the biggest success story in digital money was launched. Satoshi launched Bitcoin as open source software so anyone could use it, fork it and update it. At first, the early adopters were mainly from the cryptography community like Hal Finney, the recipient of the very first bitcoin transaction. Nick Szabo and Wei Dai were also early adopters, with Szabo having developed “bit gold” prior to the Bitcoin whitepaper’s release. Wei Dai is the creator of b-money another precursor to Bitcoin. Bitcoin’s adoption was a steady progress as more people began to find out about it and experiment with everything from forking and making their own coins to mining technology. You can read the full white paper here. “Abstract. A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online
 payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a
 financial institution. Digital signatures provide part of the solution, but the main
 benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent double-spending.
 We propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer network.
 The network timestamps transactions by hashing them into an ongoing chain of
 hash-based proof-of-work, forming a record that cannot be changed without redoing
 the proof-of-work. The longest chain not only serves as proof of the sequence of
 events witnessed, but proof that it came from the largest pool of CPU power. As
 long as a majority of CPU power is controlled by nodes that are not cooperating to
 attack the network, they’ll generate the longest chain and outpace attackers. The
 network itself requires minimal structure. Messages are broadcast on a best effort
 basis, and nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the longest
 proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone.” While thinking about Bitcoin’s Birthday, it is apparent that Bitcoin means many things to many people. Some see it as a store of value, having at the time of publishing an $11.1 Billion market cap it certainly is one. At the same time, others see it as a transaction system that enables people to buy and sell goods and services with minimal friction. Alternatively, others focus the underlying technology of Bitcoin and its blockchain technology as the true value, with unlimited uses from storing data to improving bank transfers. Many see it as all those things and more. They use it to buy goods and services from an ever-growing list of merchants and vendors, to investing part of their earnings in bitcoin to hold value. People in countries with unstable or low-value currencies use bitcoin to move their money and to protect their wealth. Others use Bitcoin to protect their money from governments who are more and more prone to seizing funds of its citizens. Additionally, Bitcoin’s censorship resistance gives the disadvantaged, or those under oppressive governments, a way to make themselves heard. Bitcoin has come a long way since Satoshi introduced the whitepaper and launched the genesis block. The Bitcoin processing network of miners and pools is one of the most robust networks backing any system in the world. While there is centralization, miners from all over the world participate in the network. The network of nodes hovers around the 5k to 6k range with several different versions of node software represented. Bitcoin core, the main Satoshi client, comprises 84 percent of all nodes at press time. Happy Birthday Bitcoin! You have grown and fought to become something that not only frees people but allows them to be their own banks, be in charge of their financial future. Moreover, you have allowed a voice to those who don’t have one and given an outlet to those in need. The Bitcoin industry continues to get large amounts of capital influx on both bitcoin value, new companies, and investment in the ecosystem. Furthermore, Bitcoin has spawned a myriad of coins from Litecoin to Zcash. Smart technologies, contracts and more have grown on the blockchain, and on other coins like Ethereum and RSK. Moving forward, we all look forward to what Bitcoin will achieve in the next 8 years. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin’s 8th Birthday? Let us know in the comments section.

2016-10-31T15:00:33-04:00,Bitcoin and Blockchain Open New Management Frontiers,Julio Gil-Pulgar,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-blockchain-frontiers-management/,"Bitcoin, the blockchain, artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things and other Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies are disrupting everything around us. In particular, they are disrupting the way we manage people and businesses. Furthermore, they are changing management approaches and fostering new business process creation. Also read: Ernst & Young Report: Prepare for Blockchain ‘Critical Mass’ We have already experienced profound change in response to an eruption of new technologies. For example, the Industrial Revolution that started in the 1760s brought new production processes and changed management science. Certainly, management science existed before the Industrial Revolution. This fact is demonstrated by, for example, the existence of the Egyptian pyramids and the Great Wall of China. However, the Industrial Revolution led to new management theories, culminating with Frederick Taylor’s principles of scientific management. These principles include large-scale manufacturing and assembly-line production. They emphasize the rationalization and standardization of work through time and motion studies, division of labor, work measurement, and piece-rate wages. Then, in the mid-1990s, computers and the Internet propelled the Third Industrial Revolution. Exploiting the prevalence of information technologies, managers reengineered business processes. Reengineering, as defined by Dr. Michael Hammer and Dr. James Champy, is: “The fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of the business process to achieve dramatic improvements in critical contemporary measures of performance, such as cost, quality, service, and speed.” Now, the Fourth Industrial Revolution, i.e.: Industry 4.0, brings deeper change. As Klaus Schwab, Executive Chairman, World Economic Forum, declared, “One of the main features of the Fourth Industrial Revolution is that it does not change what we are doing, it changes us.” Blockchain could bring pervasive change at a magnitude and speed never before experienced. “On the business side, it drastically modifies customer expectations, product enhancement, collaborative innovation and organizational forms,” according to the European Commission. To exploit the power of emerging new technologies, leaders and managers must become more sophisticated at innovation management. Bitcoin and its blockchain are driving innovation across several industries. Therefore, it is imperative that managers become proficient at handling new concepts. These include the technology itself: trustless, distributed, permissionless, immutable, borderless, decentralized, and open source. Thanks to these concepts, many executives and entrepreneurs envision the future corporation through the prism of open innovation and blockchain. “Those that will succeed will be those that are best able to integrate innovation systematically into all aspects of the organization, to drive a higher rate of innovation in new business areas, and to manage innovation resources effectively and flexibly in a truly globalized and decentralized world,” concludes a report from Arthur D. Little. Moreover, the advent of smart contracts that can control the millions of interconnected smart devices, which execute transactions without human intervention, are requiring innovators to be able to design, deliver and manage smarter products. To achieve these objectives, IBM has developed a new approach, insight and product innovation (IPI). Specifically, emerging technologies combined with blockchain-based smart contracts are altering the way companies manage key processes, such as finances, logistics, audits, and trade. They are even reshaping the corporate structure. Thus, to remain competitive, companies are feverishly trying to gain expertise to harness the this power. For instance, “Big Four” companies are working towards bringing blockchain-based technologies and services to their clients. Deloitte is working with startup Bloq “to develop blockchain-related prototypes addressing digital identity, digital banking, cross-border payments, loyalty and rewards, as well as products for the investment management and insurance sectors.” Deloitte is also combining cognitive technologies, the Internet of Things, and blockchain, through its Deloitte Catalyst initiative. Deloitte CEO Cathy Engelbert said, “Deloitte Catalyst is enabling Deloitte and our clients to more easily tap the power of innovation.” Similarly, Ernst and Young is focusing on building blockchain-based solutions and prototypes. In this program, EY is collaborating with several blockchain forerunners: Adjoint, BlockVerify, Bitfury, BTL Group Ltd., Jaak, and Tallystiks. For 2016, EY’s program has been exploring blockchain applications in digital rights management for the media and entertainment sectors, and energy trading for the power and energy sectors. Also, PwC is partnering with Blockstream to introduce blockchain solutions to its clients around the world. “Together, PwC and Blockstream will help clients by collaborating on existing solutions and developing offerings to enable companies to meet new competition, adapt to disruptive market forces and lead innovation,” said Alex Fowler, SVP, Blockstream, announcing the partnership. Certainly, the Fourth Industrial Revolution presents huge opportunities and challenges all around, particularly in the production and distribution of wealth. In this regard, Bitcoin and its blockchain are playing a vital role. However, to enhance these opportunities and minimize these challenges, management science must be adapted to enable innovators to collaborate and reimagine new business processes.

2016-10-31T10:48:03-04:00,No Bitcoin Treasure Island yet as Iceland’s Pirate Party Falls Short,William Suberg,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-pirate-party-iceland-fail/,"Iceland’s Pirate Party has won 14.5 percent of the vote in the country’s general election, topping its forecasts but falling short of a majority. Also read: Pirate Party Gains Favor as Trust in Iceland Government Crumbles The much-championed movement gained seven seats in the Icelandic parliament, more than trebling its presence for the next term to ten. Until the weekend, it held only three seats.  Polls leading up to the election placed the Pirates at between 18 and 30% of the vote, with a top score likely leading to a coalition-based majority in parliament. Speaking after the results came through, the party’s leading light Birgitta Jónsdóttir struck a realistic tone. “Our internal predictions showed 10 to 15 percent, so this is at the top of the range,” she explained to Reuters. “We knew that we would never get 30 percent.” Iceland’s troubled incumbent government and this year’s election campaign has been of special interest to the cryptocurrency community. As part of its mantra, the Pirate Party advocates use of Bitcoin and implies the relaxation of Iceland’s hard-and-fast ban on its use. Jónsdóttir previously referred to a desire to turn the country into a “Switzerland of bits” should the party gain control.  The 14.5% result suggests that the Pirates will nonetheless wield noticeable power in coalition with other minority parties. The election produced other surprise results, with the Progressive Party losing 11 seats and brand new Regeneration party entering the political arena with 7 seats and 10.4% of the vote. The most recent updates suggest the close-run contest is producing problems for the winning parties, with the prospect of complex coalition talks in store. Jónsdóttir’s language meanwhile signals a clear contrast to the establishment more than ever. In the days prior to the election, she likened her role of guiding the Pirates to political power to that of a hacker. (She previously expressed her distaste for being referred to as ‘leader’ of the party.) “I definitely approach this job from the perspective of the hacker,” she said. “I don’t want to learn what isn’t possible, because as soon as I know about limitations, I start to respect them. It’s better to pretend you don’t know the limitations, so you can break them.” Regret at the results meanwhile is by no means confined to one section of society. Young voters who came out in force to support the Pirates have been vocal about the need for Iceland’s political situation to change radically. “I’m really sad,” one student told UK newspaper the Guardian. “This is our next generation that is taking the country to the next level. But they keep voting for the criminals we have here.” What do you think about the election results? Let us know in the comments section below.

2016-10-29T06:00:09-04:00,Barry Silbert Reveals 10 Bitcoin Predictions for 2017,Allen Scott,https://news.bitcoin.com/barry-silbert-bitcoin-predictions-2017/,"Expect 2017 to be a very good year for Bitcoin’s price. That’s according to prominent Bitcoin investor Barry Silbert, who shared his ten predictions for the upcomming year. Also read: Did Barclays Just Declare War on Bitcoin Users? Silbert, founder and CEO of Digital Currency Group (DCG), recently shared his top ten predictions for 2017 at DCG’s annual Bitcoin & Blockchain Summit. Overall, DCG is excited about applying Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain technology to trade finance, supply chain, identity and verification, cross-border payments, and as a speculative investment.  10. Bitcoin as a store-of-value reemerges as a key theme  Bitcoin has been dubbed “digital gold” and for good reason. Silbert expects traditional investors to start taking Bitcoin more seriously and adding it to their portfolios.  9. Bitcoin becomes more accessible to retail and institutional investors via ETF(s)  Bitcoin ETFs have huge potential to bring institutional investors into Bitcoin. While Silbert’s own GBTC and SolidX’s XBTC are already making Bitcoin more palatable to traditional investors, the much anticipated “COIN” ETF and others should help bridge the gap between cryptocurrency and legacy finance.  8. Cross border payments/remittances using Bitcoin will hit $1 billion run rate Remittances are one of Bitcoin’s most promising use-cases, as they are cheaper and faster compared to legacy service providers. Bitcoin remittances could unseat incumbents such as Western Union as Bitcoin infrastructure continues to improve. This comes alongside plummeting smartphone technology costs around the globe, solving the proverbial “last mile” problem. 7. Exponential Bitcoin transaction growth in India, Japan & Middle East Bitcoin’s global transaction volume has been on a steady incline since its beginnings. Moreover, tech-focused countries like India — where mobile commerce is booming — saw some robust growth in Bitcoin adoption lately. 6. Explosion of blockchain POCs focusing on supply chain The blockchain hype has permeated into almost every industry. One key area where blockchain technology could be beneficial is the supply chain and global trade. In fact this industry is already testing and implementing blockchain technology. For example, IBM and Tsinghua University in China just partnered up to improve food quality through the supply chain. 5. Identity solution competition heats up…but no leader emerges Identity on the Bitcoin blockchain is a touchy subject. But blockchain ID solutions could indeed solve many real life problems. These could include anything from verifying your identity to registering millions of undocumented people around the globe — something the UN is currently looking into.  4. SEC comes down hard on ICOs  It’s no secret the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is aware of Bitcoin. But some have warned the regulator’s next move is to close in on ICOs (initial coin offerings). The SEC could deem these as securities that may be subject to regulation. Although many in the cryptocurrency space ignore these warnings, they currently do so at their own risk.  3. First >$50 mm M&A transaction  The Bitcoin space has already seen some notable million-dollar mergers and acquisitions. Thus, topping $50 million is not out out of the question — particularly as the nascent cryptocurrency industry grows and matures.  2. Micropayment models materialize Bitcoin micropayment solutions are already being integrated into web-browsers, data-storage, social media platforms, and more. Micropayments — as small as a fraction of a cent — could finally be sent through the internet using bitcoin. This could flip the ad revenue model on its head through disintermediation. It could also pay content creators as well as consumers directly. 1. Bitcoin price on 12/31/2017 will be “higher” Silbert has been noted to make bullish regarding Bitcoin’s price in the past. Given the currency’s stellar performance the past few years, the price could certainly go “higher” if not to the moon.  Finally, DCG adds that it’s doesn’t yet buy into the hype around some bleeding edge technologies. The group lists Ethereum, “Smart” smart contracts, decentralized autonomous organizations, and ICOs as some of the technologies that have yet to prove themselves in the real world. Given last summer’s DAO debacle, however, this comes as no surprise.  Besides being named Entrepreneur of the Year by Ernst & Young and Crain’s, and making Fortune’s “40 Under 40” list, Silbert is a prominent investor in the Bitcoin space. He has injected millions into numerous Bitcoin startups including Coinbase, Ripple, and BitPay. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group also comprises Grayscale Investments (GBTC), Genesis Trading, CoinDesk, and a portfolio of over 80 investments in 20 countries.  Do you agree with these predictions?

2016-10-29T04:23:08-04:00,Bitcoin Core 0.13.1 Enables SegWit to Ease Block Sizes,Scott Fargo,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-core-0-13-1-released-segwit/,"Amid a spike in transactions and price hike, the Bitcoin Core team has released its version 0.13.1 update. Notably, this release is the first to implement Segregated Witness transactions in the Bitcoin protocol. While controversial, SegWit is one step towards freeing up a degree of block space. Also Read: Bitcurex Forced to Shut Down After $1.5 million Theft Bitcoin has suffered full blocks and backlogs intermittently over the past year, with a recent spike in the last several days. While resolved for now, the slowdown in transaction confirmations understandably upsets many people trying to move bitcoins around. No matter what side of the block size issue you’re on, Bitcoin’s ability to scale is paramount. Bitcoin Core release 0.13.1 introduces the next SegWit phase. One of its many technical improvements is the ability to fit almost 2MB of transactions per block. Many estimates put the total block size, with SegWit, at about 1.7mb. SegWit will not activate until November 15th at soonest, when signaling will begin. SegWit requires 95% of miners to use Core or a compliant client. However, there’s also a well-documented rift between miners and the Core devs. Currently, the 0.13.1 Core client runs on just over 8% of the nodes on the network. Other parts of the SegWit soft-fork address issues such as transaction malleability, increased security for multisig, script versioning and linear scaling of sighash operations. The multisig security update is a good addition, especially with so many exchange and Bitcoin company hacks. If it’s able to strengthen their security in any way, it will be a big help. All of these functions are notable as some add layers to make it easier for side-chains like the Lightening Network and Thunder Network to connect and work with the main Bitcoin chain. SegWit may have a tough time reaching 95% of nodes, miners and pools. This is because currently there are many who are unhappy with the base block size not being raised as well. Several alternatives, such as Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Unlimited, normally add features from Core releases as well as their own block size increase — and in some case other features. It’s going to be interesting to see if enough miners and mining pools will follow with the update. The new features 0.13.1 brings (including SegWit) may be beneficial. However the overall animosity among those with differing views on how and when the base block size should increase could delay or even derail it in the end. Bitcoin.com will bring you more information on SegWit as well as info on the block size discussion and more, so stay tuned. What’s your opinion on the new release? Does it solve Bitcoin’s scaling problem in any meaningful way? Let’s hear your thoughts. Image Source: BitNodes, Huffington Post There are no bigger Bitcoin believers than the Bitcoin.com team.

2016-10-28T19:55:43-04:00,"Switzerland’s SBB Railway Offers Bitcoin at 1,000 Kiosks",Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/switzerlands-sbb-railway-bitcoin-kiosks/,"Swiss railway system SBB will soon offer Bitcoin sales through its train ticket machines. On November 11 those with a Switzerland-based phone number and a QR readable wallet will be able to purchase the cryptocurrency from associated stations. Also read: Switzerland Won’t ‘Obstruct’ Bitcoin Startups, Eases Regulations The SBB railway service has one of Europe’s busiest international border stations. Now the company will offer bitcoin at ticket kiosks — due to its current popularity in the region. SBB said in Switzerland there is an “increasing number of places accepting bitcoin.” The company is selling the cryptocurrency in increments between CHF 20 and CHF 500. However the station itself will not be accepting bitcoin for train tickets.  The Swiss Federal Railways-owned SBB explains on its website how to top up a bitcoin wallet using any SBB ticket machine. Users simply select “mobile top up” and select bitcoin on the kiosk’s interface. Then users scan their wallet’s QR code and select the amount they’d like to purchase. After confirming the amount, Swiss residents must provide a valid phone number and then a security code (mTAN) it sends to the phone.  SBB has a significant distribution network with over 1,000 ticket machines. According to the publication Handelszeitung, the kiosks will charge a 6% fee on top of bitcoin sales. Handelszeitung said Zug company SweePay initiated the bitcoin kiosk deal. Credit card payments are currently not available, but that could change in the future. There is also a set maximum of 5,000 Swiss francs for bitcoin purchases per year.  The national railway confirmed with Handelszeitung that kiosk sales mark the beginning of a two-year test run. The Swiss news outlet reported SBB wants to see whether or not there is a substantial market for cryptocurrency purchases. Spokesperson Christian Ginsig told newspaper Der Bund that for now, users cannot obtain tickets using the digital currency. “It is a niche business for SBB,” Ginsig detailed. “SBB tickets cannot be paid with the virtual currency,” the SBB spokesperson added. SweePay was instrumental in creating the partnership. Zug is a well-known city in Switzerland with a significant Bitcoin community. Otherwise known as “Crypto-Valley”, the city believes it is the Silicon Valley of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology. Back in early May, the city of Zug revealed it would be testing a system that accepts bitcoin for government services. This would allow Zug citizens to pay for public services using bitcoin, but with the possibility of altcoins in the future. “We want to express our openness for the new technologies and to gain their own experience at an early stage. And we will invite FinTech companies in the Zug region to exchange ideas with the city council. It is our goal to get a better understanding of their needs for an optimal development in our living and economic area,” said Zug city council president Dolfi Müller.  The sale of bitcoin throughout Switzerland’s busiest railway stations will give cryptocurrency advocates more locations to purchase. If the niche program succeeds, as is very possible, SBB may enable ticket purchase with the cryptocurrency in the near future. For now, though the availability throughout its 1,000+ kiosks is a great start. What do you think about SBB enabling Bitcoin sales through its ticket kiosks? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-10-28T18:04:30-04:00,Bitcoin’s Price Value Is Racing Upwards,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoins-price-value-racing-upwards/,"Over the course of October Bitcoin’s price has been on a tear, rising in value. In the first week, Bitcoin.com predicted bullish indicators as the price ramped up to $630 USD per BTC at the time. Now the value of the cryptocurrency is slowly edging towards the $700 mark and was battling resistance at $690 at press time. Also read: MGT Capital & Bitmain Focus On U.S.-Based Bitcoin Mining The value of Bitcoin has continued to climb, breaking an array of price points all week long. Technical indicators show the bull run will continue with trend lines showing no signs of immediate correction. Volume is high, and both the 100 Simple Moving Average (SMA) and 200 SMA show little resistance against the bullish pressure. Bitcoin dominance is up at 82.6 percent with over $78 million in 24-hour trading volume.  Over the past three days, there has been some volatility, and there is plenty of room for intra-range day-trading. A few days ago saw the price vary between $685 to a low of $675. Fibonacci trend lines suggest the price rise looks to move forward and we could see the $725-750 range by next week if momentum keeps going.  If a pullback happens, deeper corrections look to stall at the $675 price range. However, the moving average shows no signs of a drawback at the present time. The Stochastic indicator shows buying pressure is healthy for the time being, and bearish downturns will be more likely when the value is above $700 price ranges. News has been largely optimistic the past few weeks, with many announcements and Bitcoin companies receiving capital injections. Bitpay has initiated a deal with WeFunder so the investment platform can accept Bitcoin. Alongside this news, the firm has also added Intel grade software into the company’s Copay wallet platform. The financial consultancy firm Needham & Company also recently revised its Bitcoin value projections for Q4 of 2016. Needham Analyst Spencer Bogart detailed that the rise is due to adoption growing increasingly faster, with code improvements on the horizon. One factor on the way is the integration of SegWit into the Bitcoin 0.13.1 protocol. On November 15, miners will be able to signal whether or not they agree with the soft fork. On top of this, the community seems to be positive towards the rally. Investor Barry Silbert recently explained ten reasons why he thinks Bitcoin will grow stronger. Furthermore, MGT Capital Investments John McAfee aims to bring more Bitcoin mining operations to the U.S. with Bitmain as a partner. Overall, the industry and community have been very positive. However, on October 25-26 a lot of people had significant issues with confirmation times over the network. The issue has again sparked a heated debate about the block size and possible solutions.  The weekly and 24-hour candle charts show a continued bull run with little resistance. A lot of people are pointing to China and the continued downward spiral of the Chinese yuan. Chinese Bitcoin trading has definitely ignited a flame and continues to strengthen. Long-term projections could very well top the $750 range by next week.  Bear scenario: Term support could find a floor at $665-675 if a correction takes place. If the price is currently overbought (which technical indicators say it is not) then the price should see a downturn over the next day or so. Bull scenario: If buy pressure continues the price should easily break into the $725-750 range. The ascending channel pattern shows a little resistance at the $700 range at present, but the buying volume continues to eat through the order books.

2016-10-28T12:00:12-04:00,MIT Launches Blockcerts Certification Using Bitcoin,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/mit-blockcerts-certification-bitcoin/,"Back in June MIT Media Lab tested certification authentication using the Bitcoin blockchain. After working on research and development for over a year, the school organization has released an open standard for digital academic certificates called Blockcerts. Also read:MGT Capital & Bitmain Focus On U.S.-Based Bitcoin Mining Blockcerts is a MIT Media Lab project utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain for digital notarization. Developers said the platform also allows a decentralized credentialing system. The open source application can be used for “academic, professional, and workforce credentialing.” Blockcerts maintains its foundations as an open software application that allows any individual to take control of their credentials with an immutable method. By putting its application on the Bitcoin blockchain, the project builds a new trust infrastructure. Bitcoin’s protocol removes the dependence on third party arbitration which is impermanent and filled with complication. MIT Media Lab explained the Bitcoin blockchain replaces centralized entities with a “permanent and tamper-proof infrastructure of trust.”  Moreover, the digital ledger is fully transparent, and data can be shared among the public for verification purposes. This gives individuals their own personal notary, and the ability to control their official records. Blockcerts website explains:  The research team: Juliana Nazaré, J.Philipp Schmidt, and Kim Hamilton Duffy had written various papers on the subject leading to the launch. Schmidt’s paper proposed the technology could replicate how certification took place in the past. In historical times “journeymen carpenters carried around their books of stamps and references,” explained Schmidt. With distributed ledger technology available to anyone, people can leverage the Bitcoin blockchain for record keeping.    “Using the blockchain and strong cryptography, it is now possible to create a certification infrastructure that puts us in control of the full record of our achievements and accomplishments. It will allow us to share a digital degree with an employer while giving the employer complete trust that the degree was in fact issued to the person presenting it,” stated Schmidt. The MIT Media Lab project has already deployed a few instances of blockchain-based digital certificate verification. In October of 2015, the group issued certificates to Media Lab alumni who attended the Lab’s 30th anniversary. The organization Learning Machine also issued HR certificates to employees. MIT’s Global Entrepreneurship Bootcamp workshop in Seoul, South Korea in March 2016 published digital verification using the system. Lastly, Laboratorio para la Ciudad issued digital certificates to workshop participants in Mexico City in September 2015.  The MIT Media Lab developers are quite pleased with the project. This certification process shows the importance of a distributed ledger with immutable permanence. Blockchain certification using Blockcerts is tamper-proof and cannot be updated or edited. However, certification issuers can revoke certain records “by spending the revocation address that they generated for a particular recipient.”  The new process shows a well-researched and developed application that brings a different element to the Bitcoin landscape. The idea of notarization using the Bitcoin blockchain has been known for quite some time, but MIT Media Lab put the idea to work. By building a system that includes step-by-step instructions that are open to anyone, more employers and universities may try the new certification process. The protocol could prevent significant transcript errors as the organization explains stating:    “When certification systems are not working well, the consequences can be more than just inefficient, such as the cumbersome and expensive process of requesting a university transcript: they can be disastrous, such as when a refugee is unable to provide a certificate of completed study and is therefore prevented from continuing her education. Digital systems could help in both of these situations.” What do you think about MIT Media Lab’s Blockcerts platform? Let us know in the comments below.

Also read: Cannabis Security Firm Goes Bitcoin to Solve Industry’s Banking Problem The scheme, finalized for California and Oregon with further states to follow, is “the first completely sanctioned credit card solution for the Marijuana Industry,” the company states in a press release issued on October 27. The identity of the merchant processor is unknown at press time, but operates as an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and “unlike most merchants… accepts and fully acknowledges. . .engagement with State licensed legal [Marijuana] Dispensaries,” FBC explains.  With the de facto legalization of many forms of cannabis in several US states in 2016, revenues from sales have topped $5 billion, a figure FBC suggests is likely only to grow next year.  “These changes are helping the medical cannabis industry to prosper now that federal policies allow dispensaries to sell, grow, or possess cannabis while compliant with state laws,” the release continues. Further expansion to other states will depend on “legal opinions” given by the merchant processor. “[FBC] will only provide these services where federal policies allow our business model to proceed for dispensaries that are fully compliant with state and country laws, rules and regulations,” it adds. The increasingly relaxed environment in the US surrounding cannabis has gone hand in hand with the advantages offered by blockchain technology. Earlier this month, a dozen medicinal growers announced a scheme with Medicinal Genomics to track plant strains on the blockchain to monitor the quality of the market product. US election day, meanwhile, could mark a further turning point for marijuana — particularly in California. November 8 will see a vote on legalizing recreational use of the drug beyond prescribed medical use, and is widely forecast to be successful.  The Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA) would allow anyone over the age of 21 to possess up to one ounce and cultivate up to six plants at home.  “If we’re successful, it’s the beginning of the end of the war on marijuana,” lieutenant governor of California Gavin Newsom commented to the New York Times this week.

“If California moves, it will put more pressure on Mexico and Latin America writ large to reignite a debate on legalization there.” Meanwhile, the FBC has a long-term goal of providing a complete package for the fledgling industry using standards compliant with all relevant state laws. “[The] company can now provide financial services not typically available from conventional banks,” it adds.

Also read:Â $35k For Cotton Marks World First Interbank Blockchain Trade Stash is a privacy-focused Bitcoin company founded by Cliff Baltzley and Chris Odom. The companyâs first product, the Stash Node Pro, will be the worldâs first Open-Transactions hardware device. The plug-and-play device is a Bitcoin full node roughly five-by-five inches in size.  With the typical capabilities of a full node, the productsâ privacy-centric features are unique. Stash Node Pro will include Open-Transactions — which has untraceable cash, digital checks, recurring payments, basket currencies, bid/ask market exchange, and a secure end-to-end encrypted messaging system. All the features included giveÂ Stash Node owners a complete cryptographicÂ resource library. “We’re reducing the need for reliance on trusted third parties,” says Chris Odom, Stash CTO and co-founder. “All money services existing today can be replaced by consumer devices. Through strong cryptography, parties can transact directly and privately with one another.â  Stash saidÂ members of itsÂ staff have been coding rigorously for over six years to provide this software to the public. Stash Node Pro is a âpowerful turnkey transaction server and mobile financial platform, built on Open-Transactions and the blockchain,â says CEO Cliff Baltzley. The startup believesÂ consumers have been looking for a turnkey device that is accessible from their mobile wallets. With the Stash Node Pro, the developers say “among other things, it’s a bank in a box; your own, personal bank.”  The Bitcoin full node contains a self-hosted copy of the blockchain and can support any block size in the future. The startup has also designed a stand-alone mobile app which can pair with the Stash Node Pro. This gives the user access to their own blockchain copy at all times. In essence, the entire platform gives financial control to the owner by enabling a trustless device with censorship resistant capability. Currently, there isn’t a node on the market that has Open-Transaction software integration. The team believes these features add significant value to the Stash node, alongside a pairable mobile wallet interface. The Stash mobile wallet also utilizes BIP47 payment codes and enables âtwo-way Bitcoin addresses with fungibility and full on-chain privacy.â The founders of Stash believe that the public has desired a platform with a broad range of cryptographic procedures for quite some time. Stash CEO Cliff Baltzley explained: Stash details that they are developing ârevolutionary featuresâ with an architecture based on freedom and prosperity. In the future, the team plans on implementing more protocols to the Stash financial infrastructure. Innovations coming soon include trustless coin mixing, multi-signature technology, cold storage applications, SMS integrations, multi-currency support, payments through SMS texting, and much more. The startup Stash hopes this product and its upcoming innovations will help spread âtrue financial autonomy.â The company will be accepting a limited number of pre-orders for the founder’s edition of the Stash Node Pro. Pre-orders are currently available for purchase with Bitcoin only, and free FedEx shipping is included. The startup says it has quite a lot of devices in stock and will begin shipping orders on November 18. Stash looks forward to providing a node with the foundations of privacy in mind and believes consumers will as well.  Would you buy and run a Stash Node Pro? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-10-27T08:00:49-04:00,MGT Capital & Bitmain Focus On U.S.-Based Bitcoin Mining,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/mgt-capital-bitmain-us-bitcoin-mining/,"MGT Capital Investments, led by John McAfee, has just signed a letter of intent with the mining firm Bitmain Technologies Limited. The collaboration aims to focus on building North American Bitcoin opportunities. Also read: John McAfee to Join ‘Blockchain: Money’ Conference in London The joint venture between MGT and Bitmain will begin by focusing efforts on a state of the art Bitcoin mining pool. The companies said the “McAfee Pool” will have many benefits that other mining pools do not include. Some of the features will be an advanced user interface, and network protection and security curated by MGT’s cybersecurity framework. Beijing-based Bitmain will offer mining expertise by leveraging its worldwide leadership within the Bitcoin mining and hardware ecosystem. The firm already maintains one of the largest mining pools Antpool, and professional grade equipment with its Antminer series. John McAfee, Executive Chairman of MGT, commented during the announcement stating: “Our partnership with an iconic name such as Bitmain Technologies is a major milestone for MGT as it executes it plan to become the major player in bitcoin throughout the western hemisphere.— This partnership will go a long way towards making MGT a leader in the fastest growing segment of financial and industrial cybersecurity.”  MGT Capital Investments has been making headlines within the Wall Street environment and throughout the cryptocurrency industry. The firm is dedicated to acquiring intellectual property assets and technologically beneficial protocols.  The company also recently revealed its “Sentinel” technology. Sentinel is focused on the security of corporations and enterprise organizations from malicious hacking. MGT is currently working on acquiring D-Vasive, a provider of anti-spy software, and Demonsaw, a file sharing software platform.  Additionally, the company has a portfolio which includes social, casino and gaming platforms. Moreover, MGT has a stake in DraftDay.com a leading fantasy sports platform with wagering capabilities. McAfee is also a believer in blockchain technology and the Bitcoin protocol. He first hinted about acquiring a mining operation this past summer.  The former anti-virus tycoon will also be keynoting at Bitcoin.com’s Blockchain: Money Conference, speaking about these emerging technologies.  The collaboration between MGT and Bitmain could be a powerful combination. The Bitcoin mining realm is changing nearly every day, and there is a significant concentration in China. With Bitmain’s help, MGT could create a major mining facility in America. There are a few operations in the U.S. including Bitfury’s Georgian data facility, among others.  MGT seems like it has its targets set on innovative and emerging technologies configured to disrupt traditional frameworks. With McAfee behind the helm, the staunch libertarian’s values may shine through the business.  A Bitcoin operation could give the firm significant leverage as the world’s payment system is changing for the better. Whatever the case may be, MGT wants to be on the forefront of this revolutionary economy.  What do you think about MGT’s partnership with Bitmain? Let us know in the comments below.

2016-10-27T07:47:09-04:00,Did Barclays Just Declare War on Bitcoin Users?,William Suberg,https://news.bitcoin.com/barclays-declare-war-bitcoin/,"UK bank Barclays has suspended the account of local cryptocurrency news resource Coinjournal without warning or explanation, it emerged today. Also read: BitPay Offers Financial Services to RT Following Bank Account Freeze In a tweet earlier Thursday, journalist Kyle Torpey stated it “seemed” the bank had suspended Coinjournal’s account “for using and being associated with [Bitcoin].”  The move follows similar complaints about Barclays’ blocking transactions related to Bitcoin trading this week. The bank is already known for its sporadic shutdowns of accounts associated with entities dealing in Bitcoin. Speaking to Bitcoin.com, Coinjournal founder Oliver Carding said the decision had taken the business by surprise. “Considering the size of or business… and the amount of money involved, we are surprised that we’ve been considered high risk,” he said, adding that Barclays gave “no warning” of the impending block. “When asked for more information about which rule we’d broken they would not give us explicit information and referred us to their terms and conditions,” he explained. It’s not just businesses which Barclays has stung with its latest move. One Localbitcoins trader told Bitcoin.com that transactions from their private account to users settling trades had been disrupted since the beginning of the week. Having received a message via the bank’s online banking service stating transactions were being “delayed,” a telephone conversation saw Barclays avoid direct comment. “They did not even mentioned fraud or anything; the last representative I spoke to didn’t give a proper answer,” the user said. “They just said that the account that I’m trying to send money too has been blocked and that there are issues with Barclays.” Elsewhere, Barclays has given mixed messages regarding its stance on blockchain technology. In contrast to its seemingly suspicious treatment of Bitcoin, the bank has joined many other legacy institutions in championing blockchain’s potential. In February, Head of Open Innovation Arian Lewis even went as far as to question “whether Barclays was really a tech company.” On the topic of Blockchain innovation in Africa, Lewis added that the technology “could be the most significant social and political innovation to impact Africa in 100 years.” However, such evangelism provides little meaning for the banks’ marooned account holders. “It’s a very familiar tale unfortunately and it’s a huge hindrance for adoption worldwide, not just in the U.K,” Carding concluded. He added Coinjournal was in the process of reaching out to contacts in the cryptocurrency space and hoped to have a resolution worked out in the coming weeks. In the meantime, the publication is soliciting bitcoin donations to help keep the website operating. What do you think about Barclays’ move to block Bitcoin-related accounts?

2016-10-27T06:00:18-04:00,Bitcoin is the Blockchain’s Killer Application,Elizabeth McCauley,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-blockchains-killer-application/,"Just a few months ago, I sat on a panel at the Blockchain New York Conference at PwC. As a panel, we discussed, “The Promise of “The Internet of Money” with a particular angle on whether or not Bitcoin is a distraction, or has merit moving forward. How could Bitcoin be a distraction?  Also read: Revolutionary Protocol: The Emergence of Bitcoin  Bitcoin is the blockchain’s killer application. As banks and larger financial institutions catch onto “the blockchain”, let’s not forget the application that made the blockchain become more of a household name.  For those who caught onto the Bitcoin movement in the earlier days, Bitcoin was a greater topic of conversation than its platform, the blockchain. It’s easy to run after the next flashy concept, but Bitcoin as a currency is just taking off in many regions of the world. For those naysayers, the bitcoin price is on an incline.  For some, paying in bitcoin is liberating. Apple and Venmo can only go so far to provide consumers with security and reach individuals around the globe. Certainly, some might argue that there are not enough on and off ramps in all parts of the world to the digital currency, but that certainly does not mean that there is no potential for Bitcoin to become mainstream.  If we remove our U.S., Canadian and European lenses, the picture of financial stability is entirely different in most parts of the world. In countries like Argentina, Venezuela, Greece, and India, bitcoin, as a currency, presents a needed solution to basic payment woes. Just this past July, Uber drivers in Argentina founded a needed solution through Xapo’s bitcoin debit card. The Argentinian government stepped in to stifle Uber’s business by closing off access to credit card services, yet Uber has successfully continued operating thanks to bitcoin. What about Argentina’s neighbor, Venezuela? With the country in a sharp economic downturn and thousands facing starvation, people are desperately looking for an alternative.   What about the picturesque country of Greece? The scenery certainly does not match the financial turmoil within, frequently characterized by Greece’s government seizing citizen bank accounts with often ulterior motives in paying off the national debt. In India, home to one-fifth of the global unbanked population, mobile wallet use is on the rise, and Bitcoin is a solution for individuals to opt into the international economy with limited capital. With the United States less than two weeks away from the presidential election, people inside and outside of the country are taking a close look at Bitcoin as an investment and mechanism for payment.  Imagine being barred from having a bank account due to your gender or race? In countries like Saudi Arabia, where women are banned from driving, Bitcoin serves as a gateway to financial freedom. What about the vast wealth discrepancies around the world? There is no minimum cash requirement to opt in when purchasing bitcoin. In most countries, just to secure a bank account, you need a sizable amount of capital to do so. With bitcoin, anyone can opt in with just a few cents.  This past May, BTCC CEO and Bitcoin Foundation Board Member, Bobby Lee, gave a compelling talk on “Why Bitcoin Makes Sense,” at Stanford Technology Ventures Program. Lee emphasized that Bitcoin makes sense for everyone around the world.  Now before claiming that Bitcoin is just a distraction or no longer relevant, what alternative is there that is global, decentralized, inclusive, and providing financial opportunity for the financially marginalized? The Bitcoin killer application continues to be a solid plan B, and I believe soon will be plan A for many.   What are your thoughts? Does Bitcoin still have merit?

2016-10-26T11:00:21-04:00,‘Friendliest’ Bitcoin Wallet iPayYou Now Sells Gift Cards,Jon Southurst,https://news.bitcoin.com/friendliest-wallet-ipayyou-gift-cards/,"User and newcomer-friendly wallet service iPayYou says it wants to help create a merchandising ecosystem for Bitcoin. To kick this off, it now allows users to buy gift cards from Amazon, Best Buy, iTunes and Starbucks. More retailers are coming within the month. Also read: $35k For Cotton Marks World First Interbank Blockchain Trade iPayYou CEO Gene Kavner explained to Bitcoin.com his company wants to solve what he calls Bitcoin’s “desolation problem”. It’s the problem many Bitcoin newcomers experience — now they have coins, where are they supposed to spend them? iPayYou functions as a regular online Bitcoin wallet. Its main selling point is user-friendliness — you don’t need to know anything about Bitcoin to use it. There’s no lengthy addresses or private key management. You can also send money to other users via email addresses or even Twitter. Notably, people can also cancel payments if they were sent in error — something definitely not available with standard Bitcoin transactions. Kavner said he wants iPayYou to be the “friendliest” Bitcoin Wallet. He started the company after seeing difficulties some newcomers have in comprehending Bitcoin and how it works. “It’s too complicated. I had to help people create wallet addresses, then they always lost their private keys,” he said. Then, he added, there’s the “desolation” problem. Creating an easy, simple ecosystem for spending bitcoins is key to adoption, he said. Selling gift cards for bitcoin gives users something immediately useful and versatile to do with their digial cash. In this sense, iPayYou is similar to other BTC-to-gift card services like Gyft and Purse.io. The difference is that iPayYou is primarily a Bitcoin wallet rather than a purchasing service that happens to accept Bitcoin. iPayYou will add more retailers’ cards as options over the coming month. For now, the service deals in U.S. gift cards only. If gift card holders decide they’d prefer BTC or USD, the company will buy them back for a restocking fee. However this applies only to cards iPayYou has sold. Users add value to their iPayYou wallets just as they would a Bitcoin exchange. That is, the company accepts bank transfer deposits in USD or bitcoin deposits the usual way. There are still KYC procedures for users wishing to connect bank accounts and ACH information. Within 30 days, Kavner said, iPayYou will connect to all U.S. banks for both USD deposits and withdrawals. iPayYou does not accept gift cards purchased elsewhere. This means people can’t simply buy a card from a convenience store and use it to buy bitcoins, as they do with services like Paxful. There’s a lot of security hassles to deal with in that space, Kavner said. That is, users can try to defraud the company by using fake or spent cards. “And every time something goes wrong, people will blame Bitcoin.” Starting immediately, iPayYou is selling cards from Amazon, iTunes, Best Buy and Starbucks. This means users have a pretty broad range of goods to purchase with bitcoin. If successful, it will be the start of the spending ecosystem Kavner seeks. Are gift cards a good starting point for a Bitcoin spending economy? Will you try out iPayYou, or do you prefer to hoard your coins? Let us know in the comments.

2016-10-26T06:00:56-04:00,Bitcoin Funding & Education For Zimbabwean Farmers,Jamie Redman,https://news.bitcoin.com/bitcoin-funding-zimbabwean-farmers/,"BitMari, the Pan-African Bitcoin wallet provider, is trying to popularize Bitcoin in the Zimbabwean region. Currently, the startup is working with the Zimbabwe Women Farmers Accelerator to raise cryptocurrency funds for the group’s cause. Also Read: The Amount of Bitcoin Is Scarcer Than We Think The startup BitMari is on a mission to leverage Bitcoin and blockchain protocols in order to streamline remittances to Africa from its diaspora. The company was founded in June of 2015 by Christopher Mapondera and Sinclair Skinner.  BitMari is currently working through regulatory policy across the region to lay the groundwork for its application services. In the meantime, the startup has started a crowdfund of US$22,500 to support Zimbabwean women farmers. BitMari’s crowdfunding goal is to raise Bitcoin for a hundred local women farmers in the Zimbabwean region. The mission is to issue BitMari wallets to ten farmers across ten provinces while removing third party intervention.  So far the crowdfunding effort has raised $17,000 of the $22,500 from eight backers. The Bitcoins will be redeemed for “farming inputs at selected suppliers nationwide.” After a successful season, the farmers will fund back the project and set up for the next wave of farmers. Zimbabwe’s economy has suffered widespread poverty and extreme unemployment for years. From 2003 to 2009 the Zimbabwean currency hyperinflated to a point where the country’s reserve notes became virtually worthless. In 2009 the state abandoned the Zimbabwe dollar — and began seeing economic progress immediately.  However, there is a lot of distrust towards the Zimbabwean banks and new bond note system. A writer named L.S.M Kabweza had suggested this past May that Bitcoin could remove the need for trust from the traditional system. Kabweza believes that tech can help Zimbabwe “in both a short and long term sense in its current predicament of a USD cash shortage and new bond notes that Zimbabweans are generally very skeptical about.” While raising the $17,000 in funds so far, BitMari is also educating locals on the many beneficial aspects of cryptocurrencies. The process is in collaboration with Agribank, that works with preferred suppliers and farming inputs. Additionally, The Women Farmers Land and Agriculture Trust – a small-scale farmers’ trust is being utilized as well. BitMari says it wants to raise Bitcoin awareness throughout the Pan African region, especially in communities that could benefit from its attributes. The startup explains that typically residents wouldn’t adopt a digital currency that hasn’t become a form of mainstream mobile payment services.  Helping fund the Zimbabwe Women Farmers Accelerator is a chance for farmers to receive funds from the diaspora, BitMari explains. The company believes if it becomes successful, Bitcoin could trump the Zimbabwean bond notes and become a solution to the cash crisis.
