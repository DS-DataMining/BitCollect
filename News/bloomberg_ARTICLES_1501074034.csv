2017-07-24T06:00:07.160Z,Bitcoin Split Is Nothing to Fear,"Aaron Brown
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-24/bitcoin-split-is-nothing-to-fear,"Over the last week, the price of Bitcoin crashed from around $2,400 to $1,800 on fears of a so-called hard fork, which is to say the digital currency would effectively split in two due to software upgrades at the end of the month that would create competing marketplaces. Potential and actual forks have roiled cryptocurrency prices regularly since the introduction of Bitcoin in 2009. The problem with most reporting of these events is that it treats cryptocurrencies as different from physical currencies, and a fork as a complicated technological disaster. After a fork, a currency exists in two or more incompatible forms. Two of the biggest forks for the U.S. dollar occurred in 1963 and 1971. In 1963, the U.S. passed the badly conceived Interest Equalization Tax on purchases of foreign securities by taxpayers. London banks quickly created “eurodollar” deposits,
            
                
                1
            
         dollar deposits outside the U.S. banking system, which were not subject to the tax.
            
                
                2
            
         A eurodollar is kind of like a dollar, except that it is not supported by the U.S. When there is more faith in banks than governments, eurodollars carry a lower interest rate than regular dollars because they are less subject to American jurisdiction. But when banks are troubled, eurodollars carry higher rates because the eurodollar banks might be unable to redeem deposits.
            
                
                3
            
         In 2008, when that possibility became real, the Federal Reserve supported eurodollars.
            
                
                4
            
         In 1971, the Reserve Primary Fund was formed. It was organized via a loophole in mutual fund rules, not as a money substitute. Regulators fought these funds for years before embracing them in the early 1980s. Purchase of money market shares was kind of like depositing money in a bank, except that the money market funds paid much higher rates,
            
                
                5
            
         and except that the deposit had no official support. Nevertheless, in 2008, the government decided to support money market funds.
            
                
                6
            
         Money market deposits are counted as dollars in the money supply according to M2, the most widely used measure. Obviously neither of these forks, nor many smaller forks over the years, led to the abandonment of the dollar. The fact that London banks or U.S. fund managers could create their own versions of dollars without Fed oversight didn’t cause problems.
            
                
                7
            
         It made dollars more valuable because different flavors worked better for different purposes. Cryptocurrencies have the opposite problem. Fear of forks makes it difficult to make routine technical changes. This conservatism is one of the factors fueling the growth of tokens that can be easily designed and updated to meet transactional needs, while tying their values to older cryptocurrencies, much like modern physical currencies began by tying their values to gold. The fear of forks springs from a deeper fear that cryptocurrency values will unravel quickly to zero. Sure, this could happen, but it happens all the time with physical currencies as well. There were at least 140 physical currencies in the world 100 years ago. Most evaporated without significant payment to holders. The Swiss franc was the best performer with only a 75 percent loss in value, followed by the dollar with a 95 percent loss and the pound at 98 percent.
            
                
                8
            
         Only a handful of other currencies have any value at all. A 95 percent depreciation over a century is only a 3 percent loss per year,
            
                
                9
            
         yet it is the rule, not the exception, that currencies evaporate due to hyperinflation, government default or expropriation, or a losing a war. People do not use them because they have faith in their long-term survival, but because they can facilitate transactions today. Bitcoin is far better protected against those four risks than any physical currency. The only thing it lacks is the imprimatur of a government -- or anything else. Does that give it a 3 percent chance of crashing to zero over the next year? That would put it around the historical loss from the best physical currencies. A 10 percent chance would make it roughly as risky as an average currency. Clearly, cryptocurrencies have far more short-term volatility in value than most physical currencies, but my estimate is that well-designed ones have much better chances of surviving a century -- or being bought out at significant value -- than the average physical currency.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-25/bofa-says-bitcoin-needs-acceptance-to-thrive-but-that-s-unlikely,"Bank of America Merrill Lynch is looking past the increase in bitcoin trading volume to caution against a surge in optimism surrounding the digital currency. ""A key step for bitcoin would be for it to become pledgeable collateral,"" Francisco Blanch, BofA’s head of Global Commodities and Derivatives Research, wrote in a note published Tuesday. ""However, large inherent risks to digital tokens such as fraud, hacking, theft, new protocol adoption, limited acceptance, and that it is not legal tender many places in the world make it an unlikely development."" Trading in bitcoin has surged in recent months to beyond $1 billion a day, at some points reaching above $2 billion, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. A proper store of value, though, also considers safety (think: volatility) and return, Blanch wrote. Read about CFTC approval of bitcoin options ""The more liquidity and scale bitcoin builds to, the lower the volatility over time,"" Blanch said. Still, bitcoin volatility remains well above that of emerging market currencies. And it’s not like the cryptocurrencies correlate with Group-of-10 currencies, gold, oil or equities either. Cryptocurrency returns, the third parameter Blanch wrote about, depend on price appreciation which ""will mostly depend on the faith placed by individuals, corporations, and financial institutions on this emerging technology."" Bitcoin is currently trading over $2,500 per coin, more than doubling its price since the start of the year. ""Most regulated financial institutions allow their clients to borrow against financial or physical assets, but we are not aware of any major institution that takes cryptocurrency as collateral at the moment,"" Blanch writes. That sentiment is in line with the view of Morgan Stanley analysts, who wrote in June that government acceptance would be required for cryptocurrency appreciation, at the cost of regulation."
2017-07-24T16:00:04.000Z,How Bitcoin's Boom Raised Risk of Currency Split: QuickTake Q&A,"Lulu Yilun Chen
         & Yuji Nakamura
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-24/how-bitcoin-s-boom-raised-risk-of-currency-split-quicktake-q-a,"Bitcoin has become so successful that the way it operates needs upgrading, and fast. Trouble is, there are opposing views on how to do that and no all-powerful administrative body to determine which method to adopt. After all, part of bitcoin’s allure is its lack of central oversight. The arguments between the different camps transcend the purely technical to encompass philosophy and politics, raising the prospect of the cryptocurrency splitting into two. Although the immediate threat of a split appears to have dissipated, another potential hurdle awaits in November. Bitcoin was built with security more in mind than the kind of volume its success has brought. To prevent counterfeiting, bitcoin transactions are verified by so-called bitcoin miners in batches called blocks. The blocks are then strung together to form the decentralized open ledger known as the blockchain that’s one of the currency’s biggest selling points. Worries about cyberattacks led the system’s designers to cap the size of blocks at 1 megabyte. But as bitcoin grew in popularity over the past nine years, transaction times and processing fees soared to record levels. The average time to confirm a bitcoin deal ballooned to six hours at one point this year from under 20 minutes, according to blockchain.info, which tracks bitcoin activity. The backlog of transactions rose to a record, pushing up fees as bitcoin holders offered miners increasing amounts to deal with their transactions sooner. In recent weeks, the congestion (and fees) have lightened significantly as some users have steered clear of the traffic jam. In one corner are the bitcoin miners, the thousands of individuals who form a vital part of the blockchain process by deploying their expensive, powerful computers to verify transactions. They support increasing the number of bitcoin transactions in each block. In the other corner are the so-called Core developers who have been instrumental in constructing bitcoin’s bug-proof system. Their proposal: Allow some data to be moved outside the main network, in effect creating multiple ledgers called sidechains. If the two camps follow their own proposals and reject a compromise, two versions of bitcoin’s blockchain would probably come into existence -- effectively splitting the cryptocurrency in two. It would send shock waves through the bitcoin community. Traders would have to quickly re-price the value of both versions, probably leading to massive volatility. Bitcoin exchanges alerted users about the potential, warning them to safeguard their bitcoin private keys -- the pin codes that guarantee ownership of particular bitcoins -- and to stop sending or receiving the currency in the event of a breakup. Its biggest competitor did. Ethereum, which oversees a digital currency known as ether, was divided in July 2016 in a bid to recover about $50 million worth of ether that had been hacked. A rift emerged in the community over whether it should honor the notion of an immutable blockchain. Two currencies emerged: ETH and ETC. Both have surpassed their pre-split price. In fact, ETH -- which doesn’t acknowledge the hack took place -- at one time surged to 80 percent of bitcoin’s market value. Yes, and one such proposal -- called SegWit2x -- has emerged as the most likely solution. It’s a combination of the Core developers’ suggestion (called SegWit, for Segregated Witness) and the miners’ proposal. A majority of miners agreed to adopt the technology, on condition that blocks be doubled to 2 megabytes. Opponents among the developers argue that increasing block sizes will leave too much power in too few hands, since the technology required will get more expensive. Miners fear that moving some of bitcoin’s workings off the main network will diminish their importance. For the time being, it looks like bitcoin might dodge the split. More than 93 percent of miners in July locked in support for the first necessary step in implementing SegWit2x, according to Coin Dance, a website that tracks adoption. It will take until the second week of August for SegWit to be fully adopted, assuming hackers don’t disrupt the process -- a genuine risk, developers say. Then, in November, bitcoin will face another challenge when some of the world’s biggest miners move to adopt phase two of the proposal, the doubling of the size of the block. That could lead to bitter disagreements. Miners and Core developers need each other to function, survive -- and prosper. Research analyst Ronnie Moas sees bitcoin’s scarcity and acceptance by investors doubling its value to $5,000 by next year, then surging to as much as $50,000 in the next decade. Miners are paid in new bitcoin. Then there’s the nine years of blood, sweat and tears, not to mention investment, that’s made bitcoin the world’s preeminent cryptocurrency. So far it’s been enough to counter the competing ideologies of what bitcoin should be. Created in 2009 by a person or a group under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, bitcoin initially attracted an array of figures including libertarians who wished to counter the control of sovereign regulators and central banks. One attraction is that, in contrast to limitless printed currencies, there can never be more than 21 million bitcoins. And as bitcoin’s market value has surged to $45 billion, the debate has intensified over whether it should embrace more mainstream capitalism or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon. More practically, the debate has revolved around whether bitcoin should become like gold and other assets that store value or develop as a payment system and platform for economic activity."

Sign up here to receive our newsletter. Digital currency investors and miners will be able to hedge the volatile assets under U.S. regulatory oversight for the first time in just a couple of months. The U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission granted LedgerX LLC, a cryptocurrency trading platform operator, registration as a clearing house for derivatives contracts settling in digital currencies, according to a statement by the regulators Monday. With the approval, LedgerX is set to become the first federally regulated digital currency options exchange and clearinghouse in the U.S. as interest and volatility in the method of exchange surges. “It’s an important milestone for the digital currency market broadly,” said Paul Chou, a former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. trader, who is LedgerX’s chief executive. “This will pave the way for others globally to look at the space and the appropriate way to regulate a new market like this.” The New York-based company plans to offer one to six month bitcoin-to-dollars options contracts in late September to early October, Chou said in a telephone interview. Contracts for other digital currencies including for Ethereum’s ether are expected to follow, as well as longer-term protection. The CFTC had granted LedgerX authorization to trade digital currencies earlier this month. The company, which is backed by Alphabet Inc.’s venture-capital arm, aims to provide institutional investors the ability to hedge against price swings in digital currencies in the same way they protect against volatility in other assets. Read more on how bitcoin’s boom raised the risk of a split Other platforms that offer options trading are Bitcoin Mercantile Exchange, owned by Seychelles-incorporated HDR Global Trading Ltd., and Deribit of Amsterdam. In 2015, the CFTC ordered bitcoin options trading platform Derivabit, which was based in California, to cease operations as it hadn’t followed regulatory procedures. This is another step in the crypto-currency community’s efforts for the sector to mature and draw in a broader user and investor base. Bitcoin had been under pressure as feuding factions disagreed on how to help the digital asset scale, until prices rebounded last week on signs an agreement is near. Chou said the ability to hedge digital assets will attract institutional investors who had been on the sidelines. “We’re getting people that want to hedge and people that want exposure to a new asset class that they can add to their portfolio and help diversify, and get potential upside of potential digital currency,” Chou said. “We want to keep it to a certain size in the beginning before we scale up over the next couple of months.” — With assistance by Benjamin Bain"

Sign up here to receive our newsletter. A recurring challenge for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is how to make them work in the real world. A Singapore-based startup says the answer is its Visa card. TenX is pitching its debit card as an instant converter of multiple digital currencies into fiat money: the dollars, yen and euros that power most everyday commerce. The company said it takes a 2 percent cut from each transaction and has received orders for more than 10,000 cards. While transactions are capped at $2,000 a year, users can apply to increase the limit if they undergo identify verification procedures.  Tenx’s bid to make digital currencies easier to spend comes amid massive volatility and infighting within the cryptocurrency community. Bitcoin, the most popular, slumped after reaching a record in June amid concerns about a split in two, only to recover as fears faded. The company has built an app that serves as a digital wallet connected to the Visa card so that when it’s swiped at a cafe or restaurant, the merchant is paid in local currency and the users’ crypto account is debited. “You’re mixing two worlds that are night and day,” co-founder Julian Hosp said in an interview. “When the user spends the cryptocurrency, we have to instantly switch these currencies to fiat and pay to Visa straight away. It’s a lot of pathways."" Hosp said transactions are processed immediately and it doesn’t impose any charges on top of the conversion fee that is set by cryptocurrency exchanges, which typically is 0.15 to 0.2 percent. The card now supports eight digital currencies, including the lesser-known dash and augur, and aims to offer about 11 of them by the end of the year. TenX currently processes about $100,000 of transactions a month. By the end of 2018, it’s targeting $100 million in monthly transactions and a million users.  TenX has an advantage in moving early, but the startup can expect competition in the future from major financial institutions and venture capitalists with deeper pockets and direct access to clients and databases, said Mati Greenspan, a Tel Aviv, Israel-based analyst at social trading platform eToro. “It’s an incredible concept,” said Greenspan. “At the end of the day, it’s going to depend a lot on customer relations. Are they meeting the customers’ expectations? Can somebody else do it better?” TenX’s efforts to make digital currencies spendable come as it joined the many blockchain-based startups taking advantage of initial coin offerings. ICOs are a cross between crowdfunding and an initial public offering that firms use to raise funds by issuing digital tokens rather than stock. In its token sale last month, TenX raised $80 million with about half to be used to expand operations while the rest will provide liquidity for a cryptocurrency exchange in the works, said Hosp. The company had previously raised $120,000 from angel investors and $1 million in a seed round led by venture capital firm Fenbushi Capital, which lists Ethereum’s co-founder, Vitalik Buterin, as a general partner. TenX isn’t expecting to become profitable in the next two years as it focuses on expanding services. “One thing we want to offer in the end, is that you can switch cryptocurrencies within the app,” said Hosp. “If we do this, we can become the market maker, which can bring in a lot of revenue.”"

Let's be honest, semiconductors used to be boring. The Traitorous Eight? Actually a bunch of badly dressed men in oversized suits. And nobody is telling their grandchildren about the great Integrated Circuit Patent Wars of the 1960s. But now the chips business is pretty cool. It's taken the same trajectory as tech geeks who graduated overnight from college dorm obscurity to the billionaire limelight. The leap is arguably down to the ubiquity of smartphones, but autonomous cars, artificial intelligence and cloud computing are all adding lustre to the industry. At least in the U.S. In Europe, the semiconductor business is still overlooked, compared with their U.S. and Asian rivals. Which I find odd, because it's full of interesting companies. Really. Look at ARM Holdings, one of the most important firms in terms of smartphone development, which went out of its way to be boring before someone with a $93 billion vision turned up. And take ASML —it’s a $66 billion Dutch company that makes semiconductor manufacturing equipment the size of buses. They are selling a lot of them. Or AMS, the Austrian sensor company based in a medieval château. Or how about ASM International, another semiconductor-equipment maker from the Netherlands that's currently battling an activist? ARM, ASML, AMS, ASMI. Ok, maybe you've spotted the problem. It's not that they are dull companies; it's that they've got boring names that start with the letter 'A'. Personally, I can't decide whether this is one of the reasons why European tech doesn't get enough attention; we're just terrible at names. Look at what happens when a manufacturer does have an interesting name. NXP, based in Eindhoven, is the biggest supplier of chips to the automotive industry. It used to be called Philips Semiconductors. Boring. Then just over 10 years ago it threw an X in its name, then floated, and is now getting bought by a U.S. company (beginning with the letter Q) for at least $47 billion.  In short, European semiconductor executives need to be more imaginative with their company names if they want to grab headlines. Like Scrabble™,  adding Q, Z and other high-value letters might be a winning strategy. These names starting with A are never going to score big. Which is a shame because, wordplay aside, Europe is selling chips at a faster rate than any other region.  Sign up to receive the Fully Charged newsletter in your inbox, and follow Bloomberg Technology on Twitter and Facebook for more. Grab the popcorn. The debate over the dangers of artificial intelligence has ensnared Elon Musk and Mark Zuckerberg, with the two tech icons trading barbs in public.

Meg Whitman for Uber CEO?

The company, which is seeking a new leader after Travis Kalanick stepped down amid scandals, may announce a decision within six weeks, the people said.  Bankers are ditching their jobs and jumping into the murky world of initial coin offerings. Financiers from Hong Kong and Beijing to London are abandoning lucrative careers to plunge into ICOs, or the sale of virtual coins mostly based on the ethereum blockchain, similar to the technology that underpins bitcoin.  SoftBank has set its sights on iRobot. The Japanese company has built a less than 5 percent stake in the maker of autonomous vacuum cleaners, which has a market value of $2.4 billion. SoftBank has been building its holdings in robotics firms, including the acquisition of Boston Dynamics last month. "

Work and discussion around ‘scaling bitcoin’ has been ongoing for years -– with the first dedicated conference around the topic beginning in 2015."" “After BIP91 locks in, approximately two weeks later SegWit should go live.

That’s just $6.1 billion shy of the annual record set in 2015, shortly after companies like LendingClub Corp. and On Deck Capital Inc. went public. In the second quarter of this year alone, more than $5 billion was raised, the report showed. Even as some startups in other sectors of the private market have faced scandals (Uber Technologies Inc.) or had initial public offerings that flopped (Blue Apron Holdings Inc, Snap Inc. ), some recent financing rounds in fintech were large enough to mint new unicorns. In the past three months, five new startups with valuations over $1 billion were born: Clover Health, Robinhood Financial LLC, Avidxchange Inc., Symphony and Tuandaiwang, according to CB Insights. Venture Capital firms including 500 Startups and New Enterprise Associates have been the most active in the past five quarters, but funding wouldn’t be hitting records without the help of corporate investors. In fact, corporate participation hit a five-quarter high for fintech in the second quarter, with these firms participating in more than 30 percent of deals globally.

Sign up here to receive our newsletter. U.S. regulators said they have jurisdiction over one of the hottest new areas of finance: initial coin offerings of digital currencies. Companies that raise money through the sale of digital assets must adhere to federal securities laws, the Securities and Exchange Commission said Tuesday. Issuers must register the deals with the government unless they have a valid excuse, as should exchanges that offer trading of cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether, the regulator said. “It’s been a long time coming and this is a big deal,” said Angela Walch, associate professor at St. Mary’s University School of Law. “People have been waiting for some kind of signal from regulators on ICOs.” This is the most detailed the SEC has been about how digital currencies and the exchanges where they trade fit into financial markets, she said. “It’s a reminder that basic consumer protection principles still apply” in the digital asset world, she added. “The tech people coming in don’t necessarily realize they’re playing with fire.” Startups have raised hundreds of millions of dollars selling such tokens in 2017, bypassing traditional initial public offerings of shares -- a process overseen by the SEC -- in favor of so-far mostly unregulated ICOs. The commission examined the sale of tokens to fund a startup known as the DAO last year, which raised about $150 million over four weeks, according to the SEC’s investigative report released Tuesday. Read More: Digital Coins Are So Hot, Startups Are Selling Them Like an IPO The agency’s enforcement division was asked to decide if the DAO token sales “violated federal securities laws with unregistered offers and sales of DAO Tokens in exchange for ‘Ether,’ a virtual currency,” the report said. The SEC decided not to bring charges in the DAO token sale case. Instead, the SEC report said it wanted “to caution the industry and market participants: the federal securities laws apply to those who offer and sell securities in the United States, regardless whether the issuing entity is a traditional company or a decentralized autonomous organization, regardless whether those securities are purchased using U.S. dollars or virtual currencies, and regardless whether they are distributed in certificated form or through distributed ledger technology.” One recent ICO was led by Gnosis, a prediction market application based on the Ethereum blockchain. It raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market value of almost $300 million. It’s generated no revenue and has little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Yet its tokens, which would allow users to bet on things such as election outcomes, have soared 200 percent since early May, according to Coinmarketcap.com. An open question is whether the SEC will apply these new standards to coin offerings that have already happened, said Walch, who is also a research fellow at the Centre for Blockchain Technologies at University College London. And while the SEC won’t pursue action related to the DAO token sale, “I don’t see anything in here that says there won’t be enforcement actions against others,” she said. Some recent ICO have been “egregious,” she said. “I’d be very surprised if they were willing to shove them all under the rug.”The SEC decision comes a day after the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission gave LedgerX LLC approval to offer options trading based on bitcoin. That could help mature the business of bitcoin trading by helping traders offset risks with derivatives. But it also underscored the fact that digital currencies, decentralized technologies that appeal to the libertarian-minded, probably cannot escape governments. ICOs offer an attractive deal to young companies: going directly to customers for funding, avoiding venture-capital firms and other professionals. SEC Chairman Jay Clayton addressed the balance he’s trying to strike, saying in the regulator’s statement that, “We seek to foster innovative and beneficial ways to raise capital, while ensuring -- first and foremost -- that investors and our markets are protected.” “What the SEC did not say is that all tokens are securities. Rather, they suggest a facts-and-circumstances test,” Peter Van Valkenburgh, research director at Coin Center, said in an email. “We believe that applying the same facts-and-circumstances test to other tokens will mean that some do not fit into the definition of securities, particularly tokens with an underlying utility rather than a mere speculative investment value.” Markets such as Coinbase Inc.’s GDAX and Gemini Trust Co. that offer trading in digital assets so far have dealt mostly with state, not federal, regulators. The SEC now says that will likely change. “Additionally, securities exchanges providing for trading in these securities must register unless they are exempt,” the agency said. Calling that a “big deal,” Walch said, “Those in the crypto world have been acting as if they live in an alternate universe, and the SEC has delivered a reminder that they still live in the real world, with real investors and real people making decisions that they must be accountable for.”"

         & Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-25/bankers-ditch-fat-salaries-to-chase-digital-currency-riches,"Richard Liu gave up a seven-figure salary this month to get into one of the hottest financial instruments around right now: initial coin offerings. The former China Renaissance deal-maker has since backed a clutch of cryptocoin sales that’ve raised millions -- sometimes in seconds -- often without a single product. From Hong Kong and Beijing to London, accomplished financiers are abandoning lucrative careers to plunge into the murky world of ICOs, a way to amass quick money by selling digital tokens to investors sans banks or regulators. Cut out of the action, a growing cohort of banking professionals are instead applying their talents toward buying or hawking cryptocurrency. They’re going in with eyes wide open. For Liu, who put together some of China’s biggest tech deals in his old job, the chance to shape the nascent arena outweighs the dangers of a market crash or crackdown. Loosely akin to IPOs, ICOs have raised millions from investors hoping to get in early on the next bitcoin or ether, and their unchecked growth over the past year is such that they’ve drawn comparisons to the first ill-fated dot-com boom. Yet with stratospheric bonuses largely a thing of the past, the allure of an incandescent new arena far from financial red-tape has proven irresistible to some. “Traditional investment banks and VCs need to monitor this space closely, it could become very big,” said the 30-year-old partner at $50 million hedge fund FBG Capital, which has backed about 20 ICOs. He’s off to a quick start, getting in on this year’s largest sale: Tezos, a smart contracts platform that raised $200 million to outstrip the average Hong Kong IPO size this year of around $31 million. “Unlike the traditional financial sector, there are no ceilings or barriers. There’s so much to imagine,” he said. Critics say many ICOs are built on little more than hyperactive imaginations. A cross between crowdfunding and an initial public offering, they involve the sale of virtual coins mostly based on the ethereum blockchain, similar to the technology that underpins bitcoin. But unlike a traditional IPO in which buyers get shares, getting behind a startup’s ICO nets you virtual tokens -- like mini-cryptocurrencies -- unique to the issuing company or its network. That means they grow in value only if the startup’s business or network proves viable, attracting more people and boosting liquidity. That’s a big if, and the sheer profusion of untested concepts has spurred talk of a bubble. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission signaled greater scrutiny of the red-hot sector when it warned on Tuesday that ICOs may be considered securities, though it stopped short of suggesting a broader clampdown. The regulator however did reaffirm its focus on protecting investors: part of the appeal of ICOs lies in the fact that -- for now -- anyone with a bold idea can raise money from anybody.  At least 90 ICOs have taken place this year, raising more than $1 billion based on proposals from free wi-fi sharing to trading software without a single line of code. It’s already exceeded early-stage venture capital financing. With little more than an explanation of the ad-lite browser it envisioned, Brendan Eich’s Brave Software scored $35 million for its Basic Attention Token sale in under a minute in May. “These ICOs are not selling shares, which means their investors will have to count on the promise and reliability of the founders,” said Beijing-based Chandler Guo, a bitcoin miner and angel investor who’s helped more than 20 ICOs list on cryptocurrency exchanges. So “I don’t invest in any projects unless I know where they live and their mother lives.” Justin Short, who created electronic trading algorithms for Bank of America Corp. before launching trading-related startup Nous, is preparing to launch his own sale of digital tokens to bankroll what he calls cryptoasset portfolio management. A former Wall Street floor trader, he likens the advent of ICOs to an episode half a billion years ago when many of the planet’s life forms came into existence. “It’s a Cambrian explosion of ideas. But that means you have to put in your work to figure out which one is even likely to work,” he said. Cryptocoins bypass middlemen such as fee-absorbing banks and venture capital firms, and offer access to fast money. But that also means traditional checks and balances are absent. The key may be to recognize which tokens serve an essential purpose to the selling startup’s network, and thus will appreciate in value alongside rising adoption. Former HSBC forex-trading architect Hugh Madden, currently Chief Technology Officer of Hong Kong-based ANX International, this month helped raise about $18.7 million for cryptocurrency exchange OAX. He likens ICO-token ownership to a football club membership. You don’t get special access but as the team gets better, more people become fans and the price goes up. When a football club “builds more relationships with other clubs, gets more matches, and generally enjoys wider adoption, then more people want to be a part of it,” the 40-year-old said. “There is no limit to participants, but there is a limit to memberships that allow members to exert influence on the future direction of the club.” With ICOs however, the true price of membership can be impossible to gauge. Prominent bitcoin developers including Peter Todd have pointed to coding flaws in projects. Trading platform CoinDash said hackers made off with $7 million during its ICO just this month. Hackers made off with nearly $40 million last week, stealing ICO funds from CoinDash, Swarm City, æternity, and others. And a significant number of ICOs have been underpinned by mere protocols -- operational frameworks with standard processes minus a business model. “It’s very hard to value a protocol,” said Gavin Yeung, a former Hong Kong-based trader at Deutsche Bank AG who’s weighing an ICO for his cryptocurrency index trading platform Cryptomover. “The protocol only becomes valuable if the number of users increase exponentially on the network, so unless these protocols have substantial users or awareness, these projects could end up with zero value.” The rush of speculators and get-rich-quick schemes in the space has both Yeung and Madden expecting more regulatory scrutiny. But the challenge is ICOs aren’t confined by geography. For example, OAX’s token attracted 4,400 backers across a dozen jurisdictions from China to Russia and the U.S. “It’s very hard for regulators to have an isolated policy response that’s happening on a global cross-border basis,” Madden said. Interest in ICOs remains sky-high. Ron Chernesky started his career as a trader on Wall Street 10 years ago, first on a trading floor and then running trading platform InvestFeed Inc. He’s now in the process of replacing U.S. equities trading on his platform with digital currency trading, and planned to conduct his own ICO to raise 28,000 ether -- worth roughly $6 million at current prices. “We’re completely ditching the model that we’ve been doing for the past three years and now we’re looking at cryptocurrency,” the 38-year-old said. “This is long term for us, we see this as the new gateway to the millennial way of investing and where everything is going from here.” Perhaps. Liu, the ex-China Renaissance executive, compares the ICO market to the first internet boom and bust, when startups from Webvan to Pets.com imploded and investors’ money went up in smoke. Yet it’s in part the opportunity to carve out a niche away from monolithic banking bureaucracy that’s lured him to this space. “You want to be on a rocket ship,” Liu said. “If you join early, then every day you’re making history.” — With assistance by Yuji Nakamura"

         & Lulu Yilun Chen
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-21/bitcoin-community-cheers-as-miners-back-new-scaling-framework,"Bitcoin backers celebrated as the developer community embraced a new mechanism to improve usage and allow it to scale, boosting confidence in the virtual currency and sending prices back near record highs. The community, which had been split on how best to make the cryptocurrency more manageable, rallied behind a code upgrade known as SegWit2x, which aims to increase the network’s transaction capacity. That fueled a rally on in bitcoin’s price against the dollar, which had plummeted from a peak in June as concerns grew about its future in what has been called a civil war. “We’re thrilled to get past this impasse,” said Andrew Lee, head of bitcoin-shopping startup purse.io, whose team celebrated with beers at their San Francisco office. The development opens “the doors to much-awaited innovations,” he said. Bitcoin enthusiasts in New York and San Francisco, to Hong Kong and Tokyo, gathered in bars and offices to hold impromptu parties, while others took to Twitter and social media to cheer the move, as well as the price rally. The impasse arose from a limit placed on the size of blocks underpinning the network in bitcoin’s early days, in order to prevent hacker attacks. As the virtual currency grew in popularity over the past nine years, transaction times and processing fees soared, curtailing the community’s ability to process payments with the same efficiency as services like Visa Inc. Miners and developers were locked in a heated debate for years on how best to upgrade the software, culminating in the recent clash. More than 93 percent of miners who function as the backbone of the digital tokens network locked in support for BIP91, the first necessary step in implementing SegWit2x, according to Coin Dance, a website tracking adoption. Bitcoin’s miners are independent groups that verify and process bitcoin’s transactions by solving complex computational problems, in order to be rewarded by fees and creation of the digital currency. Read more on the bitcoin civil war. SegWit2x is essentially a compromise between two main competing camps. One proposed a direct approach, seeking to increase the block size. The other, a group of developers known collectively as Core, pushed for a long-term solution by moving some data outside of the main network, a scheme called SegWit that had been resisted by miners because it also could diminish their influence. In the end, the miners agreed to adopt SegWit, but also increase the block size to 2 megabytes. The upgrade isn’t final. The BIP91 lock-in has a grace period of about two days, during which miners will prepare to activate the software. It will then take about two weeks for SegWit to be fully adopted. Developers still warn about potential hacker attacks that could disrupt the process. Then, three months from now, the community will face another challenge when some of the world’s biggest miners move to adopt the second phase of the proposal, the doubling of the blocksize. Still, many in the community agrees that the hard part is over, with prices seen stabilizing and strengthening. “We do believe it will continue, now that we’ve gotten over this hump,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head trader at digital-trading company Octagon Strategy in Hong Kong. — With assistance by Justina Lee"

To be among the first to get it, sign up here.Banks are distancing themselves from one of China’s most acquisitive companies. Several of the Chinese firms that funded HNA Group's $40 billion acquisition spree are halting new loans, according to people familiar with the matter. HNA took on at least $73 billion of debt as it transformed from an obscure regional airline into a worldwide conglomerate with multi-billion dollar stakes in Hilton and Deutsche Bank. A dearth of fresh credit could further restrain the company’s ambitions as Chinese regulators clamp down on the offshore deals to stem capital outflows and shore up the yuan. Lenders in China aren’t the only ones distancing themselves from HNA. Bank of America Corp. has told investment bankers to stop working on transactions with the company for now amid growing concerns about the group’s debt levels and ownership structure. Stock's 500% surge hasn't changed this bear's mind. Robin Zhu's got a strong stomach when it comes to being bearish on Geely Automobile Holdings. Since August 2015 he's been advising investors to avoid the company, during which time the share price has soared more than 500 percent. And he's not backing down. Despite the company being the world's best-performing auto stock this year, Zhu sees a 57 percent stock drop in the next 12 months. Grab raises $2 billion in Southeast Asia's largest venture fundraising. The money, from Didi Chuxing and SoftBank Group, allows Grab to join forces with the two companies in an effort to drive Uber Technologies out of China. The Singapore-based ride-hailing company said Monday it expects to close another $500 million from unspecified new and existing backers. That would take its valuation north of $6 billion, a person familiar with the matter said. Elderly drivers are wreaking havoc on Japan's roads. As Japan’s population continues to age — meaning more and more older drivers are behind the wheel — an accident problem is getting worse: Drivers aged 75 and over were connected to 459 fatal accidents last year, 13 percent of Japan’s total, up from 7.4 percent a decade earlier, National Police Agency data show. This startup is taking bitcoin into the real world. A recurring challenge for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is how to make them work in the real world. A Singapore-based startup says the answer is its Visa card. TenX is pitching its debit card as an instant converter of multiple digital currencies into fiat money: the dollars, yen and euros that power most everyday commerce. Chinese investor snaps up Bordeaux wine estate Chateau Fauchey. The estate, sold for an undisclosed sum, comprises the 15th century chateau along with 25 hectares (62 acres) of land. Investors from China have bought more than 100 Bordeaux wine estates since starting to focus on the area in 2010, seeking both access to supplies of wine for the growing Chinese domestic market and also historic properties which can be used to expand wine tourism. Cash handouts for farmers as Najib battles for votes.  Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak raised the stakes in his efforts to secure the votes of palm oil farmers, announcing hundreds of millions of dollars in aid ahead of an election that could come within months. Najib needs those farming votes if his coalition is to extend its 60-year grip on power. Tokyo tries to work from home to ease congestion. With 920,000 spectators expected to visit Japan's capital each day of the 2020 Olympic Games, Tokyo is facing a huge logistical challenge — how to get everyone in and out of the city center. One method, that was trialed today for the first time, is to ask commuters to work from home. Some 750 companies and organizations were expected to take part. The government hopes ""Telework Day"" will prove so successful that it leads to more flexible work practices. "
2017-07-24T20:30:13.752Z,The Daily Prophet: It's Make or Break Time for U.S. Stock Market,"Robert Burgess
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-24/the-daily-prophet-it-s-make-or-break-time-for-u-s-stock-market-j5ilwn38,"Perhaps the biggest head-scratcher in all markets is how U.S. equities are able to continually reach new heights in the face of slower economic growth and the turmoil in Washington while supporting sky-high valuations. The short answer has been the expectation for strong profits growth. The bulls are about to find out whether that optimism is justified.    Earnings season is now in full swing with almost 20 percent of the Standard & Poor's 500 Index's members reporting this week, including market leaders Amazon.com and Facebook. With President Donald Trump's pro-growth fiscal agenda seemingly sidelined for the time being, there's not much for bulls to hang on to other than the prospect for decent earnings. Those that disappoint have been swiftly punished by investors, as General Electric Co. found out on Friday. Signs of fading investor enthusiasm abound. Consider the SPDR S&P 500 Trust, the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking the benchmark. Investors pulled $3.8 billion out of it in July through Thursday, according to Bloomberg News' Oliver Renick. That puts the fund on pace for a fourth consecutive monthly outflow, which would be the longest streak since the start of the bull rally in 2009. But what if the market is operating under a new paradigm when it comes to valuations and maybe this earnings season isn't so crucial? That's a question posed by Leuthold Weeden Capital Management Chief Investment Strategist Jim Paulsen. He notes that in the last quarter-century, the market's price-to-earnings ratio has averaged more than 25, or about two-thirds higher than its average between 1880 and 1990. Here's Paulsen in his own words: ""The U.S. economy -- and thus earnings flows --  has become far less cyclical, recession risk has diminished markedly, inflation has been far more stable, the composition of the U.S. stock market has become much more growth-oriented, participation in the stock market has broadened significantly, less valuation-focused index funds have gained considerable popularity, and finally, the world has enjoyed a massive technological advance and witnessed a ballooning of functioning capitalistic economies in all corners of the globe.''  WHAT ABOUT THE DOLLAR AND U.S. BONDS?Both are suggesting a much different outlook than equities, at least in the short term. Commodities Futures Trading Commission data show that bets against the dollar are at their highest since early 2013, while bullish wagers on the 30-year Treasury bond are about the highest since mid-2016, according to Bloomberg News' Liz McCormick. One wouldn't expect to see such extreme positioning if investors were confident in the outlook for the economy and the prospect for much higher interest rates. It's even more remarkable given that Federal Reserve policy makers will wrap up a two-day meeting on Wednesday. The expectation is that they will keep their outlook for gradual rate increases, but the positioning suggests that the potential for a surprise could cause big moves in the dollar and in bonds. Nervous currency traders are paying the most in eight years for insurance against a plunge in the dollar against the euro, according to Bloomberg News' Lananh Nguyen and Robert Fullem. The Fed will likely be as ""vague and flexible as possible"" because ""if they catch the market on the wrong foot, we’d have some pretty big moves,"" Max Kettner, a cross-asset strategist at Commerzbank, said on Bloomberg radio.  CANADA IS HAVING A MOMENTPrime Minister Justin Trudeau must be doing something right. The International Monetary Fund said in the quarterly update to its World Economic Outlook that Canada will lead the Group of Seven countries in economic growth this year, expanding at a 2.5 percent clip, up from 1.9 percent in its April forecast. As if on cue, government data Monday showed that wholesale sales rose in May by more than forecast, adding to higher-than-forecast growth in retail and manufacturing sales, as well as a surge in new jobs that capped the best quarter since 2010, according to Bloomberg News' Maciej Onoszko. The country's economic strength can be seen in its resurgent currency. The loonie, as it's known, strengthened to 80 U.S. cents on Monday for the first time in more than a year. Hedge funds and other speculators flipped their wagers on the loonie to net long less than two months after amassing record short positions against the currency, according to Commodity Futures Trading Commission data released July 21. Now, if only the stock market would cooperate. S&P/TSX Composite Index is one of the world's worst performers this year, falling about 1 percent, as oil and energy decline. SORRY BOND TRADERS, GREECE IS BACKHere's something that many bond investors probably never thought -- or hoped -- they'd see in their lifetimes: Greece tapping the debt markets for new financing. The country, which was the epicenter of the European sovereign crisis that began in 2009, is looking to sell five-year bonds, according to an Athens Stock Exchange filing. With the sale, the government of Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is seeking to chalk out a path for an exit from the current bailout program, which ends in August 2018, while also capping the country’s financing needs in 2019 -- expected to be about 19 billion euros ($22.1 billion), according to Bloomberg News' Sotiris Nikas and Lyubov Pronina. The IMF agreed to a new $1.8 billion conditional loan for Greece on Thursday, with disbursement contingent on euro-zone countries providing debt relief. A day later, S&P Global Ratings raised the country’s sovereign credit-rating outlook to ""positive"" and affirmed the long-term foreign currency debt rating at B-, or six levels below investment grade. CHEAP MEAT ON THE WAYCattle prices plunged the most in nine months after a government report showed that the outlook for U.S. red-meat supplies looks more abundant. The number of cattle moved into feedlots in June was the highest for the month since 2006, as rising profits and drought across the northern Great Plains pushed more animals off pastures. According to Bloomberg News' Jeff Wilson. Placements rose 16 percent from a year earlier, topping the 6.8 percent increase expected by analysts surveyed by Bloomberg. June marked the fourth straight month that cattle placements rose by more than 11 percent. Feedlot operators typically buy year-old cattle called feeders that weigh about 500 pounds (227 kilograms) to 800 pounds. The animals are fattened on corn until they are about 1,300 pounds, then sold to meatpackers. “The market was clearly surprised by the sheer size of the increase,” said Steve Wagner, market analyst at CHS Hedging. On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures for delivery in October plunged by the 3-cent limit, or 2.6 percent, to $1.144 a pound. A close at that price would be the biggest loss for the contract since Sept. 30. TEA LEAVESThe IMF just cut its 2017 economic growth forecast for the U.S. to 2.1 percent from the 2.3 percent it estimated in April. But if you need more evidence that confidence in a strong second-half rebound in the economy is waning, keep a close eye on the Treasury Department's auction Tuesday of $26 billion of notes due in two years. That's because those securities are generally more sensitive to changes in Federal Reserve policy than longer maturity debt. What's notable is that the amount of bids relative to the amount offered rose at the each of the government's last three auctions of two-year notes, with the so-called bid-to-cover ratio reaching a 2-month high of 3.03 at the sale a month ago. So, one conclusion is that bond investors are not worried about a sustained pace of Fed rate hikes in response to stronger growth if they are scooping up short-term debt so readily. Former Fed Governor Daniel Tarullo said  on Bloomberg Television that weak inflation could weigh on the central bank's discussions about whether to raise rates, with only little risk that prices will surge out of control.  If you’d like to get The Daily Prophet in e-mail form, right in your inbox, please subscribe to this link.

2017-07-25T13:37:06.772Z,Mr. Fun and Poison Short-Sellers,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-25/mr-fun-and-poison-short-sellers,"Mr. Fun. We have talked a couple of times before about how John Cryan, the chief executive officer of Deutsche Bank AG, is no fun: He has ""the pale skin of a workaholic and a frequent flyer,"" a loathing of childhood, a penchant for memorizing Latin tree names, and a nickname among his colleagues of ""Mr. Grumpy."" But that's all changed now! It is all relative I guess, but you'd probably rather talk about client business than endless litigation too. Cryan has led Deutsche Bank in raising capital and ""strengthening its legal controls, rewiring its information technology systems, taming its trading culture, and rebalancing its customer base, all while trying to boost sales from a shrinking enterprise."" The bank has also launched ""a renewed commitment to Germany"" -- ""you've got to have your roots in good old Germany,"" says Supervisory Board Chairman Paul Achleitner -- that it calls Project Oaktree, though presumably Cryan wanted to call it Project Quercus robur. The gist of Cryan's reforms for Deutsche Bank are that he wants to move it away from being a trading powerhouse -- a ""flow monster"" -- and back to more of a traditional corporate and investment bank.  There are various flavors of skepticism about this -- Is it the right plan? Will they be able to implement it? -- but one leading complaint is that it is the right plan but too late: If your view is that the post-crisis change in the banking industry is permanent, that the next 100 years of banking will be about a boring decline of trading businesses, then they have lost some time, but they're a big bank, and 100 years is a long time, and eventually Deutsche Bank will be attuned to the new world. If your view is that the change is cyclical -- that regulations are already being rolled back, animal spirits are already being unleashed, and the groundwork is already being laid for the return of profitable and aggressive trading businesses -- then Deutsche Bank's long period of uncertainty might have left it well positioned to be more flexible than its rivals. Or it might have left it out of sync with the cycle: Maybe Deutsche Bank will complete its pivot to sleepy regional banking just in time to miss out on all the benefits of being a flow monster. Poison short sellers? My Fifth Law of Insider Trading, which is of course not legal advice, is that you should not insider trade by planting bombs at a company and shorting its stock. Several people have criticized this law by saying ""well that's not really insider trading, that's a different sort of illegal stock manipulation,"" but I do not want to hear it; it is insider trading enough for me. Anyway the Fifth Law is meant to be illustrative, and it applies to sabotage-based trading that goes beyond literal bombs. For example, Law 5B of Insider Trading would be, don't short a restaurant company's stock and then poison its food: Those things are basically that ... Chipotle had a lot of food-poisoning outbreaks? Chipotle ""did not see any evidence to support"" this theory, and I am not especially convinced. Still, I hope it is true. I hope some hedge fund with a big short position on Chipotle Mexican Grill is sending out analysts to sneeze on the food when no one's looking. Short sellers get a bad rap as ""icky and un-American,"" always trying to bring down successful companies, but perhaps it is surprising that there are so few stories like this, of Fifth Law violations in which short sellers actually sabotage their targets. Muddy Waters claimed that St. Jude Medical devices could be hacked and lead to patient deaths, but it never went out and killed patients to prove its point. With enough money on the line, you might expect more short sellers to resort to sabotage, but it still seems vanishingly rare. Is CDS bad? Here is a story about how credit default swaps sometimes don't work quite as intended: They may not pay out 100 cents on the dollar on Banco Popular Espanol SA's defaulted capital instruments because those instruments may still have legal claims available, or contracts on Matalan may be left ""orphaned"" if CDS sellers recapitalize the company. This is all broadly correct: CDS is not simply a bet on whether an issuer will or won't default; it is a specific derivative contract with a specific set of provisions, and much of the joy in its use is in figuring out how to make money by reading those provisions more cleverly than everyone else does. I think that is rather lovely but others disagree: Look. There is already a great product for real-money investors. It is called ""bonds."" If you are a real-money investor, you can take your real money use it to buy bonds -- actual investments of actual money in actual companies -- rather than CDS, a purely synthetic derivative product. Similarly, if you are a real-money investor who owns some bonds of a company, and you want to hedge your exposure, you can just sell some of the bonds.  I like that CDS is weird. It teaches a useful lesson, that getting a thematic call right, or predicting which companies will or won't default, isn't enough. You still have to read the documents, and think about corner cases, and be prepared for surprises. Bonds, after all, are complicated. Defaults are complicated. It is tempting to think that CDS should be easy, and should abstract away from those complexities by being binary contracts that pay out at 100 cents on the dollar on any default: But then it wouldn't be a good hedge for actual bonds, would it? After all, bonds can default and have a higher-than-zero recovery; you want your CDS prices to reflect the actual risk in bonds, not just an isolated probability of default. CDS suits loads of different people because it is complicated, because it tries -- imperfectly -- to mirror the complication of the rest of the world. Market structure. NYSE Group Inc. opened its new ""NYSE American"" exchange on Monday, which copies IEX Group Inc.'s use of a 350-microsecond ""speed bump"" to protect dark orders from crumbling prices: Look, you can't really criticize them too much for that. Presumably NYSE genuinely believed that intentional delays should be illegal, but once the Securities and Exchange Commission decided that they were legal, then NYSE is as free to use them as anyone else. If IEX is making money by doing something that NYSE thinks is bad, then NYSE's first choice was to try to stop it, but when that failed the perfectly reasonable second choice was to jump in and try to take some of that money for itself. They are running a business here. Still I would like it a lot more if they had just named the new exchange ""NYSE Cynical."" It's not like anyone is routing orders to NYSE American because they get a warm patriotic glow from the name.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Oh come on, the Financial Times's Alphaville blog beat me to doing an initial coin offering. Theirs is called Alphachain, and here is the obligatory short and nonsensical white paper, which starts with a quote from Wittgenstein. (The ICO blog post starts with a quote from me.) I feel that it is very unfair that they will be raising money to ""retire young(ish)"" with this ICO, and I won't, simply because they got their act together to actually do one while I have just been making dumb jokes about it here. Not that theirs is much more than some dumb jokes about doing an ICO, but it is more in one critical respect, which is that they include bitcoin and ether addresses to which you can send your money. I have not yet gotten around to doing that. You could just Venmo me I guess? Anyway in the future everyone will have their own parody cryptocurrency. I should do an ICO for a token that lets you set up your own parody cryptocurrency, though technically that is ether. Elsewhere, ""Bitcoin Options Exchange Wins Approval From CFTC."" And, sure, a bitcoin debit card: And: ""Avoiding blockchain for blockchain’s sake: Three real use case criteria.""  People are worried about the debt ceiling. ""Wall Street Braces for Debt-Ceiling Showdown,"" reads this perennially recurring headline, though this one is from yesterday. And: ""Investors Shy Away From T-Bill Auction With Debt Ceiling Looming."" One thing that I sometimes think about all these ""People are worried about ____"" sections is that you shouldn't worry too much about them: Once something gets enough media worrying to become a recurring Money Stuff section, that means that we're prepared for it; the real crisis will be caused by something that we weren't all worrying about. But that is a very efficient-markets view of worry, and I am not sure that it applies to manufactured political crises. The debt ceiling is a purely elective crisis: Congress could just decide not to have a crisis, and we wouldn't have a crisis. There are no tradeoffs or hard compromises or tricky issues to solve; Congress is just handed the question ""would you like the U.S. to default on its debt, or not?"" How confident can you be that it will continue to choose ""not""? People are worried that people aren't worried enough. If you think that people aren't worried enough, why not put some money on that position? Here's someone who did: There is a payout graph. The trader loses with a VIX below 12 or above about 35, and you'd hate to bet that people aren't worried enough, turn out to be right, and then lose money anyway because people ended up even more worried than you'd thought they'd be. People are worried about unicorns. We talk sometimes around here about the theory that common ownership of multiple public companies in the same industry by the same group of large institutional shareholders -- often index funds and quasi-indexers -- might reduce competition in that industry. The weirdest laboratory for that theory, though, may be the ride-sharing industry, which is dominated by large private companies, none of which are owned by index funds, but all of which seem to have a lot of cross-ownership.  The latest is that SoftBank Group Corp., which already owns stakes in Didi Chuxing and other ride-sharing companies, and which was once described as ""the biggest challenger to Uber,"" has approached Uber Technologies Inc. ""about taking a multibillion-dollar stake in the San Francisco company."" ""SoftBank’s talks with Uber are described as preliminary and one-sided,"" which is an unusual way to describe talks; presumably SoftBank called Uber's CEO and the call went to voicemail until Uber actually appoints one. ""We're a little busy here guys,"" Uber could reasonably have replied. But a big SoftBank/Uber stake would further cement the ride-sharing business as a sort of global keiretsu in which everyone owns a little bit of everyone else. Why swoop in and undercut your competitor when your shareholders are also its shareholders, and also you are its shareholder, and also it is your shareholder?  Also: What price would they pay? Uber's most recent valuation in a fundraising round was something like $68 billion, but since then Uber has had some unpleasantness, and lost its CEO, and apparently traded down in the secondary market. An approach from SoftBank to do a large down-round financing wouldn't sound all that attractive; an approach to do a financing at a premium to Uber's last round would be ... rather generous on SoftBank's part? This is never really an issue with public companies: If they want to raise money, they raise it around where their stock is currently trading, without wasting too much time on nostalgia over where their stock was trading two years ago. With tech unicorns, though, that nostalgia can be paralyzing. People are worried about bond market liquidity. Good news for bond market liquidity: Tradeweb Markets LLC's electronic bond trading platform now handles about 1 percent of corporate volume. We talked last week about how the real liquidity providers in bond markets are value investors, not dealers: Dealers move bonds from one investor to another, but if a lot of investors are selling, there needs to be an ultimate buyer, and that's not going to be a dealer. It's going to be an investor (a fund or pension or insurance company) with long-term funding and appetite to buy beaten-down bonds. So in a world where dealers are retreating from making markets, why shouldn't investors step up to do it? And in fact they are: Things happen.

2017-07-24T10:21:49.829Z,Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day,"Lorcan Roche Kelly
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-24/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here It's PMI day, no change at OPEC meeting, and no end in sight to dollar bearishness. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. A composite Purchasing Managers’ Index for the euro area fell to 55.8 in July, the weakest pace in six months, according to IHS Markit. In France, the slowdown was concentrated in services as manufacturing grew at the fastest pace in six years. The IMF, meanwhile, has indicated that the world will rely less on the United States to drive global growth in the coming years, and cut its forecast for U.K. growth to 1.7 percent for this year while raising projections for Japan and the euro area.  At a meeting in Russia today, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies indicated they weren't planning any major changes to their deal to cut production. That means there will be no moves to impose output caps on Libya and Nigeria, countries that had been excused from the deal forged November 2016. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for September delivery was trading broadly unchanged at $45.80 at 5:25 a.m. Eastern Time.  Speculator and hedge-fund net short positioning on the dollar have risen to the highest number of contracts since 2013, according to the latest CFTC report. The currency slumped to a five-week low against the yen as concerns for President Donald Trump's growth agenda rise ahead of closed-door testimony from Jared Kushner to the Senate Intelligence Committee today. In other currency news, Poland's zloty strengthened the most in two months after the country's president unexpectedly vetoed part of the government's controversial judicial revamp.  Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed, while Japan's Topix index dropped 0.5 percent with exporters leading the losses due to the strong yen. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.5 percent lower at 5:45 a.m. with automakers among the worst performers as they come under scrutiny over possible collusion. U.S. market futures pointed to a lower open.  The big event for markets this week is Wednesday's Federal Reserve decision, with a Bloomberg survey showing that no change in policy is expected. Today in the U.S., preliminary Markit PMI data for July are released at 9:45 a.m., with existing home sales numbers at 10:00. Tech will dominate earnings this week, with Google parent Alphabet Inc. reporting after the bell today, while Amazon.com Inc. and Facebook Inc. are due in the coming days.  This is what's caught our eye over the last 24 hours."
2017-07-24T13:41:46.243Z,Lucky Investors and Venezuelan Bonds,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-24/lucky-investors-and-venezuelan-bonds,"Investing advice. This is the purest investing philosophy, from an Och-Ziff Capital Management Group investor about Och-Ziff's newish and well-paid co-chief investment officer, Jimmy Levin: Let's say you ran a fund-of-funds and built a perfectly rigorous set of tools to evaluate whether a manager's success is due to skill or luck. Let's say you determined with total certainty that Fund X's excellent returns are 100 percent due to luck. Would you invest? Conventional wisdom would say that you should only invest in a fund -- and, certainly, only pay high fees to that fund -- if its success is due to skill. Skill, the theory goes, is enduring and repeatable and worth paying for; luck is random and can change in an instant. But would you be a little tempted to be like ""well, better to be lucky than good, here's all my money""? There is a famous reductio ad absurdum in finance about how you shouldn't trust the winner of a coin-flipping contest to manage your money. But surely someone would! ""I do want to invest in lucky people,"" they'd say, ""and look at how confidently she flips that coin!"" Also Levin met Och-Ziff founder Dan Och ""when Levin was a counselor and water-skiing coach at a camp in Wisconsin where Och’s children spent part of their summer,"" which is an investing philosophy in itself. Do you think he planned that? Do you think that the investing clubs at Harvard and Wharton track where hedge fund managers send their kids to camp, and then get their members counselor jobs at those camps? If you want a hedge-fund job, is it better to spend a summer interning at Goldman Sachs, or teaching water-skiing to Dan Och's kids (or tennis to Bill Ackman)? Is meeting a famous hedge fund manager while teaching water-skiing at a camp in Wisconsin the sort of good luck that predicts more good luck in the future? Elsewhere, here are ""A Dozen Lessons on Investing from Ed Thorp,"" the legendary inventor of blackjack card-counting and the Black-Scholes theorem. Here he is on the Graham-Dodd/Warren Buffett approach to investing: The best advice in life is the kind that goes like ""if you do this, you can be rich, famous, successful and also lazy."" The ""work all the time until you die and you'll be a billionaire"" sort of advice is more of a mixed bag. A Venezuela theory. Most countries that default on their debt at least have the advantage that it's hard to foreclose on them. Usually when a country runs out of money and refuses to pay its creditors, the main penalty is that creditors don't lend it any more money. This is bad enough; after all, the country has run out of money and needs more. But usually the creditors can't seize the country's stuff, except in limited symbolic ways, like when Argentina absent-mindedly allowed a hedge fund to seize a navy ship. Venezuela, though, is different: It is a country with a hard-to-sustain debt load, but it has an oil company attached, one that sells a lot of oil in the U.S. Venezuela's state-owned oil company is called Petróleos de Venezuela SA, and it has a lot of debt outstanding, and people tend to think that PDVSA's debt is Venezuela's problem and Venezuela's debt is PDVSA's problem. So if either Venezuela or PDVSA restructures its debt, then it will need to deal with the risk that holdout creditors who refuse the restructuring might try to go after the streams of dollar payments that PDVSA/Venezuela get from selling oil into the U.S.  Here is a proposal from sovereign-debt restructuring experts Lee Buchheit and Mitu Gulati on ""How to Restructure Venezuelan Debt."" The modern way to restructure sovereign debt is to make sure that your bonds contain collective action clauses, in which holders of a supermajority of the bonds can vote to extend maturity or reduce interest or principal. The government negotiates with its main bondholders, and convinces them that restructuring the debt is the only way for them to get paid anything, and when they agree that binds everyone: Holdouts can't keep their bonds and demand more. Most of Venezuela's sovereign bonds do contain collective action clauses allowing a restructuring with a vote of 75 or 85 percent of the holders, though some do not, and even getting 75 or 85 percent of each series of bonds to agree to a restructuring might be challenging. (More modern collective action clauses aggregate voting across series, to prevent a hedge fund from blocking a restructuring by building up a 26 percent position in a single bond.) Buchheit and Gulati have some ideas for how Venezuela can improve its chances here, including their delightfully named ""cryonic solution"" that we have previously discussed. But the PDVSA bonds are harder, because they don't contain collective action clauses: PDVSA is a company, and its bonds look kind of like normal New York-law corporate bonds, and corporate bonds don't usually contain collective action clauses. (Because, for corporations, the rough equivalent of a collective action clause -- a restructuring binding on all creditors -- is bankruptcy, which is not so appealing for PDVSA/Venezuela.)  But there's a trick that might work. One clause in the PDVSA indenture (Section 10.02) allows PDVSA to ""delegate any of its obligations hereunder"" if it gets the approval of a majority of bondholders. Buchheit and Gulati propose that PDVSA could do an exit consent in which it offers consenting bondholders new exchange bonds (with longer maturities, lower rates, and perhaps lower principal) in exchange for (1) handing in their old bonds and (2) on the way out, voting to amend the old bonds to delegate PDVSA's payment obligations to a new company. Call it ""PDVSB."" (Oh, fine, they call it ""Newco."") This Newco would not have to be a particularly good company; in particular, Venezuela's oil revenue would not have to run through it. So you get your choice: Exchange into the new bonds, which have longer maturity and lower interest and maybe lower principal, but which are backed by Venezuela's oil revenues; or keep your old bonds, which have the same terms as before, but which are now backed by whatever Venezuela decides to put into Newco. And if Newco defaults, that's not PDVSA's, or Venezuela's, problem. This seems like cheating, but something like it was explicitly blessed by a U.S. appeals court in the recent Marblegate decision, which allowed a company to do a restructuring that left holdout bondholders with bonds in a more-or-less empty shell. (Buchheit and Gulati don't want to make Newco a purely empty shell, because that ""would be seen for what it is -- blatantly coercive and punitive -- and will inevitably end up in court,"" and propose instead ""to fund Newco with a percentage of its net revenues from the sale of oil during periods when the average price of Venezuelan oil exceeds a specified threshold,"" giving the Newco bonds some chance of being paid off if the price of oil recovers.) Will it work? I don't know. The world of sovereign bond restructuring is mostly not driven by general principles: It's not like there is agreement on the correct way to go about a negotiated restructuring, and a consensus that everyone will abide by the results. Instead it is a hodgepodge of idiosyncratic bond provisions, and of individual judges confronted with those provisions and tasked with interpreting them. Gulati told me by e-mail that he and Buchheit found their solution ""because I was teaching a class on How to Restructure Venezuelan Debt – and Lee had come down to talk to my students – and then we had drinks, and did what we do over drinks (sadly, reading indentures)."" That sounds idyllic, actually, and it's really the only way to do it. Elsewhere: ""‘They All Deserve to Die’: Caracas Militants Vow to Take Up Arms."" Oh London Whale. Bruno Iksil, the ""London Whale"" trader who left JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s chief investment office after losing several billion dollars on credit-index derivatives trades, has an incredible personal website with several rambling PDF documents explaining his version of what happened in his debacle, and who is to blame, and how he has been portrayed unfairly. ""Who could gobble such a gross bluff?,"" Iksil asks.  Bruno Iksil was also the star witness against Javier Martin-Artajo, his boss, and Julien Grout, his subordinate, in a U.S. criminal case charging them with covering up the London Whale losses by mis-marking the positions on JPMorgan's books. This was always a bit of a tough case: Iksil was the Whale, so if you are going to punish someone for the Whalery, he seems like a more sensible target than the guy he worked for and the guy who worked for him. (Also Martin-Artajo and Grout do not live in the U.S., and made the sensible decision not to come to the U.S. just to be put in jail.) But it recently became untenable, and on Friday prosecutors dropped the case: Yes well. Iksil's discussion of the mis-marking, in a lengthy PDF on his website, is part impenetrable and part complainy and part exculpatory, and doesn't seem like it would be all that helpful to prosecutors. Who knows what the memoir will be like? (I mean, it's a good guess that it'll be fun.) There is perhaps a lesson here for prosecutors, which is, don't cut a deal to let the main player in an alleged conspiracy cooperate against the tangential figures. That might not work out, and also, there's no reason it should work out. Oh Wells Fargo. Here is a goofy story about a former Wells Fargo & Co. employee, Gary Sinderbrand, who is suing his brother for defamation, as one does. The brother also works at Wells Fargo, and Sinderbrand subpoenaed some Wells Fargo documents as part of the case, and Wells Fargo apparently misread the subpoena and thought it was supposed to send him all of its documents? So now Sinderbrand is in possession of ""copious spreadsheets with customers’ names and Social Security numbers, paired with financial details like the size of their investment portfolios and the fees the bank charged them,"" as well as ""extensive information on Wells Fargo’s financial advisers employed by the bank, their performance, their compensation and their client lists."" Oops! This is not supposed to happen, and is very embarrassing for Wells Fargo, and for reasons that I cannot quite make out, Sinderbrand did an extended end-zone dance to celebrate receiving the data: After ""noting that a less scrupulous recipient of such data could have easily posted it online,"" he instead showed it to the New York Times, which published some mild blind items. (""One file, for example, contained details on the holdings of a well-known hedge fund billionaire who had at least $23 million invested through Wells Fargo Advisors."") Wells Fargo has asked him to return the files, but he ... hasn't? He's just making ominous noises about what a less scrupulous person might do with them? Nobody comes off well here. I guess the point is that a bank's information security procedures are only as strong as their weakest link, and that sometimes that weakest link is the outside discovery vendor for an outside law firm responding to a defamation lawsuit in which the bank is not a party. Also it is probably best not to sue your brother if you can help it. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. In Friday's Money Stuff there was some half-joking speculation about what U.S. law enforcement authorities would do with all the bitcoins they keep seizing from criminals, and about a thousand of you e-mailed to point out that the answer is already settled: They auction them off. One reader also pointed out that there's another settled approach, which is that the law-enforcement agents steal the bitcoins from their own agencies. That does seem a bit more in keeping with the spirit of bitcoin. Elsewhere, here is Paul Murphy on Monkey Capital, a ""decentralised hedge fund"" that is doing an initial coin offering with both a white paper and a yellow paper. I do not know why it requires two papers, or what the colors signify, but it seems like a good time. And here is Elaine Ou on ""Ethereum's Eternal September.""  People are worried that people aren't worried enough. The CBOE Volatility Index has now closed under 10 for seven straight trading days, the longest streak ever. (The previous record was four days in 1993.) So markets are exceptionally quiet. Obviously people worry: People are worried about unicorns and also stock buybacks. Here is Rana Foroohar with the twofer: The unicorn worry is that there are fewer initial public offerings, and that now ""the goal of an IPO is all too often for investors to 'exit' with as high a valuation as possible"" instead of to raise operating capital. The buyback worry is that they encourage short-termism, and so Foroohar calls for ""making share buybacks illegal."" One interesting question here is: Would banning share buybacks by public companies make private companies more or less likely to go public? On the one hand, imposing more rules on public companies should make being public less attractive: Why go public and be more restricted, when you can stay private and do whatever you want? On the other hand, it seems to me that the right way to think about a lot of these issues is as a power struggle between entrepreneurs and investors. Share buybacks are an essentially pro-shareholder tool, a way to discipline managers and prevent them from wasting shareholder money on wasteful ideas. If public companies aren't allowed to do buybacks, then their managers will have more power and their shareholders will have less. And if entrepreneur-managers are the ones making the decision to go public, they might actually like a rule against buybacks: They might find it less a restriction on their freedom, and more a protection against their shareholders. People are worried about gray rhinos. I don't expect this section to recur too often, but obviously a metaphorical financial animal with a central horn belongs in Money Stuff, so here we are: Elsewhere in gray-rhino fears: ""Banks That Funded HNA's $40 Billion Spending Spree Halt New Loans.""  Things happen.

2017-07-20T14:16:48.351Z,Criminals' Online Market Targeted by U.S. After Founder Dies,"Bob Van Voris
         & Chris Strohm
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-20/u-s-looks-to-seize-assets-tied-to-dark-web-site-alphabay,"The U.S. government sued to seize luxury cars, international real estate and bitcoins owned by the alleged mastermind of AlphaBay, the biggest criminal marketplace on the dark web, just days after he reportedly hanged himself in his jail cell. AlphaBay was allegedly created in 2014 by Alexandre Cazes, a 26-year-old Canadian living in Thailand. It had 200,000 users and 40,000 sellers with about 369,000 listings for drugs, guns, fake IDs, malware and other illegal goods when it was shut down this month, according to the government. That makes it 10 times bigger than the Silk Road drug bazaar that ended with its founder’s arrest in 2013, the U.S. said. ""Most of this activity was in illegal drugs, pouring fuel on the fire of the national drug epidemic,"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions said in a press conference in Washington Thursday. ""As of earlier this year, 122 vendors advertised fentanyl and 238 advertised heroin, and we know of several Americans who were killed by drugs sold on Alpha Bay."" Cazes, known online as ""Alpha02,"" ran the website from its inception and controlled massive profits generated from the operation, collecting tens of millions of dollars in commissions, the government said. Cazes was arrested in Thailand on July 5, a day after the website was taken down at the request of the U.S. According to the Bangkok Post, Thai police said Cazes hanged himself in jail where he was being held pending extradition to the U.S. Users accessed AlphaBay on The Onion Router, or TOR, a network of computers designed to hide the identity of users, according to the government. Customers bought illegal goods using digital currencies, the U.S. said. Among the items the U.S. sued to seize are a 2013 Lamborghini Aventador, a Porsche Panamera, a BMW motorcycle, properties in Thailand, Cyprus, Liechtenstein and Antigua and Barbuda, and digital currencies including bitcoins, ethereum and ZCash. AlphaBay was taken down through the efforts of law enforcement authorities in the U.S. Thailand, the Netherlands, Lithuania, Canada, France and the U.K., according to the government. Law enforcement authorities in December discovered a link between Cazes’ personal email account, ""Pimp_Alex_91@hotmail.com,"" and the AlphaBay site. Agents then traced the information to Cazes in Bangkok, according to the government. A federal judge in Fresno, California, issued a warrant for his arrest based on a June 1 indictment made public today, which charged Cazes with 16 criminal counts, including conspiracy, money laundering and computer crimes. Between May and July, agents made undercover buys of marijuana, heroin, fentanyl, methamphetamine, fake IDs and an ATM skimmer for stealing payment card information. On July 5, the Royal Thai Police, with help from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and Drug Enforcement Agency, arrested Cazes in his Bangkok home. Agents found his laptop open and logged into AlphaBay’s server as ""Admin,"" according to prosecutors. The laptop contained a financial statement listing Cazes’ net worth as $23 million. Cazes died July 12 while in custody. Hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal goods were sold through AlphaBay, with the website taking a commission of 2 to 4 percent, according to the government. Day-to-day operations were run with the help of as many as ten anonymous employees who went by names that included ""Disc0,"" ""Trappy,"" ""BigMuscles,"" ""Botah,"" ""Onionhood"" and ""MountainHigh9."" Silk Road, formerly the biggest illegal online marketplace, operated from 2011 to 2013. The site’s creator, Ross William Ulbricht, known online as ""Dread Pirate Roberts,"" was convicted of conspiracy and drug trafficking in 2015 and sentenced to life in prison. Prosecutors said AlphaBay didn’t disguise the fact that its activities violated many laws. An entry on its ""Frequently Asked Questions"" section asked, ""Is AlphaBay Market Legal?"" The answer, according to prosecutors: ""Some people have really asked this question. Of course not. We are an anonymous marketplace selling drugs, weapons and credit cards. Make sure you access the website through Tor or through a VPN to ensure anonymity. We take no responsibility if you get caught, so protecting yourself is your responsibility."" The case is U.S. v.

2017-07-18T07:05:47.433Z,Bitcoin Jumps After First Solution to Major Ideological Divide,"Yuji Nakamura
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-18/bitcoin-jumps-as-miners-take-first-step-to-avoid-currency-split,"Bitcoin reversed steep losses as miners began using new software which aims to bridge an ideological gap that has threatened to divide the cryptocurrency. Bitcoin’s community has been at bitter odds for more than two years about how to solve its scaling problem, which has hampered the cryptocurrency’s growth and allowed rivals like ethereum to steal some of the spotlight. The new software, known as SegWit2x, is seen as a compromise for the two sides of the debate: miners who deploy costly computers to verify transactions and act as the backbone of the blockchain, and developers known as Core who uphold bitcoin’s bug-free software. While both sides have incentives to reach a consensus, bitcoin’s lack of central authority has made reaching agreement difficult. The price of bitcoin rose to as high as $2,356 before trading at $2,348 as of 2:22 p.m. in New York. The digital currency slumped to as low as $1,758 over the weekend on Coinbase’s exchange. Bitcoin, which has more than doubled this year, climbed to just shy of $3,000 on June 12. SegWit2x was formally released over the weekend and has already gained adoption by large miners Antpool, BTCC and Bixin. About 55 percent of blocks mined in the last 24 hours were done with SegWit2x, according to coin.dance, which monitors blockchain activity. If support reaches 80 percent and maintains that threshold from more than two days, it will move bitcoin closer to avoiding a split. “Traders are excited by the prospect of a resolution to the scaling debate, which is why the price has rallied,” said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Read more about bitcoin’s civil war. Despite the progress with SegWit2x, some warned that bitcoin isn’t out of the woods yet. Many Core members still vehemently oppose the software, which they say hasn’t been properly vetted for bugs. Also, not all miners support SegWit2x, which they say is a flawed compromise that doesn’t solve the root scaling problem. “This price rally is a bounce, we are very bearish in the near term for a number of reasons,” said Harry Yeh, managing partner at digital currency dealer Binary Financial, who cites the lack of support from Core developers as one of his biggest worries. “Anytime the price rockets up quickly, it will be followed by a strong correction which we are starting to see. We are definitely headed for some turbulent and volatile times in the short term.” — With assistance by Lulu Yilun Chen"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/bitcoin-falls-below-2-000-as-infighting-threatens-crypto-perch,"Bitcoin fell below $2,000 for the first time since May amid anxiety its dominant status is under threat. As enthusiasts consider adopting competing updates to the blockchain technology that underpins the exchange method by the end of July, it has raised the possibility of the cryptocurrency splitting in two.  Bitcoin has lost about a third of its value since peaking at about $3,000 last month. Calls for a revamp of the software come as exchanges struggled to keep up with rising volumes while the price almost tripled this year. Bitcoin isn’t the only one struggling as the two competing camps -- miners and developers -- are facing off over how to deal with increasing transaction times and processing fees. The 30 largest cryptocurrencies have all suffered declines over the past seven days, according to data from coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin has lost about 20 percent of its market value, while the second-biggest digital coin -- ethereum -- has lost 30 percent. Cryptocurrency exchange GDAX said it anticipates temporarily suspending bitcoin deposits and withdrawals after the Aug. 1 software update deadline, and may also pause trading. ""In either scenario we will implement safeguards to ensure the safety of our customers’ funds,"" the exchange said in a July 13 post on its website. ""This decision will be based on our assessment of the technical risks posed by the fork, such as replay attacks and other factors that could create network instability.""

2017-07-21T13:12:39.267Z,Russian Deals and Petri-Dish Funds,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-21/russian-deals-and-petri-dish-funds,"Russia sanctions. Yesterday the U.S. Department of the Treasury fined Exxon Mobil Corp. $2 million for violating U.S. sanctions against Russia back when Exxon was run by current U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. So, you know, politically, that's weird. It's also quite weird legally! Exxon entered into some deals with Rosneft OAO, an oil company majority-owned by the Russian government whose chief executive officer is Igor Sechin. Rosneft is not subject to sanctions, and U.S. companies are allowed to do deals with it. But Sechin is subject to U.S. sanctions, and U.S. companies are not allowed to do deals with him. Exxon did its deals with Rosneft, so it thought it was fine. But the contracts were signed by Sechin, which the Treasury thinks is not fine. So Treasury fined Exxon $2 million -- the ""statutory maximum civil monetary penalty"" for the violation, which is a little embarrassing -- and issued a sharply worded judgment calling the violations ""an egregious case."" Meanwhile ""a spokesman for Exxon called the fine 'outrageous' and said it would fight the Treasury’s findings, saying they are a 180-degree turn from previous guidance handed down by the Obama administration when the sanctions were enacted."" It has sued to stop the fine. I guess my instinctual sympathies are with Exxon here: If you're allowed to do deals with Rosneft, then you should be allowed to do deals with Rosneft, even if -- as you'd imagine he often does -- Rosneft's CEO signs those deals. Otherwise what is the point of leaving Rosneft off the list? Exxon's distinction -- that doing deals with Sechin personally is banned, but that doing deals with his company in which he is involved purely in his role as a corporate officer is fine -- makes sense; Treasury's view -- that doing deals with Rosneft where the CEO signs a piece of paper is banned, while doing deals with Rosneft where the CEO just nods and someone else signs the paper is fine -- is sort of trivial and formalistic. But more importantly you'd just think there would be a clear answer to this question; if you're sanctioning CEOs of giant companies while not sanctioning their companies, then this issue is going to come up a lot. And in fact it does. Treasury pointed to the Frequently Asked Questions on its website to argue that Exxon should have known better: I guess that clears it up then? I am not sure that the FAQ is as binding as Treasury wants it to be though. Hedge fund biology. Here is a story about how a computational biologist named Desmond Lun is running a successful quant hedge fund, and more generally about how computational biologists are the new hotness in quantitative finance: Emanuel Derman has his doubts: I don't know. Lun's background is in studying algae to predict how they will behave. I suppose you could argue that the interactions of investors in the stock market are more sophisticated and unpredictable than the interactions of algae in a petri dish. It is tempting to take the other side. They are all just organisms, bashing into each other, fighting for survival. Anyway a lot of the interesting philosophical questions in quantitative investing are about whether quants' models need to be comprehensible to their human masters: Are you building essentially a big calculator to help you make investing decisions, or are you building essentially a big brain to make investing decisions that you don't even understand? Lun seems to be somewhere in the middle, leaning toward the incomprehensible camp. (""On any given day, I can't explain all the factors that led to the system reaching that decision."") But if your vision of quant investing is that it involves building a big external brain to go off and do its own thinking, I guess a biologist is well equipped to do that? A pretty good hedge fund pitch would be ""we have hired some really good biologists to clone Warren Buffett, and then we're going to lock Warren-2 in a room, feed him burgers and Coke, and make him pick stocks."" Boring. Last year hilarious Twitter prankster Elon Musk founded a hilarious prank company with the hilarious prank name ""The Boring Company"" and the hilarious prank purpose of drilling tunnels in the ground to get around traffic. Yesterday he tweeted a hilarious prank tweet saying that he ""Just received verbal govt approval for The Boring Company to build an underground NY-Phil-Balt-DC Hyperloop."" Next, one assumes, he will assemble a quirky cast of Wes-Anderson-movie characters, put them in jumpsuits, get them a big drill, and send them out to start drilling holes in the middle of traffic in what I think everyone will agree is a hilarious prank. Or, I don't know, maybe all of this is real? Of course ""a White House spokesman confirmed that the administration has had 'promising conversations to date' with Musk and Boring Company executives,"" because the current White House also believes in governance by hilarious prank. Also Musk really does have a drill, which has its own hilarious prank name: Of course setting up a white-hot Silicon Valley startup, hiring interns, and then putting them to work drilling holes in the ground is itself a hilarious prank. I think a lot about that New Yorker article from last year that discussed the Silicon Valley obsession with the ""simulation hypothesis,  the argument that what we experience as reality is in fact fabricated in a computer,"" and noted that ""two tech billionaires have gone so far as to secretly engage scientists to work on breaking us out of the simulation."" (Everyone assumes that one or both of them are Musk and/or his fellow PayPal founder Peter Thiel.) My familiarity with the simulation hypothesis comes mostly from watching ""The Matrix,"" and I don't really know how one would break us out of the simulation, but judging by ""The Matrix"" one promising approach seems to be to create absurd conditions within our world in order to convince everyone that it is not real. So Thiel worked to get Donald Trump elected as president of the United States, and Musk is ... boring. Perhaps he is really drilling holes in the fabric of reality, to break us out of the simulation. How do you get more IPOs? We have talked a couple of times about the Security and Exchange Commission's new focus on getting more companies to go public, so that ""Mr. and Mrs. 401(k)"" -- as SEC Chairman Jay Clayton calls them -- can invest in innovative growing businesses in the public markets. Clayton, like a lot of people, talks about this in terms of onerous SEC disclosure requirements for public companies: Companies aren't going public because there are so many forms to fill out, and by just reducing the disclosure requirements we can encourage more initial public offerings. I tend to think that the reason is a bit deeper, and that part of why companies are staying private longer is just that private capital is more abundant, and private markets are more sophisticated, than they used to be. Being public has always been more annoying than being private, for entrepreneurs: As a private company you essentially get to pick your shareholders, and you can build a cozy relationship with them that gives you durable control of your business with stable funding from trusted investors. Public companies just have to take whatever shareholders they get, if they're activists or high-frequency traders or litigious pension funds or whatever. But of course public markets have always been where the money is, so if you want to raise a lot of money -- and get liquidity for your nice early investors -- you have to go public. Or you had to; now, you can raise billions of dollars in private markets and even have something of a secondary market, so the economic imperative to go public is reduced. If that's right, then it's a change that can't be reversed just by reducing disclosure rules. ""If you want to flush all the unicorns out of the Enchanted Forest and into 401(k) accounts,"" I said last week, ""you might need to do more than reduce the length of Form 10-K filings: You might need to make more fundamental changes to how public companies interact with their shareholders."" And this week here is SEC Commissioner Michael Piwowar: There you go: You can go public, and have public shareholders, but if you don't like litigious public shareholders then you can just make them give up their right to sue. Of course there have been other recent experiments in fundamentally changing how public companies interact with their shareholders: Several big private equity firms have gone public while eliminating directors' fiduciary duties to their shareholders, and Snap Inc. went public while eliminating shareholder voting rights. If you're a founder who doesn't want to give up control of your company, but who wants to raise money publicly, now you can have a public company whose shareholders can't vote, can't sue the company, and can't expect directors to act in their best interests. Investors will let you get away with it -- until something goes horribly wrong with one of those companies, anyway -- and now so will the SEC. That's a pretty good offer! It might even make being public more attractive than being private. It has very little to do with how much audits cost, or how many pages are in the annual report.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Law enforcement authorities shut down AlphaBay, a big ""dark net"" market for ""deadly illegal drugs, stolen and fraudulent identification documents and access devices, counterfeit goods, malware and other computer hacking tools, firearms, and toxic chemicals,"" arresting its 25-year-old creator Alexandre Cazes, who committed suicide in a Thai jail. The authorities also took ""millions of dollars' worth of cryptocurrencies"" from Cazes and AlphaBay. ""We're literally funding our own investigations,"" one Reddit user realized. Eventually U.S. law enforcement authorities are going to be among the biggest holders of cryptocurrency in the world. What will they do with it? You can't exactly use bitcoins for military procurement, though I guess AlphaBay did sell firearms. Will they start paying FBI agents in bitcoin? Will they sell their currencies for cash on lightly-regulated exchanges to unknown purchasers who might have nefarious uses for their bitcoins? Will they invest in initial coin offerings like everyone else?  Elsewhere: ""Bitcoin Community Cheers as Miners Back New Scaling Framework."" People are worried that people aren't worried enough. My own cheerful spin on all the worries about eerily low volatility has been: What if markets just got smarter? We've long known that stock markets overreact to news. Now we have all these calm index funds that don't trade in and out of the hottest stocks, and we have all these algorithmic investment funds that try to profit by spotting stock-market anomalies, like (perhaps) the one about overreacting to news. Whatever insights scientific finance has managed to gain are being put to work in investment management: Shouldn't that make the market more efficient? Shouldn't prices move quickly to the correct level and stay there until something fundamental changes, rather than bouncing around like crazy due to whim and panic and uncertainty?  Everyone I talk to about this theory thinks it is stupid, and they have a fair point: We've had hundreds of years of experience with financial markets, and while humanity has gained a lot of knowledge over that time, the basic financial cycle of booms and busts has not changed much. Still I am an optimist; it would be a little odd if those hundreds of years of experience didn't make markets any better at incorporating information. Anyway here's a Wall Street Journal article about ""How Quants Calm the Stock Market"": Things happen.

Republican healthcare plans implode, China's resolve for financial stability swells, strengths turn into weakness for a pair of U.S. banks. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. The votes aren't there for a straight repeal of the Affordable Care Act in the U.S. Senate, which was Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's next step less than 24 hours after support for the replacement plan was also found wanting. President Donald Trump now says the Republicans will ""let Obamacare fail"" in a bid to avoid owning the healthcare issue. Wall Street strategists are warning that the impasse may jeopardize the administration's fiscal wishes, which include tax reductions and a boost in infrastructure spending. The primary fallout in financial markets Tuesday was greenback weakness. The legislative quagmire is causing headaches for insurers, who are unsure about the way forward since the law remains in limbo. Additionally, the struggle to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act has taken an acute toll on House Speaker Paul Ryan's popularity. Beijing's push to maintain stability and mitigate risks to its financial system continues, with the nation's banking regulator reportedly telling lenders to lower rates offered on wealth-management products. Meanwhile, liquidity conditions are tightening again, with overnight repurchase rates jumping despite a sizeable injection of funds by the People's Bank of China. The renewed deleveraging drive rattled Chinese stocks, especially small caps, early in the week but a late-day rally Tuesday pushed benchmark gauges into positive territory on the session. The softness in Chinese stocks -- the world's worst this year -- has pushed investors to seek refuge in equities listed in Hong Kong. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Bank of America Corp. both posted better-than-expected second quarter earnings Tuesday morning, but that wasn't enough to keep them from retreating as investors focused on soft spots in their businesses. For Goldman, the results revealed its worst first-half performance for trading revenue during Lloyd Blankfein's tenure, while Bank of America posted a surprise drop in net interest income. This weakness in these traditionally standout segments contributed to the down days for each bank.  The Nasdaq Composite Index closed at records with its heavyweights -- Netflix, Facebook, Amazon, and Google -- leading the way higher. The S&P 500 Index also managed to inch higher to an all-time high despite softness in the financials. Shares of Chipotle Mexican Grill, however, swooned after reports that a handful of customers became ill after eating at one of its Virginia restaurants. Bitcoin spiked after miners began to employ new software that may help different factions reach a compromise and enable the cryptocurrency to scale up. West Texas Intermediate futures traded above $46 per barrel, with the advance fueled by a report Saudi Arabia may deepen its export cuts. The Australian dollar soared to a two-year high against the U.S. dollar Tuesday following the release of minutes from the Reserve Bank of Australia's July meeting, in which it struck a more hawkish tone than the statement released two weeks ago. Bulls now see the currency breaching 80 cents versus the greenback in short order. S&P/ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 futures are virtually flat ahead of the open Wednesday. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."
2017-07-18T17:40:33.386Z,Ethereum Co-Founder Says Crypto Coin Market Is a Time-Bomb,"Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-18/ethereum-co-founder-says-crypto-coin-market-is-ticking-time-bomb,"Initial coin offerings, a means of crowdfunding for blockchain-technology companies, have caught so much attention that even the co-founder of the ethereum network, where many of these digital coins are built, says it’s time for things to cool down in a big way. “People say ICOs are great for ethereum because, look at the price, but it’s a ticking time-bomb,” Charles Hoskinson, who helped develop ethereum, said in an interview. “There’s an over-tokenization of things as companies are issuing tokens when the same tasks can be achieved with existing blockchains. People are blinded by fast and easy money.” Firms have raised $1.3 billion this year in digital coin sales, surpassing venture capital funding of blockchain companies and up more than six-fold from the total raised last year, according to Autonomous Research. Ether, the digital currency linked to the ethereum blockchain, surged from around $8 after its ICO at the start of the year to just under $400 last month. It’s since dropped by about 50 percent. Hoskinson, who runs technology research firm IOHK, is part of a growing chorus of blockchain watchers voicing concern about the rapid surge in cryptocurrency prices and digital coin crowdsales that have collected millions of dollars in minutes. Regulation is the biggest risk to the sector, as it’s likely that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which has remained on the sidelines, will step in to say that digital coins are securities, he said. Startups raising money through ICOs usually skip the safeguards required in traditional securities sales, like making sure they’re dealing with accredited investors and verifying the source of funds. That could lead to lawsuits in the future, as digital coin buyers can sue the issuer claiming they didn’t know the risks of buying those assets, Hoskinson said. Read more on the hack of CoinDash’s ICO Hoskinson joined the ethereum founding team in late 2013 and left in June 2014 as he advocated for a for-profit entity while others in the team led by Vitalik Buterin wanted to keep it as not-for-profit. Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse had a similar view regarding regulatory risks. Teams listing companies offshore and selling their coins to investors outside the U.S. are naïve to think there are no investor protection laws elsewhere, and also expects that the SEC will eventually say cryptocurrencies are securities, he said in an interview last week. Ripple is a money-transfer company based on the blockchain technology, that’s tied to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value. “ICOs operating in the Wild West of finance isn’t sustainable,” Garlinghouse said. “If it talks like a duck and walks like a duck, the SEC will say it’s a duck.” Besides the growing concern about an ICO bubble and regulatory concerns, ether trading outages stemming from the jump in transactions, companies cashing in on the money raised in crowdsales, yesterday’s $7 million CoinDash hack and even false rumors that Buterin had died, have all contributed to the tumble in the price of ether. Concern about bitcoin potentially splitting in two is also sending jitters throughout the crypto world. Still, like Ripple’s Garlinghouse, Hoskinson thinks once the currency ICO bubble deflates, cryptocurrencies will continue to be an avenue for companies to raise money, but it will be done in a regulated and more constrained environment. “Regardless of regulation ICOs are here to stay,” he said. “After it collapses they’re going to pick up the pieces and say how do we do things differently.”"

A popular workaround used to be to use a virtual private network to access the internet free from snooping eyes. But last week, the government decided those have to go as well, demanding carriers block all VPNs by February 2018.

2017-07-17T13:31:20.489Z,"Researchers, Traders and Energy Funds","Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-17/researchers-traders-and-energy-funds,"Research insider trading. We have talked before about the Securities and Exchange Commission's case against Gregory Bolan and Joseph Ruggieri, two former Wells Fargo Securities employees. Bolan was a research analyst, and Ruggieri was a trader, and sometimes Ruggieri would buy a stock shortly before Bolan would put out a Buy recommendation on that stock, and the SEC concluded that was suspicious insider trading. Or, rather, the SEC's Enforcement Division concluded it was insider trading. But it brought the case in one of its own courts -- before an SEC administrative law judge -- and that SEC judge concluded that it was not insider trading. (By Ruggieri; Bolan settled.) And then the SEC appealed, and the way that the SEC appeals from its own courts is by appealing to the SEC -- like, to the actual commissioners of the SEC. And so the SEC heard the SEC's case, and concluded that the SEC was wrong. Just barely: Only two SEC commissioners heard the case, and one (Kara Stein) agreed with the Enforcement Division, but the other one (Michael Piwowar) didn't, and the tie went to Ruggieri. So: not insider trading. When we first talked about the case, I pointed out the essential oddity of the research analyst/trader relationship. The analyst is supposed to know stuff about stocks. The trader is supposed to buy and sell stocks. They are colleagues, on the same team. Of course the trader should call up the analyst and ask him ""hey will this stock go up?"" before buying the stock; that is just common sense. On the other hand, the analyst's Buy/Sell/Hold rating on the stock, between the time he formulates it and the time he publishes it, is material nonpublic information, and he is not supposed to share it with the trader before he shares it with everyone. So the analyst can tell the trader to buy the stock any time, but he can only tell him to Buy the stock if he has a public Buy recommendation. Or something like that. That nuance is easy to miss. The SEC Enforcement Division pointed out that Ruggieri traded ahead of Bolan's ratings changes on four occasions, and that Ruggieri and Bolan talked by phone before each of those trades. Sounds suspicious! But as Commissioner Piwowar points out: The policy is to encourage active communication between traders and analysts, but also to make sure that traders don't know about analysts' recommendation changes before they are public. You can see how that might be difficult to police. Energy.  Here is the story of EnerVest Ltd., a private equity fund that bought producing oil and gas wells, levered them up with fund-level debt, and used the proceeds to return 30 percent annual profits to its investors. Until it raised a $2 billion fund in 2013, oil prices crashed, and that fund went roughly to zero, ""wiping out investments by major pensions, endowments and charitable foundations,"" and perhaps marking ""the first time that a fund larger than $1 billion has lost essentially all of its value."" Oops!  No, I mean, I can see how you wouldn't be. But I sympathize. There is a tension, in thinking about investment returns, between the obvious purpose shared by every investment fund and the specific purpose of any individual fund. Every fund is supposed to make money; making more money is better than making less money, and losing all your money is very bad. On the other hand, EnerVest's pitch to pensions and endowments and charitable foundations wasn't ""we're going to try to make money somehow, preferably without losing all of it."" It had a specific mandate. Those institutions wanted levered exposure to U.S. oil and gas wells, in 2013, when oil prices were north of $80 per barrel. That turned out to be a bad thing to want, or get. In some sense that is EnerVest's fault; no doubt EnerVest was also pretty jazzed about the oil-well-investing opportunity in 2013, and pitched it enthusiastically to investors. But pensions, endowments and charitable foundations aren't investing in funds like this out of pure trust in the funds' absolute returns: They wanted a specific mix of exposures in their overall funds, and they decided that some of their risk should be allocated to oil, and that EnerVest was a good way to get exposure to oil prices. And it was! It was an extremely efficient delivery mechanism for what turned out to be a bad risk. But that is not EnerVest's fault. You can't compare every alternative fund's performance to the S&P 500 Index, or even to, you know, zero. EnerVest gave investors what they wanted, oil exposure, even if it didn't give them what they really wanted: money. FTT. At a very high level, there are two opposing ways to think about finance: I am old enough to remember when the financial transaction tax was not just a way for governments to raise revenue, but also a symbolic way for governments to express suspicion about finance. Aren't there just too many financial transactions? Aren't they too high-frequency, too speculative? Don't they lead to constantly recurring crises, for which the financial sector doesn't pay its fair share? Shouldn't we tax all those transactions, to discourage them and slow them down and ground finance in the real world of social obligations? Apparently not: Ahahaha. The financial sector is so important and attractive that France and Germany are vying desperately to attract banks from the U.K. after Brexit. Taxing financial transactions doesn't exactly fit with that message; that was more of a six-years-ago approach. ""Jamie Dimon tells financial journalists to stop writing about finance."" That is the excellent Financial Times headline, about Jamie Dimon's fun speech on JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s earnings call last Friday: As someone who has spent years making fun of worrying about bond market liquidity, I have some sympathy. But the weird thing here is that Dimon was supposedly offered the job of Treasury Secretary in the Trump administration, and turned it down to focus more on fixed income trading and yelling at journalists. I gather that a big part of the job of being Treasury Secretary is getting regulation and tax things done, while running a global investment bank involves a lot of fixed income trading. And yet: revealed preferences. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Guys there is such an amazing efflorescence of initial coin offerings that I can't really keep up. My current favorite ICO might be The SAFE Token: The alleged former Goldman partner ""would like to stay anonymous,"" though there's a video at that link where you can maybe hear him talking in a computerized voice. Anyway the point of the SAFE Token is that its price is based on ""square root of bitcoin mining difficulty."" (There's a white paper.) How does that ... work? The white paper doesn't say! One interpretation is that it is a bitcoin derivative, sold to you by a person, that pays off based on that formula. But it is also ... an ICO? They are doing an offering of SAFE Tokens, which will then be a tradable thing. ""As the SAFE is a healthy structure, much less volatile than Bitcoin, it will become the 'safe heaven' and will have a preferable supply/demand structure as it becomes a favored asset as Bitcoin prices fall."" (Yes, it repeatedly says ""safe heaven."") But who will pay cash for the SAFE token at the formula price? I don't know! The point is that we're all having fun. Or there is this: Cool, definitely, a platform for talking about and trading stocks is worthless garbage here in 2017, while a platform for talking about and trading cryptocurrencies is the future. ""Cryptocurrencies, especially newer alt coins, suffer from lack of exposure,"" says the InvestFeed white paper, implausibly. But why does it have to come with an ICO? InvestFeed is not just a data and discussion platform; it is also a coin: Part of the original cryptocurrency dream was that it would enable micropayments: If you can easily and instantly transfer money using bitcoin, then you can pay people to comment on your blog, or pay them not to comment on your blog, or charge them for commenting on your blog, or whatever. It is a nice currency-ish function for bitcoin. But the new ICO dream seems to be a million different currencies for a million types of micropayments. Now, you can set up a blog, and set up a currency to pay/charge people for commenting on your blog, and then sell that currency for cash, and as your blog gets more popular the currency gets more valuable. As a way to fund blogging, it ... I guess it provides economic incentives so that the rational behavior of individuals results in common good? And yet it seems like a step backward in the division of labor. Now, to set up a website, you don't just need to have technical skills and good content. You also need to reinvent the notion of money, but for your website. Meanwhile Tezos, the biggest ICO to date, has raised $230 million to build a blockchain that is more decentralized than the other decentralized blockchains. And: ""The price of the digital currency bitcoin fell over the weekend, dropping below $2,000 and farther away from its June highs, part of a broad selloff in dozens of cryptocurrencies, including ether."" And: ""A Brief History of Blockchain: An Investor’s Perspective."" People are worried that people aren't worried enough. ""Washington is in gridlock and the White House faces scrutiny. Valuations are at the highest levels since the financial crisis."" Guess where this is heading? Of course: ""The CBOE Volatility Index ended at 9.51, a 24-year low, falling 15 percent."" People, measured by the VIX, are as unworried as they have been since 1993. I remember 1993. 1993 did not feel like 2017, except VIX-wise I guess. People are worried about unicorns. ""What's the absolute maximum number of dog collars you'd like to buy this year,"" asks Adam Ozimek. ""Probably less than twelve?"" And yet Good Day Dog offers a monthly dog collar subscription service. One of the bubblier features of the modern tech market is how the basic function of putting basic physical goods in a box and mailing them to your house is now somehow thought of as ""tech."" Meanwhile in the business of chopping fruits and vegetables, putting them in a bag, and mailing the bag to your house, where you can squeeze juice out of the bag with your hands or, if you are feeling tech-enabled, with an internet-connected machine, Juicero Inc. ""is undergoing a 'strategic shift' to lower the cost of its $399 machines and juice packs filled with raw fruits and vegetables on an accelerated timeline."" The strategic shift involves laying off a quarter of its staff. Elsewhere, Elon Musk is worried about artificial intelligence: It feels sort of appropriate that the two big risks to the tech industry are (1) that many tech startups are essentially unambitious repackagings of low-tech grocery-delivery businesses and (2) that tech firms will build robots so advanced that they will take over the world and destroy human civilization. People are worried about stock buybacks. Gretchen Morgenson is worried about stock buybacks, particularly at pharmaceutical companies, many of which spend more on buybacks and dividends than they do on research and development. I tend to take an accounting view of things like this: A pharmaceutical company wants to have revenue that exceeds its expenses to make a profit for its investors. Revenue is revenue. Research and development are expenses. Buybacks and dividends are not; they are just ways to return profits to investors. If the pharmaceutical companies took all the money they spent on buybacks and dividends, which are not expenses, and instead spent it on research, which is, then their expenses would (say) double. Then they'd need to (say) double their revenue to make an acceptable profit for their investors. Perhaps the extra research would yield such great drugs that they'd easily double their revenue. But remember these are companies that are already spending billions of dollars on their most promising research opportunities. If they spent billions more dollars on their less promising opportunities, presumably those opportunities would be ... less promising. So what do you do when your expenses grow but your revenue does not? I gather that if you are a drug company, you raise the prices of your drugs. Morgenson also discusses a recent study about companies who have bought back more than their entire current market capitalizations: J. C. Penney! Sears Holdings! The way you get on this list is by (1) buying a lot of stock and (2) having low or negative growth. The implication is that (1) causes (2), but (2) could equally easily cause (1). What do you think Sears Holdings Corp. (current market capitalization: $865 million, market capitalization 10 years ago: over $20 billion) would be worth if it hadn't done any buybacks? Would it have invested in research, automation, new business models? Would it have built itself into a viable competitor to Amazon? Or is it possible that profitable companies in dying industries should take their profits and give them back to shareholders to re-invest in growing industries? Things happen.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-14/bitcoin-on-pace-for-biggest-weekly-decline-since-march-chart,"Bitcoin declined about 14 percent this week, the biggest five-day slide since January, as rival enthusiasts of the digital currency consider adopting two competing software updates at the end of July. That has raised the possibility that bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the cryptocurrency market. Still, bitcoin has more than doubled this year amid greater acceptance of the blockchain technology that underpins the exchange method."
2017-07-14T09:00:01.000Z,John Mack Takes Bitcoin Where Dread Pirate Feared to Tread,"Matthew Leising
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-14/mack-takes-bitcoin-where-dread-pirate-roberts-feared-to-tread,"The Dread Pirate Roberts was never going to persuade Wall Street to love bitcoin. Maybe John Mack can. Roberts was the swashbuckler alter ego of Ross Ulbricht, founder of the multimillion-dollar Silk Road online bazaar who’s serving a life sentence for allowing customers to use bitcoin to buy drugs, hacking tools and fake identification. Ulbricht’s was the early, ominous face of the cryptocurrency and no one on Wall Street wanted to touch it. What investors can no longer ignore is the incredible price gains -- almost 150 percent alone this year for bitcoin. Yet the problem of how to buy and sell digital assets while keeping compliance departments happy remains. Enter Mack, the former chief executive officer of Morgan Stanley. He’s taken an interest in Omega One, a startup that plans to act as an agency brokerage for asset managers and institutional investors who want to own cryptoassets like bitcoin and ether but don’t want to run afoul of know-your-customer and anti-money laundering regulations. Mack is one of a few private backers of Venture One, Omega One’s sole investor at this point. “I have been watching and investing in the cryptocurrency market over the last several years, and as a Venture One portfolio company, I find Omega One to be an important next step in the emergence of this new economy,” Mack said in an emailed statement. “We think Omega One is going to be transformative because it benefits the entire ecosystem -- making crypto assets cheaper and easier to access.” The need for a trusted firm to act as a middleman between the worlds of Wall Street and digital currencies is an indication of the growing pains these new markets face. Bitcoin has always been extremely volatile -- it has dropped about 20 percent since rising to a record last month -- a trait shared by ether and other digital coins. More than half of the computers that make up the bitcoin network are located in China, giving one nation outsized sway over the global market and leaving reputable investors cautious. And a history of alleged thefts and hacks in the last few years have shaken confidence in security measures employed by some digital asset exchanges. The uncertainty among conservative investors toward cryptocurrencies is playing right into Omega One’s strategy, according to Alex Gordon-Brander, the company’s chief technology officer. “We’re the bridge between the traditional capital markets and the crypto markets,” he said in an interview. “We will provide everything from balance sheet intermediation to a trusted counter party.” Wall Street has been captivated for the last two years by the prospect of applying blockchain technology to save banks billions of dollars a year in back office operations and slashing settlement times. A type of software that combines distributed computing and cryptography to make bitcoin and ether possible, blockchain is in a basic sense a shared database that has no central authority overseeing it. Rather than blockchain, however, Gordon-Brander said Omega One is focused on convincing the financial world that cryptocurrencies should be viewed as a new asset class.  There are a few signs of this already. Both Fidelity Investments and USAA allow customers to access their bitcoin or ether balances through their accounts if they are linked to the digital exchange Coinbase. Gordon-Brander said this is the year that attitudes will change. “We’re seeing the very first signs of institutional adoption of crypto markets,” he said. Investing in bitcoin has never been for the faint of heart. Within two months in late 2013 it shot up from about $125 in October to $1,150 in December, an 820 percent appreciation. Within two weeks, bitcoin fell to $520 on Dec. 18, 2013, according to price data from Coindesk. Earlier this year it dropped to $775 from $1,129 between Jan. 4 and Jan. 11, a 31 percent loss. And then in four months it went from $964 in March to a record above $3,000 in June to a current price of $2,233, according to Coindesk. Ether spent much of the second half of 2016 in a range between $10 and $12, then shot up to $396 over three months between March and June, an astounding 3,500 percent gain. It has since fallen 53 percent to a current price of about $187, according to Coindesk. The unregulated nature of bitcoin and ether may also bias traditional investors from getting involved. Bitcoin transactions are verified by so-called miners, who use powerful computers to ensure transactions are valid and the bitcoin belongs to the user who wants to transact with it. For verifying transactions, miners are rewarded an amount of free bitcoin. Chinese miners account for over 50 percent of this network, and the country also produces a large share of the computer hardware used to mine, according to Brian Forde, director of digital currency at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Digital Currency Iniative. That concentration risk may spur other countries to become involved in bitcoin mining to blunt China’s effect on the global market, he said earlier this year. There have been high profile losses of bitcoin and ether as well. The former head of Mt. Gox, the bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange that imploded in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of the cryptocurrency, began his trial earlier this week. Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles pleaded not guilty in Tokyo on Tuesday to charges of embezzlement and inflating corporate financial accounts. Last month, Korean Bitcoin exchange Bithumb was hacked and users’ personal information was stolen, according to the exchange. Last year, about $55 million worth of ether was stolen from the DAO, a smart contract meant to crowd-fund development projects on the ethereum blockchain. The money was later recovered. Omega One is also pitching itself to current cryptocurrency investors who want to limit transaction costs, Gordon-Brander said. He should know about that, as he previously was instrumental in building the algorithmic trading system for Bridgewater Associates, the world’s largest hedge fund. The system helped break up large currency orders for Bridgewater’s customers, a system known as smart order routing, to save Bridgewater’s clients money in foreign-exchange trades, he said. The same issue arises in cryptocurrency transactions, as difficulty in filling orders can cost users hundreds of dollars in transaction costs, he said. The system will be a dark pool, meaning orders are hidden, unlike a public exchange with an open order book. If Omega One can’t fill a trade from resting orders in the dark pool, it will be shipped off to other exchanges around the world for completion, Gordon-Brander said. Users of Omega One will have to possess a digital coin native to the system, what will be known as an Omega Token. The company plans to offer an initial coin offering in either mid-August or mid-September, Gordon-Brander said. He declined to say how much the ICO would raise, but put the range within hundreds of millions of dollars. That money will become the firm’s balance sheet that it will use to buy and sell bitcoin or ether on behalf of its customers, he said. “We can do a lot more with a $1 billion balance sheet than a $100 million balance sheet,” Gordon-Brander said. “The balance sheet is the grease that makes the liquidity work.” John Mack serves on boards including the Bloomberg Family Foundation, founded by Michael Bloomberg, the owner of Bloomberg LP, parent of Bloomberg News. — With assistance by Lily Katz"
2017-07-17T09:00:00.006Z,"Chipmakers Nvidia, AMD Ride Cryptocurrency Wave — for Now","Ian King
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-17/chipmakers-nvidia-amd-ride-cryptocurrency-wave-for-now,"During California’s Gold Rush, it was often the sellers of pickaxes and shovels who made the most money. In the frenzy to get rich quick from cryptocurrencies, some investors are calling computer chipmakers the modern-day equivalent. Shares of Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have gained at least 14 percent since the beginning of June, spurred in part by about a 10-fold boom from April to June in a market, known as ethereum, for a currency that can be used to buy computing power over the internet. What’s the link between ethereum and these Silicon Valley chipmakers? It lies in the really powerful graphics processors, designed to make computer games more realistic, that are also needed to gain access to encrypted digital currencies. Nvidia and AMD have rallied in the last month and a half even as investors have ignored chip stocks leaving the benchmark Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index up about 1 percent. Nvidia has gained 14 percent and AMD rallied 27 percent. While some of that has come from optimism around new products for other markets, analysts are projecting that sales related to cryptocurrencies will result in a spike in revenue for both companies. “The sharp increase in demand from cryptocurrency miners has rapidly depleted excess channel inventory” for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, Michael McConnell, an analyst at Pacific Crest Securities, wrote in a recent note to clients. “Surging demand from cryptocurrency miners in China and Eastern Europe since early May” will boost quarterly unit sales by as much as 20 percent, the analyst predicted, a sharp turnaround from his prior forecast that saw at least a 10 percent contraction in sales. Even so, investors shouldn’t bank on a lasting impact from the cryptocurrency boom, said Stacy Rasgon, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. “This has happened before,” Rasgon said. “It lasted about a quarter.” In the case of ethereum, digital-currency miners use machines outfitted with powerful chips to solve puzzles in a competition to win blocks of code. Those blocks of code are called ether, and they in turn act as tokens used in transactions on a new computing platform designed as an alternative to big internet providers like Amazon.com Inc. or Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Like bitcoin, ethereum is an attempt by an online community to create an economy that doesn’t rely on government-backed currencies. Unlike bitcoin, it’s focused solely on offering decentralized computing and storage services. Those seeking to use these services -- and speculators looking for a quick profit by creating and then selling ether -- have seized on graphics cards, which excel at performing multiple simple calculations in parallel, as a faster way to claim the blocks of code that act as the currency of the ethereum market. Demand from ethereum miners has created temporary shortages of some of the graphics cards, according to analysts, who cite sold-out products at online retailers. Estimates of additional sales from this demand run as high as $875 million, according to RBC Capital Markets analyst Mitch Steves. That would roughly equal AMD’s total sales from graphics chips last year, or half of Nvidia’s quarterly sales of those components. But Steves and other analysts are also quick to warn that the market opportunity could fizzle out. The first indication of just how much impact mining-gear sales are having will come when AMD reports earnings on July 25. Already there are signs that investors and speculators are becoming less interested in cryptocurrencies. Overall the sector, including bitcoin, the largest cryptocurrency has lost about a third of its market value since peaking in early June, according to Coindesk, pushing it into what traditional equity market analysts label as a bear market. Ethereum has fallen about 30 percent since July 4. Unlike the world of pickaxes and shovels, the technology of cryptocurrencies and computer graphics is constantly evolving. To ensure that the world isn’t flooded with new blocks of the code that make up ether’s value, the procedure for solving the problems to create the tokens was designed to become incrementally more difficult. That complicated and fast-changing process for creating value in the market may lead to a repeat of what happened with bitcoin, which also must be mined using increasingly sophisticated computing power. During a boom that started in 2013, the puzzles required to mine that currency soon outran the capabilities of graphics chips. That required the use of specialized semiconductors -- application specific integrated circuits, or ASICs -- designed for the purpose of mining bitcoin only. That meant that the flood of graphics chips initially sold to mine bitcoin was dumped back into the second-hand market once they were no longer useful for that task, causing a glut -- which hurt pricing and sales of new cards. “My strong belief is that all of these will be solved by ASICs in the end,” said Matt Ramsey, an analyst for Canaccord Genuity. “I don’t think it’s even remotely strategic to either company.” Some analysts say this time is different, arguing that the ethereum algorithm was written in a way that disadvantages ASICs, forcing miners to stick with graphics chips. Others counter that it’s just a matter of time before someone designs the right ASIC. Within the ethereum community, there’s also a movement to change the algorithm from its current format to curb the associated energy consumption. Running graphics cards -- which can draw as much power as a small tube TV -- is a suck on energy resources, particularly when those resources aren’t being used for a productive purpose. A shift to a system that doesn’t require mining would remove the need for committing computing resources, and therefore graphics chips, to solving the puzzles. The right hedge for graphics-chipmakers may already be out there. Computer-card manufacturers, including Asustek Computer Inc., which buy chips from Nvidia and AMD, are making products specifically for the cryptocurrency-mining market. Crucially, they’re leaving off all or most of the video connections from the finished products, meaning that even if the cryptocurrency market is soon mined out, the cards will be no use to gamers and therefore less likely to cause a glut by flooding the resale market. Asustek, one of the largest contract manufacturers of computers, offers two cards for the market. One doesn’t have any ability to connect with a display and the other only has a digital video interface port, or DVI, a connection technology that debuted in 1999 and was superseded about a decade ago making it useless to gamers who crave realism. Nvidia declined to comment on the cryptocurrency market opportunity. AMD said it’s sticking to its focus on gamers. “The gaming market remains our priority,” the company said in an emailed statement, repeating what it said earlier this quarter. “We are seeing solid demand for our Polaris-based offerings in the gaming and newly resurgent cryptocurrency-mining markets based on the strong performance we are delivering.”"

His London-based Revolut Ltd. raised the money in a round that included Balderton Capital and Ribbit Capital, according to a statement on Wednesday. Storonsky, 32, will use the funds to expand in Asia and North America, and let customers hold cryptocurrency. He also plans to gather $5 million in crowdfunding from consumers on Seedrs later this month. Revolut, which Russian-born Storonsky founded two years ago with former Deutsche Bank AG technology developer Vlad Yatsenko, makes money from fees on ATM withdrawals and takes a cut from merchant charges on payments in shops. As early as next week, it plans to let customers hold, exchange, spend and transfer virtual currencies such as bitcoin, litecoin and ethereum for free, profiting from the price differences between buyers and sellers as opposed to charging commission. “Adding cryptocurrencies and the ability to buy and sell them is a big step forward for a financial organization,” Storonsky, who used to trade equity derivatives, said in an interview. “Big banks are looking at us and seeing what we’re doing, for future things they want to add to their product pipeline, but they’re very slow.” For more on digital startups challenging European lenders, click here The cryptocurrency sector has lost about a third of its market value since peaking in early June, pushing it into what traditional equity market analysts label as a bear market. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, is down about 20 percent from its peak of $3,000, reached June 12. Smaller rivals such as ethereum are getting hit even harder. Storonsky is among former bankers such as ex-JPMorgan Chase & Co. executive Blythe Masters and erstwhile Barclays Plc Chief Executive Officer Antony Jenkins who are taking advantage of new technology to win customers in an industry dominated by their old employers. Although most fintech firms have yet to achieve significant scale and profit, the startups as a whole are threatening to upend banks handicapped by creaky computer systems. Revolut, which currently employs 140 people in London, Krakow and Moscow, plans to open offices in New York and Singapore and hire about 20 more staff, according to Storonsky. The Asia and North American growth plan will come “in parallel to expanding in Europe. These are big markets, there’s huge demand for our products,” he said. “We’ve got waiting lists and now is the time to enter.”"

Netflix's stunningly good quarterly earnings were built on a subscriber boom that not only surpassed analyst forecasts but made the company's international audience bigger than its domestic one for the first time. Shares jumped about 10 percent in after hours trading. The company will reach at least 20 percent of broadband households in five of its largest markets outside the U.S. by the end of the year, according to Instinet. Elsewhere in web-land, Microsoft Corp. and Google pleaded with U.S. regulators to preserve strong net neutrality rules, while AT&T Inc. and Comcast Corp. backed weakened oversight.  Credit Suisse told employees it will focus on  businesses that generate higher returns in its next strategic plan, signaling the era of cost-cutting and job dismissals may draw to a close. The Swiss-based bank  is midway through a three-year overhaul reorganizing operations around wealth management and emerging markets.  Meanwhile, storied buyout firm KKR prepared for the day that the founders referenced in its name  are no longer at the helm. Scott Nuttall and Joe Bae, two veteran executives in their 40s, were elevated to be co-presidents and co-chief operating officers, responsible for day-to-day operations.  Copper surged to a four-month high to lead a rally in base metals after China reported GDP grew faster than expected in the second quarter. The data came just after the Communist Party’s People’s Daily newspaper warned of potential ``gray rhinos'' -- highly probable, high-impact threats people should see coming, but often don’t. That may signal that the deleveraging campaign will continue, and that's probably bad news for the world's worst stocks --  the ChiNext index of small-cap shares.  China also is waving a rusty rag at U.S. bulls, boosting steel output to a record just as the Trump administration weighs steps to cut imports. And elsewhere in the world of commodity giants, Elliott Management Corp., the activist hedge fund run by billionaire Paul Singer, is planning to woo retail investors in BHP Billiton Ltd. as it pushes for a change of strategy at the world’s biggest mining company. BlackRock Inc. CEO Laurence D. Fink says the U.S. is growing more slowly than expected and faces ""dark clouds.''  He fretted about whether the White House can quickly pass key reforms. There was some gloom in the asset manager's earnings too, with a record $74 billion in ETF inflows overshadowed at least partly by revenue that failed to beat estimates. In general, Americans are feeling better about their jobs, their fortunes, their economy. That's the outcome from a Bloomberg national poll, one that also shows they aren't all that happy with their president -- just 40 percent of Americans approve of the job Donald Trump is doing in the White House. Another concern on the horizon is the new subprime boom -- this time in autos.  Japan is eyeing a return to the glory days by wooing the Saudis to try and get the world's biggest IPO. Members of Saudi Arabia’s royal family visited Japan last September and again in March, and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was among those trying to make sure at least one message got through: Please list Saudi Aramco in Tokyo. This is what's caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-12/bitcoin-acceptance-among-retailers-is-low-and-getting-lower,"Retailers were already skeptical about letting customers pay with bitcoin before the cryptocurrency’s price underwent an astronomical rally this year. That rapid surge hasn’t made them any more accepting. In fact, it may have done the opposite. Bitcoin is accepted at just three of the top 500 online merchants tracked by the e-commerce news and analytics publication Internet Retailer, down from five last year, Morgan Stanley payments analyst James Faucette wrote Wednesday in a report, highlighting the ""striking"" discrepancy between virtually no merchant acceptance and bitcoin’s recent gains. ""Bitcoin owners are reluctant to use the cryptocurrency given its rate of appreciation, more evidence that bitcoin is more asset than currency,"" Faucette said. ""Way easier to trade speculatively than convince new merchants to accept the cryptocurrency."" The hesitance among retailers may also be linked to bitcoin’s scaling challenges, as transactions become slower and more costly, he added. The consumer, rather than the retailer, bears that cost, which can vary depending on how the transaction in conducted. Internet Retailer’s 2017 top 500 list, which is based on online sales, is led by Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc. and Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Morgan Stanley, which based its usage analysis on the information, didn’t say which companies are using bitcoin.  Some cryptocurrency users no longer see the point in using bitcoin for small purchases given increased transaction fees, Atlantic Financial founder Bruce Fenton said in an interview last month. Read: Bitcoin Is Digital Gold. But Will You Buy a Sandwich With It? ""There’s a problem with the fees being so high -- it does price out certain things,"" said Fenton, who is a board member at the Bitcoin Foundation. ""There are some micro transaction uses cases -- a cup of coffee is the big analogy everybody uses -- that are being sort of priced out just because bitcoin is going up so much."" Overstock.com Inc. board member Jonathan Johnson said in May that the number of bitcoin transactions on the discount retail website had actually tripled since the company introduced the cryptocurrency as a payment method in 2014. Overstock brings in ""as much as $5 million per year"" from bitcoin, said Johnson, who is also the president of Overstock’s blockchain subsidiary."
2017-07-18T13:32:13.279Z,"Liquidity, Bankruptcy and Paperwork","Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-18/liquidity-bankruptcy-and-paperwork,"People are worried about bond market liquidity. If you are professionally worried about bond market liquidity, why not do something about it? Bond managers complain that banks are less willing to use their own capital to buy and sell bonds, which means that there is no one to buy when everyone else is selling or sell when everyone else is buying. So why shouldn't the bond managers themselves pick up the slack? After all, the banks have historically made a lot of money in the bond-dealing business. If they're getting out of it, shouldn't someone else get in? Obviously being a long-term bond investor is a different business from being a market maker, but you can tinker at the edges. If you run a giant bond portfolio, you will mostly buy bonds that you like and hold them for a long time, but you might occasionally step in to buy bonds because others are selling and they look like a bargain. Or you might even partner up with dealers to provide liquidity: If dealers have stopped buying bonds from customers themselves, and now mostly call up other customers to find a buyer, why not try to be the customer who gets those calls?  Anyway here is a fun paper from Amber Anand of Syracuse and Chotibhak Jotikasthira and Kumar Venkataraman of Southern Methodist University, called ""Do Buy-Side Institutions Supply Liquidity in Bond Markets? Evidence from Mutual Funds"": There is a classic model of how dealers function, in which when prices are going down, they buy bonds from flighty liquidity-seeking investors and sell them to more stable value investors. (And vice versa when prices are going up.) The dealer provides immediate liquidity for the flighty investors, and cushions a little against small price moves, but the dealer is not the ultimate source of liquidity: It just moves the bonds from the flighty investors to the value investors. The value investors are the deep sources of liquidity, the people who buy when everyone is selling, the people who cushion against catastrophic and irrational price moves.  It is a noble service that they provide, and they get paid for it: Liquidity-supplying funds tend to perform better than liquidity-taking funds, and they especially perform better in periods where liquidity is stressed. (""LS_score"" is the authors' measurement how liquidity-supplying a fund is; a higher LS_score means that the fund provides liquidity by absorbing dealer inventory.) This makes sense in a payment-for-liquidity-services model: The liquidity-supplying funds provide a valuable service, and the more valuable the service is, the more they get paid. It also makes sense in a simple value-investing model: The liquidity-supplying funds are greedy when everyone else is fearful, and the more fearful everyone else is, the more bargains they can pick up.  Also, here is how the authors characterize the liquidity-supplying funds:  Buy better bonds, keep plenty of dry powder, and make sure that you don't rely on flighty investors yourself, and you can benefit from the lack of liquidity by providing it yourself. Sovereign bankruptcy. A well-known problem in sovereign debt is that there is no bankruptcy regime. If a country has unsustainable debt, it can go to its creditors and ask them to restructure their debt, and many of them might agree. But if others don't, you can't force them; the only way to bind every holder to a restructuring is to get every holder to agree. And so you get situations like Argentina's long-running dispute with Elliott Management and other holdout creditors, who refused to participate in Argentina's restructuring and ended up holding out for tons more money, keeping Argentina out of the international debt markets for years along the way. People have proposed various solutions to this problem, with a popular one being to add collective action clauses into sovereign bonds: The bond documents might say ""if two-thirds of bondholders vote for a restructuring, then that restructuring will bind everyone."" (It's more complicated than that, with rules governing voting by multiple classes of bonds, and two-thirds isn't necessarily the right magic number, but that's the basic idea.) But this only really works for future bonds: You have to put the collective action clause in the bond document before you sell the bond, so this doesn't help already-outstanding bonds without the CACs.  That wouldn't matter in bankruptcy law: If a company issues a bond that doesn't contain any collective-action restructuring procedures, and then it can't pay, then it can file for bankruptcy, and bankruptcy law is basically just a series of provisions letting votes of creditors (and decisions of a judge) decide how to restructure the company's bonds. The collective action clauses are in the law, not the contract. But again there is no sovereign bankruptcy regime. But there could be. It doesn't even really need to be an international sovereign bankruptcy court: New York and England could just adopt collective-action provisions for sovereign bonds, and that would more or less do it. Most sovereign bonds are issued either under the law of their own countries -- which those countries could change to allow restructuring whenever they feel like it -- or under the law of New York or England; if those jurisdictions allowed restructuring by creditor vote, then that would cover a lot of bonds. That's the gist of this blog post and related paper by Steven Schwarcz of Duke University School of Law, ""Sovereign Debt Restructuring and English Governing Law,"" who lays out a model law for sovereign debt restructuring and suggests that England (and, elsewhere, New York) adopt that model law and apply it to existing bonds. Amusingly, a key risk is human rights law: It would be strange if a ""vulture"" hedge fund could demand additional money from an impoverished country as a matter of human rights. Student loan robosigning. Here is a story about how ""one of the nation’s largest owners of private student loans, the National Collegiate Student Loan Trusts ... is struggling to prove in court that it has the legal paperwork showing ownership of its loans."" Loans are originated by banks and sold to investors, the paperwork is complicated, it's a volume business, corners are cut, one thing leads to another, and you end up going to court to collect delinquent loans and then realizing that you can't prove that you actually own the loan. There are two sets of losers here: The investors who own the loans but can't get paid because they've messed up the documents, and the borrowers who are sometimes sued incorrectly because the trust really doesn't own the loan. And in theory there is a third, more remote, set of losers: If the investors can't get their money back when borrowers default, they will charge higher interest rates to future borrowers. This all seems bad, and it would be nice if someone would fix it. Maybe it's a good use case for the blockchain, ha ha ha. Or just, like, you could have a national database of these loans, set up by a consortium of banks and investors, with some trusted administrator to make sure that the paperwork was processed in an efficient, accessible, electronic way. Instead of keeping lots of photocopies of lots of documents, and maybe losing them, have everything in a secure but usable electronic form. But that is not how traditional American consumer-loan documents, or courts, work: You sign a promissory note, it goes in a file, someone pulls it out of the file and points to your signature, it's a whole 19th-century dance. You saw this back in the mortgage robosigning cases: Banks set up a system called MERS to electronically transfer loan entitlements, instead of relying on the antique system of going down to the county courthouse and recording a mortgage transfer. And people -- and courts -- worried that that was an end run around the traditional system. Efficient electronic transfers of entitlements overseen by a consortium of banks work great for the stock market, but they are viewed with some suspicion in consumer lending. There is this sense that the arcane old practices -- with lots of complicated paperwork to fill out, and lots of ways to accidentally mess up -- ought to be, at least, held against lenders: Lenders ought to have to suffer through the complicated paperwork just like the rest of us, and if they mess up the paperwork they shouldn't be able to collect the loans. A better solution would be to replace the bad complicated paperwork with simple clear electronic entitlements, and then let the lenders collect on the loans that they actually own (but not others). But there is this sense in America in 2017 that everything should be awful and difficult and inscrutable, but with occasional random lotteries to escape the awfulness. Student debt levels are crushing, and proving student loan ownership is impossible, but hey: Every so often a borrower will get a free education because her lender messed up the paperwork! That feel-good -- or feel-bad-but-with-a-windfall-at-the-end -- story seems to justify a lot of badness. People are worried about overfitting. Well, it comes up a lot, and might make a good recurring section: One of my favorite debates in quantitative investing involves a basic obvious way to avoid overfitting: Nothing could be more sensible! And yet many famous successful quantitative investors seem to flout this rule, notably Renaissance Technologies, which is fine with weird rules: And as neural networks and deep learning and other buzzwords creep into computer-driven investing, this problem will get more acute: If your neural network can't explain its trading rules to you, will you still trade on them? If so, what is your economic-behavioral justification? If not, why did you program the neural network in the first place? Overfitting is partly a statistical problem, about how we can extrapolate rules from data, but it is also a deep worry about whether the world is understandable, whether it is subject to rules, and whether those rules are comprehensible to humans. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Ah: I would say ""this seems like the logical conclusion of the ICO craze,"" but really we are very early in the ICO craze, and also it's only $7 million. The logical conclusion of the ICO craze will be so much bigger and dumber. But we should take this as a learning experience. What about an ICO where the inevitable theft by hackers is right there in the white paper?  Of course the even simpler solution is to do an ICO without offering tokens at all: Investors give you money, and you give them nothing, cutting out the middleman (the hackers) and just taking the money directly. Elsewhere here is Kadhim Shubber on the block.one ICO: People are worried about unicorns. Hampton Creek Inc., the Mayo Unicorn, has had to say goodbye to a few members of its board of directors recently, specifically all of them, except its chief executive officer, Josh Tetrick, who ""is now the only remaining board member."" So that's weird! To lose one board member may be regarded as normal turnover, but to lose ... five? ... looks like carelessness. But there's an explanation: I must say I like this as a general-purpose approach to bad news: Every time you lose something, you can concentrate more on what you have left. ""Sure our CEO left, but now his deputies feel empowered."" ""We lost a lot of money last quarter, but now we can focus even more on the money we still have."" But, yes, getting rid of your board of directors is one way to give more power to your staff. It eliminates a layer of management: Instead of ultimately answering to a board of directors that represents the investors in the company, the staff just answers to ... itself? (I mean, it answers to the CEO, who is also the board, but who is in a crucial sense ""staff,"" a member of the team.) ""We will advise Josh and the team on strategies across all areas of its business moving forward,"" said the departing board members, collectively, for some reason. They just won't be in charge any more.  It is a baffling story, one that may or may not have something to do with Hampton Creek's recent decision to fire three managers ""for attempting to change our company’s corporate governance, which in the process would have stripped our employees of the autonomy to direct our long-term mission."" But we have talked a lot about the shifting balance of power between entrepreneurs and investors, in which companies like Snap Inc. can now go public without giving shareholders any voting rights. I wonder if this weird story is a harbinger of the future: Why do private companies need boards of directors, anyway? As powerless advisers? Or as representatives of the owners, who ultimately have the power to fire the entrepreneur-CEO and shape the direction of the company in order to protect those owners' investments? That is the normal way of looking at the board, but I wonder if it is becoming out of date. Things happen. Goldman’s Traders Turn In Worst First Half of Blankfein’s Reign. (Earnings release.)

2017-07-10T21:00:00.000Z,Bitcoin Is Having a Civil War Right as It Enters a Critical Month,"Lulu Yilun Chen
         & Yuji Nakamura
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/bitcoin-risks-splintering-as-civil-war-enters-critical-month,"It’s time for bitcoin traders to batten down the hatches. The notoriously volatile cryptocurrency, whose 150 percent surge this year has captivated everyone from Wall Street bankers to Chinese grandmothers, could be headed for one of its most turbulent stretches yet. Blame the bitcoin civil war. After two years of largely behind-the-scenes bickering, rival factions of computer whizzes who play key roles in bitcoin’s upkeep are poised to adopt two competing software updates at the end of the month. That has raised the possibility that bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the $41 billion market. While both sides have big incentives to reach a consensus, bitcoin’s lack of a central authority has made compromise difficult. Even professional traders who’ve followed the dispute’s twists and turns aren’t sure how it will all pan out. Their advice: brace for volatility and be ready to act fast once a clear outcome emerges. QuickTake All About Bitcoin “It’s a high-stakes game of chicken,” said Arthur Hayes, a former market maker at Citigroup Inc. who now runs BitMEX, a bitcoin derivatives venue in Hong Kong. “If you’re a trader, there’s a lot of uncertainty as to what happens. Once there’s a definitive signal about what will be done, the price could move very quickly.” (Detailed summary of key dates and potential outcomes at bottom.) Behind the conflict is an ideological split about bitcoin’s rightful identity. The community has bitterly argued whether the cryptocurrency should evolve to appeal to mainstream corporations and become more attractive to traditional capital, or fortify its position as a libertarian beacon; whether it should act more as an asset like gold, or as a payment system. The seeds of the debate were planted years ago: To protect from cyber attacks, bitcoin by design caps the amount of information on its network, called the blockchain. That puts a ceiling on how many transactions it can process -- the so-called block size limit -- just as the currency’s growing popularity is boosting activity. As a result, transaction times and processing fees have soared to record levels this year, curtailing bitcoin’s ability to process payments with the same efficiency as services like Visa Inc. To address this problem, two main schools of thought emerged. On one side are miners, who deploy costly computers to verify transactions and act as the backbone of the blockchain. They’re proposing a straightforward increase to the block size limit. On the other is Core, a group of developers instrumental in upholding bitcoin’s bug-proof software. They insist that to ease blockchain’s traffic jam, some of its data must be managed outside the main network. They claim that not only would it reduce congestion, but also allow other projects including smart contracts to be built on top of bitcoin. But moving data off the blockchain effectively diminishes the influence of miners, the majority of whom are based in China and who have invested millions on giant server farms. Not surprisingly, Core’s proposal, called SegWit, has garnered resistance from miners, the most vocal being Wu Jihan, co-founder of the world’s largest mining organization Antpool. “SegWit is itself a great technology, but the reason it hasn’t taken off is because its interest doesn’t align with miners,” Wu said. Still, after previous counter-proposals championed by Wu fell through, miners last month agreed to compromise and support SegWit, in exchange for increasing the block size. Wu says the plan will alleviate short-to-medium term congestion and give Core enough time to flesh out a long-term solution. That proposal is what is known as SegWit2x, which implements SegWit and doubles the block size limit. “You can think of the SegWit2x proposal as an olive branch,” said Wu. Support for SegWit2x has reached levels unseen for previous solutions. About 85 percent of miners have signaled they are willing to run the software once it’s released on July 21, and some of bitcoin’s largest companies have also jumped on board. The unprecedented level of endorsement is partly prompted by anxiety of bitcoin losing its dominant status to ethereum, a newer cryptocurrency whose popularity has soared thanks to its ability to run smart contracts and its more corporate-friendly approach. Still, hardliners say that after more than two years of bitter arguments, a split would let people part ways to explore different visions, even if prices crash. Bitcoin dropped for a fourth day on Tuesday, declining 1.9 percent as of 7:49 a.m. in New York, to its lowest level since June 15. The cryptocurrency is down 22 percent from a record high in early June. Some of Core supporters are pushing a separate agenda called UASF (user activated soft fork). Starting from Aug. 1, it will reject transactions not compliant with SegWit. If a majority of miners do not adopt SegWit by then, two versions of bitcoin would come into existence, triggering a currency split. “It’s moderates versus extremists,” said Atlanta-based Stephen Pair, chief executive officer of BitPay, one of the world’s largest bitcoin wallets. “It depends on how much a person values the majority of people staying on one chain at least for a little while longer, versus splitting and allowing each pursuing their own vision for scaling.” Many Core developers continue to reject SegWit2x because they see its development and implementation as being too rushed, which they say could undermine the software underpinning bitcoin. “To suggest a hard fork happen significantly faster than even the most minor of changes in recent history is irresponsible and dangerous,” said Matt Corallo, a Core contributor and former co-founder of Blockstream, which is among companies that stand to benefit from SegWit. Below is an outline of the main events that could unify or divide bitcoin:"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2017-07-14/india-said-to-mull-monitoring-digital-currencies-to-track-crime,"India is considering tracking digital currencies like bitcoin through the central bank and capital markets regulator along with intelligence agencies to monitor money laundering and terrorist financing, people with the knowledge of the matter said. A federal government panel is examining options such as banning, regulating or limited intervention for virtual currencies in India, an area that’s currently neither regulated nor recognized by the government, said the people who asked not to be identified as the discussions are not public. Cryptocurrencies like bitcoin have attracted the attention of the authorities due to the exponential rise in their prices and market size. They’ve sparked concerns of money laundering, terrorist financing and drug trafficking.  Read more: Cryptocurrency Boom Turns Into Bust as Skepticism Rises According to government estimates, the economic value of one bitcoin is worth as much as 60 grams of gold, which closed at 27,837 rupees ($432) per 10 grams on July 13. With a weekly turnover of 60 million to 100 million rupees, bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, has gained a firm foothold in India. Digital currencies are worth around $90 billion, down from a market capitalization of $115 billion on June 14, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. The panel discussed the possibility of asking India’s central bank, the Securities and Exchange Board, the revenue department and Financial Intelligence Unit to develop infrastructure for observing transactions in virtual currencies, the people said. Finance Ministry spokesman DS Malik declined to comment on the discussions. ""It is in the best interest of the industry to self-regulate with the oversight of the government,"" Vaibhav Parikh, a partner in law firm Nishith Desai Associates, said. The law firm has been appointed by the Digital Asset and Blockchain Foundation of India, formed by Indian bitcoin startups like SearchTrade, Zebpay, Unocoin, to develop regulations for the industry. ""Government is worried about usage of digital currencies by criminals, money laundering and protection of customers. It will help if industry self-regulates.""

While Japan has legitimized virtual digital currencies, the U.K., the U.S. and Australia classify it as property that attracts capital-gains tax. China considers digital currencies as a virtual commodity. However, the Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly warned users, holders and traders of virtual currencies against the potential risks.  Politicians have also issued cautions. Kirit Somaiya, a member of Parliament from the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party and a vocal critic of bitcoin, has dubbed the virtual currency ""illegal"". Responding to the increasing concern, the finance ministry in April formed the inter-ministerial panel to examine virtual currencies -- it is expected to report by the end of this month. According to the deliberations, the panel believes that banning digital coins will make transactions go underground, while regulating it would provide legitimacy to digital currency. Limited intervention, however, will reiterate that cryptocurrencies are not a recognized medium of exchange and send a message that dealers trade in such currencies at their own peril given their volatility, according to a government document seen by Bloomberg News."

2017-07-13T16:24:27.564Z,An Online Black Market Vanishes. What Took So Long?,"Elaine Ou
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-13/an-online-black-market-vanishes-what-took-so-long,"Last Tuesday, the darknet market known as AlphaBay vanished without a trace. With more than 100,000 users and an estimated $800,000 in daily transactions, it was the largest market in the underground web. AlphaBay administrators initially appeared on Reddit to assure users that the site was undergoing routine maintenance, but with each passing day, the story seemed less and less plausible. Now that more than a week has elapsed, it looks like AlphaBay may have pulled the ultimate exit scam. Darknet markets are hidden websites accessible through browsers such as Tor, which route encrypted communications through multiple machines to mask the user’s location. Each site hosts a unique selection of vendors peddling illicit goods such as drugs, weapons and stolen data. Darknet participants are not exactly beacons of trust, so sites like AlphaBay offer an escrow service to hold bitcoin payments until a buyer confirms receipt of a delivery. Market operators typically charge a 5-10 percent fee per transaction. The escrow service creates a separate risk to the vendors: The larger the marketplace, the greater the amount of bitcoin in custody at any given time. A sizable market might be holding several million dollars' worth of bitcoin in escrow, and vendors have to trust the site administrators not to shut it all down and run off with the deposits -- a move known as an exit scam. Two years ago, a market called Evolution exited with an estimated $12 million worth of bitcoin. It’s not a question of whether exit scams will occur; rather, it’s a question of when. The anonymous nature of these sites means that participants have no recourse in the event of wrongdoing. Market operators have to calculate the optimal time for retirement, balancing their profits against the risk of a hack or police raid. Underground markets tend to have a short lifespan. Exit scams are as old as the warehousing profession. In the 1640s, the outbreak of the English Civil War drew merchants’ apprentices to join the army, leaving merchants with no one to safeguard their surplus cash. The merchants turned to private goldsmiths, who were accustomed to safekeeping precious metals. Initially, there were reports of the goldsmiths packing up and skipping town, but the enterprising goldsmiths eventually discovered that profits could be maximized not by going on the lam, but by sticking around and issuing warehouse receipts in excess of the gold on hand. And thus fractional reserve banking was born.
            
                
                1
            
         The remarkable thing about AlphaBay is not its recent disappearance, but the fact that it apparently managed to grow so large without succumbing to insider theft. This can be attributed, in part, to its unique business model. Earlier this year, a site administrator explained that AlphaBay was not actually in the business of e-commerce: So AlphaBay is really a deposit bank! Whereas my credit union attracts customers with offers of 0.01 percent interest and a free pen, AlphaBay offers access to illegal drugs. It’s unclear how they manage to simultaneously invest customer demand deposits while maintaining a full reserve -- the numerous complaints of suspended withdrawals suggest that they don’t. Bitcoin enthusiasts tend to take a dim view of fractional reserve banking. Past situations involving an overissue of bitcoin-based debt instruments resulted in massive implosions, most notably the collapse of Mt. Gox. We may never learn the true fate of AlphaBay; the underground web is littered with black markets that disappeared with no further explanation. But it’s surely a testament to Bitcoin’s price stability that darknet markets have transitioned to the business of banking.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-14/this-is-how-bad-it-s-getting-for-wall-street-traders,"1) There’s Little Happening Traders can play Nintendo and head off to Massachusetts for an afternoon of golf. Or while away the afternoons swiping on Tinder. Traders at some of Wall Street’s biggest banks have time on their hands, because not enough is happening on the global stage to persuade investors to get involved, Bloomberg’s Laura J. Keller reports. The Federal Reserve is holding steady on its plan for interest rates, President Donald Trump’s agenda appears to be stalled, and there hasn’t been a big surprise event like the Brexit vote to provide volatility. “As a salesman or trader, it does get to the stage where you go, ‘Christ, what am I going to do for the rest of the day?’” said Chris Wheeler, a bank analyst at Atlantic Equities. That’s bad for revenue at the big banks, which start reporting earnings Friday.  2) Bitcoin Could Be Nearing a Total Meltdown Bitcoin believers have said the cryptocurrency could be the way we all pay for things in the future, a monetary esperanto that crosses borders, protects against fraud, and transforms the financial industry. But there’s a civil war brewing, Bloomberg’s Lulu Yilun Chen and Yuji Nakamura report: “Rival factions of computer whizzes who play key roles in bitcoin’s upkeep are poised to adopt two competing software updates at the end of the month. That has raised the possibility that bitcoin will split in two, an unprecedented event that would send shockwaves through the $41 billion market.” In general, digital currencies have lost a third of their market value since early June’s peak. 3) There’s a New Type of Airline Rewards Program  United Airlines Inc. this week introduced a program to try to wring more money out of every seat, without causing more public-relations debacles. In the days before takeoff, United will reach out to passengers scheduled to travel on a packed flight and offer to move them to one at a less popular time in exchange for rewards, such as a $250 voucher. United can then sell those tickets to travelers willing to pay more for last-minute bookings—such as business travelers. We can all agree this is far better than the alternative. 4) A Cover-Up Always Makes It Worse Would these meetings with Russians be a big deal if people in the Trump orbit were up front about them? Each revelation of yet another undisclosed meeting or phone call with someone from Russia—diplomats, lawyers, bankers—provides an opportunity to play highlight reels where senior members of the Trump administration deny any contact. The criticisms echo one of the bigger misgivings about the Clintons, that they were always perceived to be hiding something. 5) A Waiter’s Dream Customer: A Republican Man From New England Tipping can be stressful when traveling. But in America, it’s standard. Why? Because the federal minimum wage for waiters is only $2.13, and restaurants expect diners to help their servers afford rent. Still, cultural norms vary for tipping around the country. (In New York City, expect to get dirty looks if you don’t leave 20 percent at brunch.) But we can dive deeper: A new survey shows that men, Republicans and people from the Northeast leave an average 20 percent tip, while Democrats and southerners tend to leave 15 percent.  "

Sign up here. “This is obviously very high level and sensitive information but is part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr. Trump."" That was a portion of an email with the subject line ""Russia - Clinton - private and confidential"" that Donald Trump Jr. received last year from Rob Goldstone, a former British tabloid journalist and marketing executive who set up a meeting between the younger Trump and a Russian lawyer. “If it’s what you say I love it,"" Donald Trump Jr. responded. –Emily Banks Donald Trump Jr. was told Russia sought to hurt Clinton, according to the aforementioned emails, which he released on Twitter today. The president's son acknowledged that he was told before a meeting last year with a Russian lawyer that she had potentially damaging information on Hillary Clinton, and that information came from officials in Moscow as part of an effort to help his father’s presidential campaign. Jared Kushner and then-campaign manager Paul Manafort also attended that meeting. President Trump was sued for blocking Twitter users. The Knight First Amendment Institute, a nonprofit organization affiliated with Columbia University, alleges the president and high ranking members of the White House staff violate the Constitution by blocking Twitter users. The case seeks a court order that Trump stop the practice. The foundation argues the president’s account is “a public forum under the First Amendment” because of how he and his staff use it. A diplomat blacklisted by the EU is set to be Russia's new U.S. ambassador. Anatoly Antonov, a hard-line critic of U.S. foreign policy, is on track to succeed Sergey Kislyak later this year, according to three officials familiar with the planning.

2017-07-13T14:23:10.780Z,Initial Coin Offerings Seen Topping Early Stage Venture Funding,"Julie Verhage
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/initial-coin-offerings-seen-topping-early-stage-venture-funding,"While people talk about a bubble in funding for private startups, one might want to take a look at the surge in funding for cryptocurrencies first. According to William Mougayar, a Toronto-based venture adviser and investor, funding in initial coin offerings, a means of crowdfunding the release of a new cryptocurrency, has now exceeded that of early stage venture capital funding. “Ever since the Bancor and Gnosis ICOs kicked the door open on creativity and boldness in ICO campaigns, the appetite for ICOs has been steadily increasing,” Mougayar wrote in a posting on Startup Management. “I sensed that June was a pivotal month that may be setting the tone for the next months to come, so I spent a good part of the past several days trying to tally-up exactly how much was raised.” Based on his research, Mougayar said more than $560 million flowed into the space in June alone. For comparison, angel and seed stage investments only see roughly $550 million invested each month on average. A recent report from CB Insights and PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP shows that $8.7 billion flowed into Internet-related startups in the first half of 2017, and across all sectors roughly 50 percent of investment was in the seed and early stage firms, he said. So taking half of $8.7 billion, cutting it in half once again and then dividing by six to get a per month number gives you roughly $360 million, below the amount of ICO funding seen, Mougayar said. Investors in digital currencies have been experiencing more volatility than in traditional markets as of late. Digital coins are currently worth around $86 billion, down from a market capitalization of $100 billion last week and $115 billion on June 14, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, is down about 20 percent from its peak of $3,000, reached June 12. “Will this become a sustainable trend remains to be seen,” Mougayar wrote. “In early February, I predicted that 1,000 ICOs would raise $1 billion by the end of 2017. $1 billion sounded outrageous at that time, but we have already eclipsed it on a year-to-date basis,” he concluded."

         & Tim Culpan
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/ethereum-s-volatility-is-undermining-its-viability,"The price of ethereum dropped about 20 percent at the height of a selloff in cryptocurrencies this week. That's bad news. What's even worse is that it rebounded as much as 14 percent soon after. There's a word for this kind of fluctuation: volatility. Volatility is the enemy of viability for a currency that seeks to be widely accepted. The world lost its mind when the British pound plunged last year following the Brexit vote. Yet the size of the one-day drop was a mere 8 percent. That's a measure of what's considered abnormal in currency markets. The fact that cryptocurrency watchers tend to shrug when prices whiplash is a fundamental challenge to general adoption. An asset that rises and falls 20 percent in a day doesn't make for a good medium of exchange with which to buy coffee. Ethereum produced a headline-grabbing 24-fold return this year, with a daily standard deviation of 7.6 percent.   Behind the cryptocurrency's massive run-up and collapse over the past few months has been the advent of initial coin offerings. We've written before about the ICO phenomenon and how that may shake out. A few standouts have set increasingly higher fundraising records including Bancor, which closed on June 12 after drawing in $153 million. By early July, Tezos and Asia-based Block One raised $200 million and $185 million respectively within just five days  -- and both are still open to new investors.  But while we denominate this funding in U.S. dollars, those startups were actually paid in ethereum. And since the power company, the janitor and most lawyers don't accept ethereum, management has little choice but to convert some of it into fiat currency. Multiply this by the hundreds of ICOs that were launched in the past few months and suddenly you have buckets of cryptocurrency that need to be sold. The four large ICOs alone raised more than $500 million in a matter of weeks, while daily trading of ethereum averages less than $350 million this year. Imagine the selling pressure. A lot was exchanged into U.S. dollars, but the friction and costs of converting into fiat mean much was instead swapped for bitcoin. This is still the dominant digital currency, with far greater liquidity, which has helped keep bitcoin relatively stable. That explains the decline. But what about the rebound? Unlike bitcoin, ethereum was founded to build smart-contract functionality into its blockchain. That's a key reason why the currency has been at the heart of all of these ICOs -- because startups actually use the underlying digital ledger (technically: ether is the currency, ethereum is the blockchain) in their products and services. Those hoping ethereum will become a transactional currency shouldn't hold their breath, because there's mounting evidence that even bitcoin isn't enjoying the widespread adoption proponents had expected. Aiding ethereum are signs that the ICO trend isn't over yet, including talk of an impending mega-offering from publishing enterprise Press.One. To get in on this or any other ICO, investors will need to buy ethereum, which should drive prices back up. Magnifying that will be people who anticipate the renewed demand and buy ahead of the expected uptick -- we call them speculators. At the end of the fundraising cycle, though, that ethereum will once again need to be sold for cash. Forcing prices back down. Rinse and repeat. Eventually, something has to give. The ICO boom won't last forever. If ethereum's backers are lucky, this cooling of demand will lead to a drop in volatility. The ethereum market may even become boring and mundane. Take a look at the British pound last summer and you may realize that boring isn't so bad after all. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-13/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here It's Yellen's second day of congressional testimony, oil's recovery could be a long way off, and Theresa May presents her Repeal Bill. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen's first day of testimony to Congress saw the dollar fall against all of its Group-of-10 peers after her comments caused investors to lower their expectations on the pace of U.S. rate increases. Today she appears in front of the Senate Banking Committee from 9:30 a.m. Eastern Time, where she'll likely face more questions on financial industry regulation than on monetary policy. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for August delivery was trading at $45.23 as of 5:30 a.m. after the International Energy Agency signaled it was less confident that the global market for the commodity was rebalancing as anticipated. Oil bosses are concerned that it may now take until at least 2020 for prices to recover from the biggest downturn in a generation. Halliburton Co. is warning that current low prices are leading to investment spending cuts of about $2 trillion, which will see supply fall and prices spike by that year. Until then, OPEC member nations will continue to feel the pressure as low prices mean balancing national budgets is becoming very challenging.  British Prime Minister Theresa May will spend the first anniversary of her premiership trying to shore up support for landmark legislation which will take Britain out the EU. The vital Repeal Bill will transpose EU legislation into British law in order to maintain the status quo and to provide legal certainty through the Brexit process. On the European side, chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has again expressed frustration on the lack of clear positions from the British side, which he says is stopping negotiations from beginning in earnest.  Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index rose 0.7 percent, while shares in Japan were little changed as Yellen's apparent dovishness strengthened the yen. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.6 percent higher at 5:50 a.m. as yesterday's rally into the close continued to find support. S&P 500 futures were also pointing to further gains at the open.  At 8:30 a.m. weekly Initial Jobless Claims will be released, with expectations for a slight improvement to 245,000 for the period. At the same time, Producer Price Inflation for June will be released with analysts predicting  that prices stagnated in the month. At 1:00 p.m. Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard, who earlier this week sounded a note of caution on further U.S. interest rate increases, is due to speak. President Donald Trump is in Paris today.  This is what's caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-11/cryptocurrency-boom-turns-into-bear-market-as-skepticism-rises,"The cryptocurrency Cassandras are starting to look right. The sector has lost about a third of its market value since peaking in early June, pushing it into what traditional equity market analysts label as a bear market. Bitcoin, the largest of the digital currencies, is down about 20 percent from its peak of $3,000, reached June 12. Smaller rivals such as ethereum and ripple are getting hit even harder. “When when we look for signs of excess in the market, I look at bitcoin and to me that looks pretty scary,” Richard Turnill, global chief investment strategist at BlackRock Inc., said during a midyear outlook presentation in New York on Tuesday. Whether the virtual currencies were caught up in an asset-price bubble was debated as the market capitalization of the sector soared this year, raising skepticism from pundits including tech billionaire Mark Cuban. Backers such as Ripple Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse, whose money-transfer company is tied to the third-largest cryptocurrency by market value, said he isn’t convinced. ""I would be surprised if there was a major crash,"" Garlinghouse said in an interview at Bloomberg’s New York headquarters Monday. ""Could we see digital assets continue to double or triple or quadruple from where we are today? That wouldn’t surprise me at all."" Digital coins are currently worth around $80 billion, down from a market capitalization of $100 billion on Friday and $115 billion on June 14, according to data from Coinmarketcap.com. This week’s slump coincides with initial hearings in the trial of the former head of Mt. Gox, the bankrupt Japan-based bitcoin exchange that imploded in 2014 after losing hundreds of millions of dollars’ worth of bitcoin. Chief Executive Officer Mark Karpeles pleaded not guilty in Tokyo on Tuesday to charges of embezzlement and inflating corporate financial accounts.

2017-07-12T13:28:25.475Z,Revolving Doors and Robot Appraisers,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-12/revolving-doors-and-robot-appraisers,"Revolving doors. Why do banks hire former regulators? There is a popular view that they do it to reward the regulators for being nice to them: If regulators know that, after a few years of regulating, they can leave for a cushy job in the private sector, they are more likely to be lenient in their regulation. But this view is wrong. It is wrong as a description of what regulators do. We talked several years ago about a New York Fed report finding ""a positive association between the intensity of strict actions over time and across states and the net inflows into the regulatory sector"": Strict regulation increases the demand for ex-regulators in the private sector, so a purely self-interested regulator should want to regulate strictly in order to maximize her chances of getting paid later. It is apparently also wrong as a description of what banks do. Here (via Tyler Cowen) is a paper (free version here) by Sophie Shive and Margaret Forster of Notre Dame, who ""investigate the motivations and effects of financial firms' hiring of former U.S. financial regulatory employees"": ""The evidence we find is most consistent with the schooling hypothesis,"" they write: ""In the quarter after hire, market and balance sheet measures of firm risk decrease significantly and measures of risk management activity increase."" If a prudential regulator leaves to become a bank executive, she is likely to bring the mindset of a prudential regulator into banking -- not to bring the mindset of a banker into regulation. On the other hand, the revolving door, as the name implies, opens in both directions. Here's a profile of Randal Quarles, a former Treasury official who became a Carlyle Group dealmaker and who is now the nominee to be the Federal Reserve's vice chairman of supervision, where one assumes he will be light on the supervision: One story you could tell about the regulatory revolving door is that incentives probably matter less than acculturation. If you work as a regulator, you are surrounded by other regulators, and regulation is the cool thing to do, and you think regulatory thoughts. It might occur to you that you could make a lot more money one day by undermining regulations, but that is not a big part of your everyday thinking. And then when you leave your regulatory job for the private sector, you carry your regulatory thoughts with you, at least for a while. On the other hand, if you work in finance, you are surrounded by financiers, and ... optimizing ... for regulation is the cool thing to do, and you do that. And then when you leave your finance job for a regulator, you carry your finance-friendly thoughts with you, at least for a little while.  Elsewhere in Fed nominees. Here is a Politico story reporting that ""President Donald Trump is increasingly unlikely to nominate Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen next year for a second term,"" and that ""National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn is now the leading candidate to succeed Yellen as the world’s most important central banker."" That ... seems ... right? Like, Janet Yellen seems like a pretty good Fed chair, and Gary Cohn seems like a pretty good manager who is unusually competent and pragmatic for the Trump White House, but who is not particularly qualified to be a Fed chair, given that he is not an economist. They are perhaps the two senior people in government most qualified for their current roles, so of course they can't stay in those roles. Moving Cohn from the White House to the Fed would reduce the competence of both the Fed and the White House, which I have come to assume is the goal. Robot appraisers. There are financial markets where algorithms are taking over from humans. Stocks and currencies trade pretty much continuously, and there is a ton of data to analyze, and computers are better at crunching data than humans are, and crucially they are constantly being given new out-of-sample data to test their analysis on: If your stock-trading algorithm is wrong, it will lose money in the next minute, and you can turn it off. On the other hand, there are financial markets where it seems like algorithms will have a tougher time: Private equity firms, for instance, buy companies fairly infrequently, and data about private companies is often non-public and non-standardized, and it's hard to tell if your decision to buy a company was correct until many years have passed. So while quant firms are common in the stock market, no one is going to set up an automated algorithmic private equity firm any time soon. Still you have to expect automation to, as it were, move up the value chain, into less frequently traded and more opaque asset classes. Here is a fun article about the automation of real estate appraisal: As always, the counterargument is that there are some things that only a human can do, like go out and actually look at houses. But Zillow engineers are already ""mining the website’s trove of photos provided by real estate agents, looking for interior features that make one home more valuable than another,"" and ""trying to teach their algorithms to recognize the curb appeal—a mature tree casting shade over the front lawn, for example—that makes buyers ready to pay more."" And the robots can examine much more data than the humans can, and can form intuitions that the humans can't, because the humans are data-constrained: Human appraisers might have some sort of gut instinct about the valuation effect of flight noise, if they happen to do an appraisal when a plane is overhead. But the robots will know all the flight paths, and how flight paths correlate with value, and their gut instinct will be more reliable. Also: But that is also what human appraisers need! Why would a human appraiser's appraisal of a geodesic dome in the middle of Montana be an accurate guide to its future selling price? There is no innate human ability to recognize the value of real estate; that is not a skill that evolved in our ancestors on the savanna. Human real estate appraisers try to estimate the value of a house based on recent selling prices of similar houses. They are in the pattern recognition business. The argument for artificial intelligence in financial markets is basically that computers are better -- more rigorous, more able to use large amounts of data -- at recognizing patterns than humans are, and that in the long run pattern-recognition jobs will be automated. Elsewhere, here is Fabio Ciucci on artificial intelligence and machine learning: How's Martin Shkreli doing? When Martin Shkreli was first arrested for securities fraud, I was pretty impressed that he managed to take an initial investment of $700,000 down to $700 - a loss of 99.9 percent -- and then somehow make it back and pay off his investors with profits. ""If you're down 99.9 percent, it's hard to come back,"" I said, ""but it's reeeeeeally easy to lose that last 0.1 percent."" It turns out I underestimated him! It is fairly easy to turn $700,000 into $700, or $1.1 million into minus 33 cents (a loss of 100.00003 percent). It is harder to turn $700 into millions. But it is very, very difficult indeed to turn minus 33 cents into millions, as Shkreli more or less did. Negative 33 cents might be the very hardest amount of money to turn into positive millions. For instance, if you told me that someone had a fund with negative $100 million, I would say: That guy is going places! Having negative a lot of money gives you a decent chance of one day having positive a lot of money. But I suspect that no one had ever turned negative 33 cents into millions, until Shkreli did it. That is just not a lot of money, even in absolute-value terms. ""If you owe the bank $100, that's your problem; if you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem,"" but if you owe the bank 33 cents you are just not on the bank's radar.  Bank capital. Here is a good piece from Thomas Hale about the odd treatment of bank capital securities in the Banco Popular Espanol SA failure. In particular, he notes that Additional Tier 1 capital securities were meant to be ""going concern"" capital, that is, bonds that flip into equity when bank capital ratios fall, rather than only being written off when the bank actually fails. But in fact Popular's AT1s were wiped out when it failed, exactly the same as its Tier 2 capital securities, which are senior to the AT1s and are meant to be ""gone concern"" capital. Hale writes:  The problem is that bank failure is not usually about capital levels gradually falling over time, which could be solved by gradually flipping bonds into equity. Instead it is usually about liquidity -- about deposit runs -- and recapitalizing banks using AT1s can actually hurt liquidity: Elsewhere: ""Bank Rescues Leave Sweden Questioning Point of Post-Crisis Union."" People are worried that people aren't worried enough. ""Can't Complain About a Lack of Volatility Now,"" writes my Bloomberg Prophets colleague Robert Burgess, but sure you can! Yes, there was some excitement yesterday: ""The Dow Jones Industrial Average erased about 160 points in 20 minutes and volume in the most widely traded S&P 500 futures tripled as a gut check landed on traders just after 11 a.m. in New York Tuesday,"" in the form of Donald Trump Jr.'s weird Twitter confession. But the Dow closed up 0.55 points on the day -- up 0.0026 percent -- and the VIX volatility index actually fell, closing at 10.89. The market reacted to political news, then remembered that we're not doing that any more, and quickly un-reacted to the news. People are worried about unicorns. The biggest worry for unicorns this week comes from the most recent class of unicorn alumni, Snap Inc. and Blue Apron Holdings Inc., which ""have swiftly gone from two of the year’s most anticipated IPOs to poster children for companies whose rich private valuations haven’t withstood the scrutiny of public markets."" Snap fell below its $17 initial public offering price on Monday, and closed at $15.47 yesterday after an analyst at Morgan Stanley, the lead underwriter on the IPO, cut his price target from $28 to $16. (Oops!) Blue Apron, meanwhile, fell below its already-discounted $10 IPO price pretty much as soon as the greenshoe ran out, and closed yesterday at $7.14. Both companies are trading below their last private valuations, which is not encouraging for other unicorns: It is hard to draw too many conclusions from these data points: Each unicorn is a unique magical creature, and there's no certainty that the weak reception for these two is a bad sign for others. But the basic worry of ""people are worried about unicorns"" has always been that frothy private markets were funding technology companies at valuations that could not be justified in the public markets, and now we are starting to see sustained evidence that that might be right. So what will happen? Typically price bubbles are resolved through price: People realize that private markets are overvaluing companies, and so private-market valuations go down. But it is not quite so simple in the Enchanted Forest, where valuations don't update every day, and where people are emotionally invested in never having a down round. So the price bubble might be resolved through time: Rather than trading at a low price, you just wait, and hope to trade at a higher price (""grow into your valuation""). Obviously this plan doesn't work if the trend is permanently down, but they are all optimists, out in the Enchanted Forest. The other big unicorn worry is of course gender discrimination: Also apparently there's a deer-unicorn in Italy. Things happen. Paul Singer Could Finally Get Warren Buffett to Punch Back.

Who wants to buy a debt-ridden, loss-making airline? Narendra Modi's cabinet wants to offload state carrier Air India — but selling even a minority stake in the 85-year-old company isn't going to be easy. For a start, there's about $8 billion of debt on its balance sheet. Then there are its five subsidiary companies to think about, not to mention its shrinking market share and a combined workforce of 27,000 backed by unions with a history of grounding the airline over work demands. But Air India isn't without its appeal for the right buyer. Trump dealt a blunt blow by his own son's emails. The U.S. president's credibility was severely dented after his son released emails that directly contradict months of assertions that investigations of possible campaign collusion with Russia were nothing more than a partisan “witch hunt.” The president now faces emboldened Democrats in Congress and Republican lawmakers who may be even more likely to shy away from taking political risks on his behalf. Cryptocurrencies are getting crushed. Bitcoin has lost 20 percent of its market value since mid-June, but smaller digital currencies such as ethereum and ripple have been hit even harder. And the turbulence may be far from over, with rival bitcoin enthusiasts set to adopt two competing software updates at the end of July. That said, volatility is nothing new for buyers of virtual currencies, and the jury's still out on where the market will go next. Singapore's top performing IPO this year surged 158 percent.  After staging concerts in Singapore for the past two decades, Unusual is taking its entertainment on the road. The company, which has brought Mariah Carey and the Foo Fighters to Asia and will host Justin Bieber’s in Singapore later this year, wants to double the number of shows it organizes, expanding into China's second-tier cities and capitals across Southeast Asia. Australians are divided over their economy like never before. Business confidence is powering along and conditions — a measure of hiring, sales and profits — hit a post-2008 crisis high. But consumer sentiment remains in the doldrums, with pessimists outnumbering optimists for an eighth-straight month, as heavily indebted households struggle with stagnant wages to make ends meet. Building a 'smart nation' in Singapore doesn't come cheap, for citizens or for the state. The Lion City boasts one of the best education systems in the world — a factor that helps it to attract expat talent — but it's also one of the most expensive, trailing only Hong Kong and the United Arab Emirates. Government spending on schooling has more than doubled since 2005, amid heavy emphasis on equipping students with skills for a digital economy.  Will Rupert Murdoch's Bel Air winery ever be more than a vanity project? Smack in the middle of a ritzy L.A. neighborhood, the media mogul's Moraga Estate makes $175 reds and $110 whites. But can the vineyard ever turn a profit? ""I think we can get there,"" Murdoch says.

If airlines aren't your thing, how about a 1,000-year-old French castle? With grounds designed by the royal gardener to Louis XIV, Château de la Barben has had a long and illustrious string of owners, but has only been on the market once in 500 years.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-11/indexing-boredom-and-butter,"Indexing, quants, etc. Here is an intriguing opinion article from Paul Woolley and Dimitri Vayanos arguing that ""Action must be taken to stop quants exploiting weakness."" The thesis is that quantitative funds rely on either value (buying underpriced stocks) or momentum (buying overpriced stocks and then selling them at even higher prices), and that in either case they need some sucker on the other side of the trade. And ""logic suggests that benchmarkers are the 'patsies' that fulfil this role"": Index funds and quasi-indexers are obliged ""to chase bubbles, overpaying for high-risk stocks they do not like and selling low-risk ones they do like."" The quant funds profit from exploiting these predictable behaviors by indexers: I like to consider myself a bit of a connoisseur of the arguments against index funds, but I had never seen quite this argument before. One argument against indexing that you sometimes see is that it makes life too difficult for value investors: As money pours into index funds, it constantly props up overvalued stocks and keeps prices divorced from fundamentals. You sometimes see the opposite argument -- that more indexing means less competition to spot value, making life easier for value investors -- but it is usually phrased as a good thing. But Woolley and Vayanos's argument is that indexing makes life too easy for value investors: Indexers buy stocks dumbly without regard for value, which makes it easy for value investors to profit, which leads to ""an unsavoury cocktail of asset mispricing, bubbles and crashes, secular over-pricing and the inversion of risk and return."" Of course, so what? ""The whole is a chronically unstable system and the very opposite of the picture of efficiency painted by standard finance theory,"" they write, but actually it sounds very much like the picture of efficiency painted by standard finance theory. It seems fairly standard to say that some people are wrong about stocks, and so prices become wrong, and so other people who are right about stocks step in to buy the underpriced stocks and sell the overpriced ones until prices become right again. ""Chronically unstable"" sounds like another way of saying ""self-stabilizing."" Elsewhere in blaming index funds, my Bloomberg View colleague Noah Smith has jumped into the ""should index funds be illegal"" debate. And elsewhere in blaming quant funds, oil traders ""say program trading is distorting the market, often causing shallow price drops to accelerate."" Also: ""Quant Funds That Chase Trends Are This Year's Biggest Losers."" I guess they are chasing the trend of losing money, har har har. It's boring. Here is a funny story about priorities. This is apparently bad:  I mean, sure, Tinder is a nihilistic horror, and so is golf, and maybe that guy's kids are bad at sports, but all in all that sounds nice. But of course bond traders are pursuing their hobbies and social and family lives because they don't have enough work to do, and not enough work translates into not enough revenue, and not enough revenue is bad. ""Analysts estimate the five largest firms will say their combined revenue from trading dropped 11 percent from a year earlier to $18.4 billion -- the smallest haul for a second quarter since 2012.""  But you know what would help a little? ""Traders need a major overhaul of U.S. regulations, a significant shift in fiscal or monetary policy, or some other surprise to trigger sustained investor action."" The actual nature of the surprise doesn't matter that much: Banks are in the moving business, not the storage business, and so anything that shakes things up and moves prices is helpful for revenue.  You can ... sort of ... see why ... people don't like Wall Street, right? The framing here is basically ""boy I hope there is a terrorist attack so I can spend less time with my children."" Butter. Ahahahaha Pablo Salame, the co-head of trading at Goldman Sachs Group Inc., is mad about losing market share, so now there are hats: Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman, and I enjoyed the picture that Bloomberg tweeted with this story, of a steak covered with a gigantic pat of herb butter. It is a nice metaphor for what I remember as being the Goldman approach: Goldman will make you a fancy thing, but you will pay for it. Orphan CDS! Ah yes: There have been enough stories like this, by now, that if you buy credit default swaps you should expect a little gamesmanship. But there is a natural limit on the gamesmanship here. If you are a hedge fund that has sold CDS on Matalan Plc, then you are at risk of having to pay out if Matalan defaults, and so it makes sense for you to offer this refinancing-and-orphaning plan that will render the CDS contracts worthless. But! If you do it by actually lending Matalan money, then you still have a risk of losing your money if Matalan defaults. You have transformed your synthetic Matalan exposure (CDS) into actual Matalan exposure (loans). It's not exactly a windfall profit for you; it's more just turning your financial exposure to Matalan into actual money for Matalan. And because there's no windfall, you can't necessarily offer especially attractive terms: ""Two of the people familiar with the trade said Matalan’s senior management were unlikely to accept the hedge funds’ gambit."" On the other hand, if it does work, nobody has much cause to complain: People who bought old Matalan bonds and hedged with CDS will get their old bonds paid off, which is what they wanted. People who didn't buy old Matalan bonds, and who bought CDS just for a naked bet against the credit, will lose out, but you can't really say that they're losing out unfairly. If you're betting that a company will default, one risk that you take is that its current lenders won't let it default, and will extend new financing to keep it alive. That's what's being proposed here, except that instead of Matalan's current actual lenders offering new financing, it's the current CDS writers. Information leakage. I don't know, what do you make of this: That's from a paper by Nitish Kumar, Kevin Mullally, Sugata Ray and Yuehua Tang, and I guess there is a bit of a genre recently of papers documenting information leakage from brokers to clients. (We've talked twice before about a paper by Marco Di Maggio, Francesco Franzoni, Amir Kermani and Carlo Sommavilla finding that brokers leak information about client trades to other clients.) The syndicated lending/prime brokerage link is a weird one, though. Those activities are far enough removed from each other that it's just sort of hard to imagine the prime-brokerage person sitting down with the syndicated-loan person over lunch and being like ""so got any loans coming up that I should tell my hedge-fund clients about?"" I don't know. But there is ""abnormal trading activity"" by hedge funds in their prime brokers' loan clients, and that trading is profitable. Elsewhere in academic papers, I enjoyed this title/subtitle combination: ""How Soon Is Now? Evidence of Present Bias from Convex Time Budget Experiments.""  Crisis flashback. Ten years ago yesterday, Standard & Poor's put some mortgage bonds on watch for downgrade, and then the financial crisis happened. I mean, eventually. But ""from that day onward, even the most cautiously optimistic economist or sanguine Federal Reserve governor should have known that the housing mess and the subprime debacle wasn’t going to be contained,"" says this Bloomberg article, ""the first in a series of stories looking back at the events of the global financial crisis 10 years ago."" Doesn't it feel like just yesterday? My own memories of the financial crisis are inextricably bound up with the fact that I started work at an investment bank the previous week: My first day at Goldman Sachs Group Inc. was July 2, 2007, and eight days later S&P downgraded those bonds in what I guess is as good a starting gun for the financial crisis as anything else. I like to think that I am somehow responsible. Anyway, I look forward to the next 14 months of crisis decennial commemoration, which will culminate in September 2018, the 10-year anniversary of that time I went on vacation for a week. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. I am starting to think that the right way to think about blockchain and cryptocurrencies and tokens might be the way you'd think about stocks, if stocks had just been invented. Here in 2017, it is uncontroversial to say that the invention of limited-liability joint stock companies utterly changed how humans organized their economic activities, and had huge impacts on economic productivity and on society as a whole. But it is also fair to say that the first few hundred years of stocks were mostly fraud and irrational speculation. Similarly with cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, it is possible both that proponents' grandiose claims about how they will transform finance and society will turn out to be true, and that most crypto stuff in our lifetimes will be nonsense. Anyway: ""Swiss city of Zug to offer blockchain-based digital identity to residents."" And here is Fred Wilson on tokens as a financing model: And here's a story about someone with a lot of ether: And: ""Smart contracts will need human juries."" And: ""Chief of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox denies embezzlement as trial opens."" And: ""Will Bitcoin Tear Itself Apart?"" People are worried that people aren't worried enough. I don't know exactly which recurring section ""Death-of-Bond-Market Concern Means It's Time to Buy, Peters Says"" fits into, but it sure seems like the sort of thing that goes around here somewhere. People are worried that people aren't worried enough? People are unworried because people are worried enough? People are worried about bond market liquidity, or unworried about bond market liquidity, or unworried because of worries about bond market liquidity? ""We have reached the third degree where we devote our intelligences to anticipating what average opinion expects the average opinion to be,"" Keynes said, and I suppose there is a similar game with the worrying. People are worried about unicorns. Oh hey it's a unicorn index: Here is the white paper. In back-testing, or back-indexing or whatever you call it, the index is up 74.8 percent from January 2015 through March 2017, much better than the S&P 500, which I guess retroactively justifies why so many public mutual funds have gotten into the unicorn investing game over the last few years. In worse unicorn news, my Bloomberg Gadfly colleague Shira Ovide is worried about pipes clogged with unicorns, which require very specialized plumbing skills: The bull case here is something like ""nah, they can just stay private forever; private markets are the new public markets and early investors can get liquidity without an IPO by selling to mutual funds,"" but it is hard to entirely believe that. And in more bad unicorn news, ""the Trump administration said it plans to rescind an Obama-era program that would allow foreign entrepreneurs who launch startup companies in the U.S. to live in the country."" And: ""Snap Shares Fall Below IPO Price for First Time."" Food Stuff. ""London restaurant Dirty Bones is lending diners 'Instagram kits' to better photograph their meals,"" it says here, and I know they are doing this to get a reaction from people like me, so I will just let it go, difficult though that is. Things happen. Trump to Nominate Randal Quarles as Fed Bank Regulator. U.S. Agency Moves to Allow Class-Action Lawsuits Against Financial Firms. Prime money market funds are back. Ford commercial paper is back. Elliott Set to Duel Berkshire for Energy Future’s Oncor. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Moves Away From Stock Picking.

2017-07-13T13:32:36.638Z,Main Street and Premium Listings,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-13/main-street-and-premium-listings,"Mr. and Ms. 401(k). Yesterday Jay Clayton gave his first big public speech as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, in which he laid out his goal to serve ""the long-term interests of the Main Street investor"": One perhaps odd emphasis there is ""do they have appropriate investment opportunities?"" One thing that the SEC traditionally does is protect investors from inappropriate opportunities: Mr. and Ms. 401(k) seem to love frauds, and the SEC tries to protect them from people who want to defraud them. Another thing that the SEC traditionally concerns itself with is whether companies have appropriate financing opportunities: Companies need money, and part of the SEC's mission is to ""facilitate capital formation,"" and it can't be so vigilant about protecting investors that companies can't raise money. But Clayton is saying something slightly different: He wants to make sure that investors have enough opportunities to make good investments. His implication is that investors are reasonably well protected from fraud under the current rules, and that companies can raise plenty of money -- but that a lot of that money is raised in private markets where Mr. and Ms. 401(k) can't invest, but would like to:  From the traditional SEC perspective, the current state of affairs is fine: Capital formation is well served by the private markets, and investor protection is well served by the stricter standards of the public markets. But from Clayton's perspective, that state of affairs is troubling, because Mr. and Ms. 401(k) can't participate in that capital formation: ""Many of our country's most innovative businesses"" are raising money privately, so the 401(k)s don't benefit from their growth.  Obviously one tradeoff here is that many of our country's most hopeless businesses also raise money privately; lowering the disclosure standards for public companies -- as Clayton hints he'd like to do, especially in areas of disclosure that go ""beyond the core concept of materiality to shareholders"" -- would give the 401(k)s more good investment opportunities but also more bad ones. But, as we have previously discussed, there is another potential tradeoff: It's not clear that the only advantage private markets have over public markets is freedom from SEC disclosure rules. Private markets also offer companies more flexibility on governance and structure, more opacity on stock price, more control over ownership, more protection from short-sellers and activists. If you want to flush all the unicorns out of the Enchanted Forest and into 401(k) accounts, you might need to do more than reduce the length of Form 10-K filings: You might need to make more fundamental changes to how public companies interact with their shareholders. FCA and Saudi Aramco. Speaking of which, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority has proposed a ""new premium listing category for sovereign-controlled entities."" The UK has a category of public company called a ""premium listing,"" in which companies need to comply with certain financial, disclosure, ownership and governance standards. Having a ""premium listing"" is good. (It is ""premium."") Some companies -- oh, let's not be coy, one company, Saudi Arabian Oil Co. -- would like to have a premium listing, but would prefer not to comply with the governance or ownership standards. Getting the Saudi Aramco listing would be a nice coup for London, and so the FCA has proposed a new listing type that is sort of ""premium, but for Saudi Aramco."" Companies in this category would have to meet the other premium listing requirements, but could be controlled by their sovereign shareholder and would not be subject to related-party-transaction limitations in their dealings with the sovereign.  The rationale for the new category is pretty much literally ""well, but it's Saudi Aramco"": That last sentence is not strictly true. It's a new listing option for companies of a distinct type which may wish to access UK markets and choose not to meet the higher standard represented by the premium listing regime, but who would like to be called ""premium"" anyway. This is fine! Obviously this is fine! These are just words! Of course Saudi Aramco is not going to stop being state-controlled just to list in the UK. Nothing in the real world changes if it lists in the UK as ""not premium,"" or as ""premium,"" or as ""premium with an asterisk."" In each case, investors get to choose whether to invest in Saudi Aramco, and can make that decision based on its financial condition and disclosures and their own views about its relationship with the sovereign. The games with words involved in these listing standards shouldn't matter much to anyone. Of course they do, because these days we all assume that investors cannot make their own decisions, that they are forced to buy whatever the market is selling, whatever is listed on a particular exchange or included in a particular index. But they are not really forced to do it. You could just decide to invest in Saudi Aramco, or not to, whether or not it is ""premium."" Insider trading. I think we are up to the Seventh Law of Insider Trading. The first six are: (1) don't do it, (2) don't do it by buying short-dated out-of-the-money call options on undisclosed merger targets, (3) don't text or email about it, (4) don't do it in your mother's account, (5) don't do it by planting bombs at a company and shorting its stock, and (6) don't do it while employed at the Securities and Exchange Commission. I hereby declare the Seventh Law: (7) If you are going to insider trade, don't Google ""how to insider trade without getting caught"" before or after you trade. I have mixed feelings about this law -- which, like its six friends, is not legal advice! -- because how would you know about the Laws of Insider Trading without Googling them a little bit? I suppose daily Money Stuff readers will be well prepared, but non-subscribers might get tripped up. (More reason to subscribe!) Fei Yan allegedly missed this one: Those are paragraphs 46 and 47 of the SEC's complaint against Yan, an engineering research scientist who allegedly insider traded in undisclosed merger targets that he learned about through his wife's job at a law firm. In paragraphs 45 and 48, Yan is allegedly buying short-dated out-of-the-money call options on merger targets in his mother's account. So he really needed the help! Still, Googling about insider trading while you are doing it is a no-no. The nature of property. Here is a story about how United Airlines Inc. wants to sell you a ticket and then come back to you later and offer to buy it back from you and re-sell it to someone else at a higher price, making airline ticketing into a continuous two-sided market instead of, you know, a service that you buy and then use. It is called the ""Flex-Schedule Program,"" and it is a little reminiscent of the ""Harberger tax"" paper we talked about a while back, in which two law professors argued that ""Property Is Another Name for Monopoly"" and that people should constantly be re-valuing and buying and selling all of their personal property. Only here it's just airline tickets. You buy your ticket, but then you are constantly pestered with its changing market value, and pressured to sell it if its price exceeds the consumer surplus you get from it. It is all maximally efficient and utterly awful! Soon it will be how everything works. Also this is the best part of the article, about the startup guy who pitched this plan to United: Why did they need the eggs? These are airline executives! Can't you just say to them ""we're going to move some bargain travelers to less-full planes and fill their seats with business travelers""? Have they never heard those terms? ""I am going to use dyed eggs to represent the fact that you sell some of your seats for more money than other seats?"" ""We do? My God, why did no one use painted food to tell me this before?"" The nature of the firm. While we're at it we could also turn employment into a continuous two-sided market instead of, you know, a long-term relationship that provides a stable income: Ah, the future, it's so great.  Crisis retro. Ten years ago, if someone had told you that Royal Bank of Scotland Group was going to pay $5.5 billion to settle U.S. government charges that it misleadingly sold shoddy mortgage bonds to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, you'd probably have thought that was a big deal, right? But now that settlement comes toward the tail end of a long chain of similar multibillion-dollar settlements by big banks -- albeit ""at the high end of other settlements"" in dollar terms -- and it's pretty much a shrug. Also another RBS mortgage settlement -- this one with the Department of Justice -- is still in the works. The mortgage settlements may never end, but eventually we will stop paying attention. Elsewhere: ""Pimco sues Wells Fargo over crisis-era mortgage bonds."" How's Martin Shkreli doing? Weird, real weird; the former chairman of his pharmaceutical company, Retrophin, testified in Shkreli's securities-fraud trial on Tuesday and Wednesday, and it was stuff like this: And: I wonder how many public company boards of directors have agenda items like ""Ask Chief Executive Officer to consider brushing his teeth more often."" But never mind Shkreli; how is the Wu-Tang Clan doing? The guy who helped Wu-Tang sell Shkreli that million-dollar one-copy album has a book coming out. Here is an excerpt about how he learned of Shkreli's drug-pricing practices, and how he rationalized selling him the album: Here's how RZA rationalized it: Maybe it would help inspire him to brush his teeth. A boiler room. Here are the SEC and Department of Justice cases against an alleged boiler room on Long Island. The charges are fairly standard: stock promoters working with insiders at microcap companies to pump up their stocks and then sell them at inflated prices to retirees with high-pressure sales tactics, that sort of thing. But the case is distinguished by involving stocks like Grilled Cheese Truck Inc., a company once promoted by retired General Wesley Clark (who is not involved in this case). Also the high-pressure sales tactics were pretty high-pressure: Classy! People are worried about unicorns. People are worried about Uber Technologies Inc., and yet they still want to be its chief executive officer: It is also an interesting compensation puzzle: Uber's valuation is enormous and its net income is negative, so it might take a while for it to grow into its valuation, and a new CEO who gets options struck at its huge private valuation will have a lot of work to do to see any upside. Though really there's no reason for Uber to strike its new CEO's options at the $69 billion valuation of its last private financing: Since then, Uber has slumped in the secondary market, and it is not unheard-of for employee stock-option valuations to be below funding-round headline valuations. I guess if I were in talks to be the new Uber CEO, I'd be arguing for a pretty low starting valuation. Honestly if the new CEO takes Uber public at a $69 billion valuation, that will be a pretty big win, and he or she should be rewarded for it. I am not in talks to be the new Uber CEO, but a lot of people apparently are, including Marissa Mayer (as I once guessed she would be). In other Uber news, it is merging its Russia business with local competitor Yandex NV, in its ""second retreat from a major market"" after abandoning China to Didi Chuxing last year. People are worried about bond market liquidity. Jay Clayton is worried about bond market liquidity! From the speech that we discussed above: Things happen.

2017-07-11T10:19:05.555Z,Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day,"Lorcan Roche Kelly
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-11/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here Trump campaign's own email scandal, Goldman's oil warning and doubts cast on U.S.-U.K. post-Brexit trade deal. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. A lawyer acting for President Donald Trump's eldest son acknowledged last night that Trump Jr. received an email offering a meeting with someone who had potentially damaging information on Hillary Clinton, with the New York Times reporting that the email said that the information was coming as part of a Russian government effort to help his father's White House bid. The president's son-in-law Jared Kushner is also likely to face questions after he was involved in advising the president on policy towards Qatar soon after talks on a Qatari $500 million investment stalled.  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is warning that oil could fall below $40 a barrel if there is no move from the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to increase output cuts. The bank, which recently admitted it had misjudged the commodities market this year, last month cut its end-of-year price target for crude by $7.50 to $47.50. A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for August delivery was trading at $42.25 at 5:30 a.m. Eastern Time.  Business leaders in the U.K. are warning that a promised post-Brexit trade deal between Britain and the U.S. will prove hard to deliver, with America's vastly greater leverage and experience in negotiating such deals likely to force Prime Minister Theresa May to make difficult compromises. Any deal will have an awkward starting point with national statistical agencies reporting that each currently runs a trade surplus with the other. In the U.K., sentiment among financial firms fell in the three months to June, the fifth drop in the last six quarters. There was one bright note for the economy as retail sales in Britain rebounded 2.1 percent in the second quarter, according to data from the British Retail Consortium. Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index added 0.7 percent, with Japan's Topix index rising by the same amount as a rally in technology shares helped propel the gauge to the highest level since August 2015. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.2 percent lower at 5:40 a.m. with defensive sectors leading the declines. S&P 500 futures were flat. The People’s Bank of China is showing signs that it is are ready to start pumping liquidity back into the country's financial system after the central bank conducted the first open-market operation in 13 days overnight. With 459.5 billion yuan ($67.6 billion) of funds issued via reverse-repurchase agreements and the PBOC’s medium-term lending facility coming due this week, government and policy banks are set to issue almost 500 billion yuan of bonds by Friday. With companies hoarding cash due to tax payments at the end of this month, the extra liquidity will probably be needed. In an unusual development, Taobao, the country's largest e-commerce platform owned by Alibaba Group Holding Ltd., is offering non-performing loans for sale to the highest bidder along side everything from food to electronics.  This is what's caught our eye over the last 24 hours."
2017-07-05T15:31:14.692Z,"Bitcoin to $50,000 Is Latest Call From Prolific Stock Picker","Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-05/bitcoin-to-50-000-is-latest-call-from-prolific-stock-picker,"Ronnie Moas, who for the past 13 years has made more than 900 stock recommendations via his one-man show at Standpoint Research, is now venturing into cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin will double to $5,000 next year, and reach $25,000 to $50,000 in the next decade, the Miami Beach, Florida-based Moas said in a note to clients Wednesday, where he also disclosed he bought “a little bit” of litecoin, bitcoin and ethereum in a Coinbase.com account.    It’s a testament to the exuberance around bitcoin, ethereum and other blockchain assets that equity investors who hadn’t been involved in cryptocurrencies are now starting to analyze and make bets on the sector along with established bitcoin enthusiasts who see long-term gains, even if they say there might be a correction after the recent rally. “There are only 21,000,000 bitcoins in circulation and the world will fight over those 21 million coins as confidence in currency and other investments deteriorates,” Moas wrote, referring to the algorithm that caps the amount of bitcoin that can be created. “I have little doubt that 1% of the money in cash, bonds, stocks and gold will end up in cryptocurrencies.” Bitcoin has more than doubled this year to as high as $3,000 as adoption increased, more institutional investors backed blockchain technology and the second-biggest digital currency, ether, started to become popular in fundraising rounds for tech startups. Bitcoin slid to as low as $2,544.40 today from its high on June 12 on concern that digital currencies can’t reach wider acceptance fast enough and that their gains have been overdone. Moas says he’s “only a bit concerned that there may be a near-term bubble,” but long term, there’s the potential to make triple-digit returns. Moas recommends securing cryptocurrency positions through services like the one offered by Trezor.io and reminds clients his post is for informational purposes only and shouldn’t be viewed as investment advice or as a recommendation."
2017-07-10T10:00:23.000Z,A Trader So Secret They’re Only Known by a Number Just Made Over $200 Million in One Month,"Tom Metcalf
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/secret-millions-for-0x00a651d43b6e209f5ada45a35f92efc0de3a5184,"An unknown cryptocurrency trader turned $55 million of paper wealth into $283 million in just over a month. The only clue about this person or persons, beyond a virtual wallet with the identification code 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184, surfaced on a June 11 Instagram posting, in Bahasa, in which he or she (or they) (or somebody posing as them) boasted about the 413 percent profit accumulated earlier this year from ether, the digital money of the Ethereum blockchain. “I get many private messages asking how much ether I have,” the post read, alongside photos that purported to be the hardware powering a mining operation but looked lifted from another website. “One of the cool things about Ethereum is that all wallets around the world are transparent and open for everyone to see. And this is my wallet’s savings.” Hidden identities are a popular feature of the twilight world of virtual money. Now that the total value of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ether, soared June 6 to more than $100 billion, approaching the market value of McDonald’s Corp., concerned regulators say it might be time to link wallet IDs with actual humans.    Secrecy persists from the days, earlier this decade, when Ross Ulbricht, going by the nom de guerre Dread Pirate Roberts, used bitcoin to launder money and traffic in narcotics, activities for which he started serving a life term at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in New York. That’s not to say that 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 or any other entities are doing anything illegal. But opacity may be worsening jagged price movements. The value of ether, for example, rose from about $8 a unit at the start of the year to crest at $400 in June before settling around $250 today. A lack of transparency could also be stifling the mainstreaming of online money, according to draft legislation issued by the European Parliament in March. “The credibility of virtual currencies will not rise if they are used for criminal purposes,” the draft said. “In this context, anonymity will become more a hindrance than an asset for virtual currencies” and their potential future popularity. Pseudonymity has always been a big part of the market’s allure. Upending traditional ways of doing business was the lodestar for Ethereum’s inventor, 23-year-old Vitalik Buterin. He released his software in 2015, not long after dropping out of Canada’s University of Waterloo. “One of its more important features is that you don’t have identities tied to this,” said Spencer Bogart, head of research at venture firm Blockchain Capital. “This financial privacy is an important characteristic.” Ether, the second-most-popular cryptocurrency after bitcoin, is used to pay for applications or programs that run on the Ethereum blockchain, a secured list of transactions that can be shared. That allows for the use of “smart contracts,” or pieces of computer code that make the terms of such agreements operate automatically. The blockchain has the potential to reshape business and finance by enabling immediate settlements of activities such as bank transfers and securities trades. JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp. and ING Groep NV are among those experimenting with it. The current value of all the ether held, $23 billion, means dozens of electronic wallets have accrued nine-figure positions. Many of them could be held by individuals, according to a Bloomberg analysis. Individuals can hold multiple wallets. Likely candidates to be crypto-billionaires include hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, Joseph Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a blockchain production studio that works on Ethereum, and Ethereum creator Buterin. Novogratz, a former executive at Fortress Investment Group and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., has a long way to go, but he’s been a consistent booster. He said last month that he has 10 percent of his net worth invested in virtual money. That’s a stake worth at least $90 million, given a net worth calculated at $925 million, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Novogratz declined to comment. Cryptocurrencies could become a $5 trillion industry, but they need to develop sound business principles to satisfy regulators and lend legitimacy, Novogratz said June 27 at a fintech conference in New York. Lubin, the former chief operating officer for Ethereum Switzerland GmbH, which developed the software, could hold hundreds of millions of dollars worth of ether, several investors said. The Canadian entrepreneur didn’t respond to requests for comment on his holdings. “The long-range vision is moving the fundamental transactional elements of our society from analog, friction-filled systems to natively digital frictionless systems,” Lubin told Bloomberg Radio June 21. Buterin said in a Reddit post last month his ether holdings equal what would amount to about $117 million today, according to calculations by Bloomberg. Like bitcoin, ether is struggling to overcome a reputation sullied by cyberattacks and technology bottlenecks. A flash crash last month saw the price of the cryptocurrency tumble to just 10 cents before rebounding to about $300. “A lot of lessons will be learned,” said Peter Denious, head of global venture capital at Aberdeen Asset Management in Stamford, Connecticut. “A lot of money will be lost before a lot of money can be made.” 0x00A651D43B6e209F5Ada45A35F92EFC0De3A5184 couldn’t be reached for further comment. — With assistance by Lisa Abramowicz, Pimm Fox, Harry Suhartono, Aansh Mehta, and Matthew Leising"
2017-07-10T19:30:06.980Z,Your Evening Briefing,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-10/your-evening-briefing-j4yjlfdw,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every afternoon? Sign up here. Think of the age you’d like to retire. Now take a look at how it stacks up with the data, and maybe rethink that number. Even past age 70, a growing number of U.S. seniors are declining to — or are unable to — retire. Older Americans are working more, even as those under 65 are working less, a trend expected to continue. So make sure you’re saving enough to buy whatever spaceship or time machine Elon Musk will be selling when you finally do retire. —Megan Hess One of the biggest reasons Republicans stick by Trump.  President Donald Trump has a huge opportunity to reshape a branch of government outside his control: the federal judiciary. He has already moved swiftly to fill an unusual, inherited vacancy on the Supreme Court, and now his aides are working their way through a large number of openings on the lower federal courts. Some of his first picks are up for a Senate committee vote this month. Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian lawyer offering potentially damaging information on Hillary Clinton. The president’s eldest son met with Natalia Veselnitskaya at Trump Tower in June 2016, after Trump had secured the Republican presidential nomination, according to a statement Sunday from Donald Trump Jr. He said he was joined at the meeting by Jared Kushner and the man managing his father’s campaign at the time, Paul Manafort. Americans can’t seem to retire. Almost 19 percent of people 65 or older were working at least part-time in the second quarter of 2017, according to the U.S. jobs report released on Friday. That’s the highest employment/population ratio for U.S. seniors in 55 years, before American retirees won better health care and Social Security benefits starting in the late 1960s. The trend looks likely to continue, so, millennials, prepare yourselves. A secret cryptocurrency trader turned $55 million of paper wealth into $283 million in just over a month. That person or persons is only known by the ID code on their virtual wallet. Now that the total value of cryptocurrency, such as bitcoin and ether, soared June 6 to more than $100 billion, approaching the market value of McDonald’s, concerned regulators say it might be time to link wallet IDs with actual humans. The first Model 3 is finally here. A single black Model 3 rolled off Tesla’s production line Friday with a serial number all its own, kicking off a company-defining six months. The car will belong to Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO and co-founder, who shared images of it on Twitter over the weekend. Men, Republicans, and northeasterners are the best tippers. Women tip a median of 16 percent, while Democrats and southerners leave a median 15 percent at a restaurant, according to a new survey of more than 1,000 American adults. That's compared with the median 20 percent left by men, Republicans, and residents of the northeast. Those who pay with plastic leave a median 20 percent, compared with 15 percent for those who pay in cash. The secret Russian vacation spot where you can rub elbows with Putin’s pals. Plyos, a 2,000-person medieval merchant town in Russia’s Golden Ring, has scarcely been in the spotlight since the 10th century. But lately, it has occupied an increasingly large share of national interest. The Russian prime minister regularly vacations in a sprawling compound just a few miles beyond the town’s main road, and the country’s richest businessmen are sweeping up weekend homes. Even Putin himself was rumored to be commissioning a house in the area.  "
2017-07-06T20:30:13.657Z,The Daily Prophet: Blame the French for the Latest Selloff,"Robert Burgess
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-06/the-daily-prophet-blame-the-french-for-the-latest-selloff-j4svzay5,"Many days it's almost impossible to identify the precise reason -- or reasons -- why markets are up or down. Thursday was not one of those days. It was all France's fault.A seemingly routine auction of 30-year French government bonds turned into anything but as traders put in fewer bids than many expected. Normally, that wouldn't be a big deal, but the global market has been on edge the last week as central bankers around the world step up their hawkish rhetoric. According to FTN Financial strategist Jim Vogel, it was ""a small event"" but one that the ""new bearish sentiment is incapable of taking in stride."" The selling was swift and severe, pushing yields higher across debt markets worldwide. Those in Germany rose to their highest in 18 months. Thoughts of contagion rattled equities amid concern higher rates would cut into the profitability of the many companies that binged on cheap debt the past decade. The dollar weakened as traders piled into euros on the prospect of juicer yields in the euro zone. Judging by the comments of perhaps the most influential investor in bond markets these days, this latest selloff may not prove short-lived like so many before. Ten-year Treasury yields have risen to 2.37 percent from 2.12 percent at the start of last week, and may not stop until they get ""toward 3 percent,"" DoubleLine Capital Chief Executive Officer Jeffrey Gundlach said in an e-mailed response to questions from Bloomberg News' Edward Bolingbroke, Liz Capo McCormick and John Gittelsohn. Many investors had been buying longer-dated sovereign bonds to hedge to their equity portfolios and ""that's why this unwind is so ugly,"" said Peter Tchir, head of macro strategy at Brean Capital. ""They are losing money on both the equity and debt side now.""WHAT WAS ONCE HOT IS NOW NOTIt's seems that only last month everybody was touting European stocks -- because it was only last month. The combination of cheap stocks relative to those found in the U.S. and signs of an improving euro zone economy made the continent's equities irresistible to many. Based on recent performance, though, maybe the old cliché about how it's better to be a seller when everyone is buying is true. The Stoxx Europe 600 Index fell 0.7 percent Thursday as bond yields rose, bringing its decline since mid-May to about 4 percent. That compares with a drop of 0.45 percent for the MSCI All Country World Index. Also working against the region's equities is a stronger currency. The Bloomberg Euro Index is up 6.9 percent since mid-April, making the euro zone exports more expensive to foreign buyers. The European Central Bank said last month that the euro zone's current-account surplus -- the broadest measure of trade because it includes investments -- fell in April to its lowest level since early 2015. DON'T FALL FOR THE GOLD TRAPDon't expect to be able to ride out the turbulence in markets in gold. That's because for the precious metal's top forecaster, bullion bulls are up against a clear and present danger -- the Federal Reserve, according to Bloomberg News' Susanne Barton and Ranjeetha Pakiam. The central bank's plan to raise interest rates again this year while potentially reducing its balance sheet is negative for the non-interest bearing asset, said Harry Tchilinguirian, the head of commodity markets strategy at BNP Paribas, which topped Bloomberg's gold accuracy rankings in the second quarter. He's among the most bearish forecasters, betting bullion will drop to $1,165 an ounce in the fourth quarter, from $1,225 on Thursday. Investors will face ""a greater opportunity cost of holding gold"" as Fed hikes drive real rates higher, Tchilinguirian said in an e-mail. Support from geopolitical events and hedging ""are unlikely to affect our directionally negative view on gold for the year."" WANT VOLATILITY? CHECK OUT THE WHEAT MARKETIf you thought watching the daily gyrations in Bitcoin was fascinating, just take a look at what's happening the market for wheat. The commodity jumped 52 percent between mid-May and yesterday, only to tumble the most in six years Thursday. A measure of 60-day volatility rose to the highest since August 2015. The rally was underpinned mainly by intensifying drought in the High Plains combined with less acreage devoted to the crop. Much of Montana and the Dakotas were in moderate to extreme droughts as of June 27, and the area for all varieties of wheat planted for 2017 is the smallest since data started in 1919, according to Bloomberg News' Sydney Maki and Jeff Wilson, citing U.S. Department of Agriculture data. ""U.S. wheat is pricing itself out of the world market,"" said Arlan Suderman, chief commodities economist at INTL FCStone. On Wednesday, Egypt, the top wheat buyer, was said to have purchased 410,000 metric tons from Russia and Romania in a tender, shunning U.S. supplies.  THAT'S SOME MISCOMMUNICATIONNever mind the dollar, euro, yen or pound. The real action in the foreign-exchange market can be found in Pakistan. Yes, Pakistan. One day after falling the most in nine years, the nation's rupee rose the most in three years. On Wednesday, the currency plunged as the State Bank of Pakistan said the drop was ""broadly aligned"" with economic fundamentals and would help boost growth. The rupee then recovered somewhat as Finance Minister Ishaq Dar blamed miscommunication by ""individuals"" and institutions for the decline Wednesday, which he called ""mind-boggling"" because the country's foreign currency reserves are stable, according to Bloomberg News' Kamran Haider, Faseeh Mangi and Ismail Dilawar. ""The Finance Ministry and the central bank are not on the same page,"" said Muzzammil Aslam, chief executive officer of EFG-Hermes Pakistan. ""While the State Bank allowed yesterday's freefall, the finance minister appears to have a broader view of the things."" A weak rupee boosts the cost of financing external debt and Dar ""has to keep that in mind."" TEA LEAVESIt's usually a fool's errand to try and use the monthly payroll report from ADP Research Institute, which doesn't track government hiring, to forecast the outcome of the Labor Department's all-important jobs report, but that doesn't stop many strategists from trying. On Wednesday, ADP said private payrolls rose by 158,000 last month, which was below the median estimate of economists for a gain of 188,000. Based on how much the ADP report has overestimated the Labor Department's report in recent months, economists should expect the government to say Friday that less than 100,000 jobs were created in June, according to the strategists at BMO Capital Markets. That compares with the median estimate of 178,000 jobs. The economists at FTN Financial come at it another way, observing that even though ADP's June report was weak, the May-June average is still 194,000, implying an above-consensus 241,000 reading for the Labor Department's jobs report for June.

2017-07-06T13:34:07.909Z,Value Investing and CEO Churn,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-06/value-investing-and-ceo-churn,"Value investing. The basic process of value investing is that you go look for stocks that are underpriced relative to their fundamentals, and you buy them, and you wait for everyone else to notice how underpriced they are, and you get tired of waiting, and you go complain to the press about how undervalued your stocks are. Here is an article where some value investors -- at Parnassus Investments, a mutual-fund firm -- complain that their undervalued stocks are still undervalued: Well, but! If you pride yourself on your ability to zig where others zag, then a mass epidemic of zagging should make your job easier. If you pride yourself on uncovering undervalued gems, then you should be thrilled that people are ignoring all the gems. (You can buy more!) But of course it doesn't quite work that way. You want the market to mis-price stocks so you can get a good deal, but then you want it to correctly price those stocks, so you can make money, preferably soon. You want the market to be irrational, but not for so long that you become insolvent. ""I don’t like calling my clients up every quarter and saying 'Sorry,'"" says a Parnassus manager. Being a value investor is in a sense about calling up your clients and saying ""Sorry,"" but for a few quarters, not a lot of quarters. This is a perennial issue in investing: Everyone is always a contrarian, so everyone always thinks that the market is wrong, and then some of those contrarians are proven correct by events and others aren't. The question, with the modern rise of passive investing, is whether something has fundamentally shifted. In a sense passive investing, herding, ""mindless buying of these technology names"" -- all of that should make it easier for fundamental investors to spot value. But what if spotting value is no longer rewarded? What if value investing doesn't work any more? What if the rise of indexing has permanently cut the link between corporate fundamentals and stock prices? What if indexing and smart beta are ""worse than Marxism"" -- what if the function of the market is now to allocate money based on historical correlations rather than on expectations about future cash flows? What if indexing will keep growing for so long that it puts all the value managers out of business before anyone notices their undervalued gems? Honestly, it seems a little far-fetched to me. But if you are an active manager, I can see why you might want to complain about it. CEOs. When Marissa Mayer left Yahoo Inc. after making about a quarter of a billion dollars and failing to turn its core business around, a lot of people said mean things about her, to the effect of ""that's a lot of money for failing."" Then there was a backlash to the backlash, arguing that Mayer did a pretty good job in a hard situation, and that the mean things people said about her were motivated by sexism rather than substance. But it was hard for me to feel sorry for Mayer, because, in Don Draper's words: ""That's what the money is for!"" If you get paid a quarter of a billion dollars for doing anything, successfully or otherwise, then people are going to criticize how you do it, and if you don't like that, well, you can put on your gold-plated noise-canceling headphones, hop on your private jet, and ignore them. This is in general how I think about the tradeoff between pay and unpleasantness for public-company chief executive officers. The job should be terrible! That's why you're getting paid so much! If you want a long tenure, a good lifestyle, and the uncritical admiration of everyone you meet, you should be a financial newsletter writer instead. The reason CEOs get paid so much is not that they are unique and irreplaceable talents. Quite the reverse: They're being compensated for being so replaceable, for the risk that some activist will come along, say extremely hurtful things about them, and force them out of a job.  Anyway, ""The bosses of America’s biggest and best-known companies are learning a common lesson this year: The pay is great, but job security has rarely been shakier."" Part of the premise of high CEO pay is that it is supposed to be linked to performance. This is debatable, but certainly the premise of high CEO precarity is that it is supposed to be linked to performance: You perform, or you're out. I am not sure that that is actually a good way to run a company -- perhaps stability, trust, long-term vision and modest pay are a better combination -- but it is in a sense an obvious way, one with quantifiable results and demonstrable responsiveness to shareholder demands. And so the life of a modern CEO is supposed to be one of constant struggle, solitary, rich, nasty, brutish and short.  Simon. At the most general level, how do you build a technology platform to do a banking thing? One way is to build it inside a bank. This way, you know what clients want and what the bank needs, and you have the right incentives and expertise to build a good product. But then only your bank will use it: If Goldman Sachs Group Inc. builds a platform to trade bonds or whatever, it will have a hard time convincing JPMorgan Chase & Co. to sign up. But this can work; arguably it describes, say, RiskMetrics, or BlackRock Inc.'s Aladdin. Another way is to build it as part of a bank consortium: You get a bunch of banks to work on the platform together and agree to share it. This will probably be pretty slow. The first, like, 50 meetings of the consortium will be about sharing credit and protecting each bank's rights, not about actually building the thing. No one will want to share their special sauce with their rivals, and the thing may end up feeling compromised. But this can work; arguably it describes, say, the Depository Trust & Clearing Corporation, or the International Swaps and Derivatives Association.  A third way is to build it on your own and try to sell it to banks. This can be hard because banks are pretty protective; they like using their own systems and don't always trust upstart outsiders with their data and executions. But this can work; arguably it describes, say, Bloomberg LP (disclosure: where I work).  A fourth way is to build it on your own and try to displace the banks. This can be hard because the banks are pretty big, and pretty entrenched by regulation; it is easy to say ""we will create a brand new financial system that disintermediates incumbent banks"" but it doesn't actually happen that often. But this can work; arguably it describes, say, the rise of high-frequency traders as market-makers in the stock market. I think those are the main ways, and while all of them have worked in the past, none of them are easy. They're worth thinking about when you hear that blockchain, or whatever, is going to revolutionize banking. How? Will a bank build a proprietary blockchain thing and then get other banks to join it? Will a consortium of banks get together and work seamlessly to build a joint blockchain thing? Will an outside technology firm build a blockchain thing and convince a bunch of banks to sign up for it? Will bitcoin or Ethereum just displace banks? Maybe! But all of those paths are pretty difficult, because of how banks are embedded in our financial system, and because of how banks operate culturally. Anyway here's a story about Simon, a platform that Goldman Sachs (disclosure: where I used to work) built to issue structured notes. It wants other banks to issue structured notes on Simon, but they don't want to, because it is a Goldman Sachs platform. So it ""is soliciting investments that would value Simon at about $75 million and lay the groundwork for a spinoff of the business,"" and it ""is talking to several firms about a deal to both invest in Simon and agree to sell products through it."" Employee retention. Here is a fascinating French employment-law case about ... whether deferred bonuses are legal? ""A former Morgan Stanley dealmaker in Paris told an employment tribunal that the lender unfairly withheld $1.5 million in deferred pay a year after he raked in more than $100 million in fees while advising Patrick Drahi on a $23 billion acquisition."" I mean, sure, it is unfair that you would earn a bonus one year and not keep all of it just because you left the firm before it fully vested. Certainly I was sad to leave behind unvested equity compensation when I left banking. But banks want to ""reward loyalty,"" as Morgan Stanley's lawyer put it, and regulators want bankers to have skin in the game for the long term, and so they use at-risk deferred compensation. Everyone knows that -- the banker here, Bernard Mourad, ""accessed a website specifically dedicated to the compensation plan where the vesting schedule is 'very clearly mentioned' nearly 100 times and received multiple emails about it"" -- and, while there is some grumbling about it, no one really expects it to go away. If anything the regulatory push is to more deferred compensation, and more ways for banks to take it back. On the other hand, I often joke that banks are essentially socialist paradises run for the benefit of their workers, and French employment tribunals might also be socialist paradises run for the benefit of workers, so perhaps this tribunal will undermine the work of the banks and bank regulators and order Morgan Stanley to give Mourad his money.  Elsewhere, ""I'm much more than simply a pitchbook,"" says one of the ""300 financial professionals with six to 10 years of post-MBA experience"" surveyed for a recent report on the financial industry, and you'd hope so, six years after an MBA! The survey basically covers all of the millennial stereotypes: Young post-MBAs want ""a sense of belonging and value,"" ""an inclusive culture"" of ""authentic and genuine"" values, and companies that are socially engaged. Maybe banks really are doomed? How's Martin Shkreli doing? So-so! Prosecutors in his fraud trial were not completely successful in stopping him from making fun of them in public, but they did convince a judge to bar him from making fun of them in or around the courthouse, which he did last week: One of the great English words, especially if you are a lawyer, is ""relatively."" Relative to what? Shkreli is 34! I suppose he is young relative to, say, his lawyer, but I am not sure that his extreme youth is much of a defense. Anyway the judge told him to knock off the impromptu courthouse press conferences, because of worries that his jurors might hear him. We have talked before about my theory that Shkreli's strategy was to get everyone in America to hate him, so that he can't get a fair trial. That strategy almost worked -- it took forever to find 12 impartial jurors, and his lawyers moved for a mistrial because of all the hate -- but not quite. But there's still time! As Bill Gerath points out by email, you could explain the gag order by assuming that, ""having inadvertently left a few New Yorkers who didn't know and despise him, Shkreli is actively trying to instill a personal hatred in the jurors, thus setting up his appeal."" Blockchain blockchain blockchain. ""Bitcoin to $50,000 Is Latest Call From Prolific Stock Picker,"" and is ""prolific"" ... what you want ... in a stock picker? Boy, that guy has sure picked a lot of stocks! Were they ... the right stocks? ""It doesn't have to be terribly prolific,"" says Salinger's Esmé. ""Just so that it isn't childish and silly."" Anyway, right, bitcoin $50,000. Elsewhere: ""Former Dogecoin Exchange CEO Faces Fraud Charges."" People are worried that people aren't worried enough. Yesterday the Federal Reserve released the minutes of last month's Open Market Committee meeting and, of course, ""a few participants expressed concern that subdued market volatility, coupled with a low equity premium, could lead to a buildup of risks to financial stability."" People are worried about unicorns. ""IPO Market Isn’t Quite Back as Many Startups Are Still Holding Out,"" is the headline here, as bankers and investors encourage the unicorns to get out of the Enchanted Forest while the getting is good: Elsewhere, a Brooklyn coffee shop is suing Starbucks Corp., claiming that it came up with the idea for the Unicorn Frappuccino first and that Starbucks stole it. If I were responsible for the unicorn frappuccino I'd keep quiet about it but whatever. Things happen. Fed Officials Ready to Start Shrinking Portfolio in Months.

2017-07-06T04:01:00.001Z,Surfer Who Saved the World from WannaCry Gets Ready for the Next Big Virus,"Gavin Finch
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-07-06/surfer-who-saved-world-from-wannacry-attack-girds-for-next-wave,"The 23-year-old who saved the world from a devastating cyberattack in May was asleep in his bed in the English seaside town of Ilfracombe last week after a night of partying when another online extortion campaign spread across the globe. Around 6 p.m. on June 27, Marcus Hutchins, a self-taught computer-security researcher and avid surfer, was awakened by a phone call from a colleague telling him another attack was underway. Dreading a return of the virulent WannaCry malware that he stopped in its tracks the previous month, Hutchins logged on to his computer in the house he shares with his parents and younger brother to scan the latest reports. By then, more than 80 Ukrainian banks, government agencies and multinational firms including shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S and Russia’s biggest oil company Rosneft PJSC had been hit by a ransomware attack spreading like an electronic plague across their networks. Within 20 minutes, Hutchins later recounted, he got hold of a sample of the malware and was relieved to see it wasn’t another WannaCry, which infected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries, but something more targeted and less virulent. Though both attacks took advantage of flaws in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows operating system to spread their payloads, WannaCry used the internet to propagate itself -- each compromised computer would scan and infect another, creating a snowball effect -- while the so-called Petya attack was confined to local networks. Petya appeared bigger at first because hackers hit Ukrainian software company M.E.Doc and used an automatic update feature to download its malware onto the computers of all users of the software, Hutchins said. Researchers like Hutchins and his colleagues at Los Angeles-based threat-intelligence firm Kryptos Logic are akin to seismologists, scanning the internet for electronic tremors that could signal the next attack. This time he was only an observer, but on May 12 Hutchins stopped the WannaCry attack that crippled organizations from Britain’s National Health Service to Deutsche Bahn in Germany and Renault SA factories across Europe. With a mop of curly hair, baggy jeans, T-shirt and sneakers, Hutchins is an unlikely hero. He rarely leaves rural north Devon, where he has lived since he was 8, and hadn’t traveled abroad until last year. He learned to program computers at 12 and was tracking and disrupting botnet attacks for his own enjoyment before anyone paid him to do so. Read more: A QuickTake Q&A on how ransomware works Hutchins started a blog under the pseudonym MalwareTech while still a teenager and was hired by Kryptos in 2015. He said his parents and friends didn’t even know he had a job until the WannaCry attack. Hutchins was supposed to be enjoying a week’s holiday, but returning home after a lunch of burgers and cheesy chips with a friend and seeing the carnage WannaCry was inflicting, he couldn’t resist jumping in. “The fact that so many NHS trusts were being hit at the same time was pretty much unprecedented,” Hutchins said in an interview a few weeks after the attack, drinking Coca-Cola in a hotel bar in Ilfracombe, a picturesque but faded tourist town. “That for me was a massive red flag, which showed that this thing was spreading on its own.” Most ransomware, which encrypts files on a target machine to force its owner to make a payment in exchange for decryption, is spread via email attachments from rogue senders that infect host computers when they’re opened. Hutchins said he’d expect a handful of people to click on a mass email over a few days, not thousands of employees at scores of medical facilities at the same time. After analyzing a sample of the malware and seeing it spread by exploiting vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s network file-sharing protocols, he realized it was using a cyberweapon allegedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. Known as “EternalBlue,” it was part of a cache of sophisticated NSA hacking tools targeting Microsoft software that were obtained by the Shadow Brokers criminal gang last year and leaked onto the internet in April. Hutchins also noticed a quirk buried deep in the malware code. It tested for the existence of an unregistered nonsensical domain name. He promptly registered the domain for 8.5 pounds ($11) and redirected all traffic to a server designed to capture malicious data, known as a sinkhole, which would allow him to monitor the progress of the attack. Although he didn’t realize it at the time, Hutchins had inadvertently triggered the malware’s kill switch. Before infecting and encrypting a computer’s hard drive, WannaCry would query the domain, and as long as it remained unregistered would proceed with the attack. Now, when the malware checked the domain and found it active, it immediately shut down. About 100 million attempts to infect computers, including more than 7 million in the U.S., have been mitigated since then, according to Kryptos data. “At the time, we were just like ‘Yay, we can track it now,’ we didn’t know that we’d stopped it,” Hutchins said. “The minute we registered the domain we were looking at like 5,000 or 6,000 unique systems all connecting, and it went up to 200,000 within an hour. I remember thinking: Holy shit, this is really big.” Hutchins is part of a global community of online security researchers and bloggers who battle with hackers and cybercriminals from their home offices at all hours of the day and night. Given the wave of attacks in recent years, they’re in high demand from governments and corporations and can command six-figure salaries while still in their early 20s. Hutchins said he has been courted by some of the world’s biggest cybersecurity firms. In 2015, he interviewed with Britain’s top-secret Government Communications Headquarters but went to work for Kryptos instead after it made him an offer he said he “couldn’t refuse.” “He’s a natural talent,” said Salim Neino, 33, Kryptos’s chief executive officer, who hired Hutchins after reading his blog. “He was obviously solving hard problems and he wasn’t doing it for monetary reward, and those are some of the key traits of great cyberwarriors.” Neino, a self-taught programmer who got his first computing job at 15, co-founded Kryptos nine years ago. The firm doesn’t do any marketing and has no salespeople among its 25 employees. Hutchins said he didn’t ask for a raise after WannaCry because he had just been given one. He wouldn’t say how much he earns, but money goes a long way in Ilfracombe, where 1 in 5 children comes from a family whose income is less than 60 percent of the national average. He said he invests his earnings in stocks and bitcoin, and made thousands of pounds shorting the British currency after the country voted to leave the European Union last year. Given the nature of his work and his tendency to sound off on social media without much of a filter, Hutchins had kept his online and real-world lives separate. “No one knew on either side what the other side did,” he said. WannaCry changed that forever. After registering the domain that Friday afternoon in May, Hutchins posted a link to it online so others could track the attack’s progress. Within a few hours it became clear that WannaCry had stopped self-propagating, and fellow researchers started tweeting that it was @MalwareTechBlog who had saved the day. Pretty soon he was being bombarded with thousands of emails and direct messages on Twitter from journalists and security companies wanting to know whether their clients had been infected. Hutchins knew it was only a matter of time before his identity was blown and admits feeling a little scared. “Generally, you don’t want to advertise what you’re doing as you don’t want to piss off the bad guys,” Hutchins said. “We published the tracker not knowing we’d foiled it. Had I known that, I wouldn’t have publicized that it was me. Angry criminals are the worst criminals.” For the next 72 hours, Hutchins went without sleep while fending off ever more aggressive attacks from hackers trying to take his servers offline to disable the kill switch and repropagate WannaCry. Hutchins thinks that was mostly the work of low-level, semi-skilled hackers referred to in the industry as skids, or script kiddies. They aren’t in it for the money, he said, they just like causing as much trouble as possible. By Sunday, the British media had identified Hutchins as the man who stopped WannaCry, and the next day he had journalists camped outside his house, 170 miles from London, stuffing business cards through his letterbox and ringing the doorbell. At one point Hutchins jumped over the back wall of his yard and fled through a car park. “When I was outed, my parents were pretty shocked and my friends still don’t believe that I have a job,” Hutchins said. “Being unmasked was pretty horrendous.” Hutchins claims to not like people very much, but he’s affable and engaging. Several times during a walk around Ilfracombe’s harbor and through its narrow streets, friends and acquaintances called out greetings. He chafes at being identified as a hero and said he doesn’t have plans to move, though he did enjoy a recent trip to Copenhagen to give a speech at an industry convention. “What we did with WannaCry was impressive in terms of the scale of what we stopped, but on a technical level all we did was register a domain,” Hutchins said. “My employer was already paying me way more than I was worth, so the whole WannaCry thing didn’t really change anything.” Kryptos’s Neino is adamant that Hutchins deserves to be called a hero and warns that everyone should prepare for more attacks. “We’re going to see a wave of these attacks if Shadow Brokers make good on their promise to release more exploits,” Neino said. “They’ve made good on every other threat, so there’s no reason to think they won’t this time.” Petya was proof of more to come. After pulling another all-nighter, Hutchins said, he just wanted to go back to bed. — With assistance by Edward Robinson"

2017-07-05T13:03:26.555Z,Crossing the Rubicon and Gagging Shkreli,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-07-05/crossing-the-rubicon-and-gagging-shkreli,"The importance of a classical education. William Cohan has a hilarious and horrifying story about Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni in the White House, in which Goldman people lob anonymous and erudite insults at their former colleagues who went to work for Donald Trump. Here, for instance, is a description of Dina Habib Powell: Oh man, ""content lite"" is the most Goldman of all insults, a way of saying ""dumb"" that is both deniable and business-jargon-y. (Also: ""intellect and revenue generation"" are pretty different things!) But Powell actually comes off quite well in the profile, which is more than can be said for Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, who apparently had to listen to all the mean things that people said about him and then respond to them: Steve Bannon, meanwhile, gets written off in just a paragraph as not really Goldman: I guess now is the time for my usual disclosure, that I worked for Goldman Sachs for four years and left as a vice president, same as Bannon. So: barely at all? Maybe I should stop disclosing it. Meanwhile here is what a former Goldman director had to say about Gary Cohn: See, kids? Even if you become president of Goldman Sachs, your career will still be held back if you are not familiar with the details of Julius Caesar's. Also, though: What Rubicon had Goldman crossed? I feel like most companies' board-level discussions do not involve the phrase ""crossed the Rubicon,"" due not to a lack of classical education but to a lack of drama. What were they up to over at Goldman? I hope it was like: How's Martin Shkreli doing? He's fine, really, but the people prosecuting him for fraud are finding the experience pretty stressful and wish he would stop saying mean things about them: Oh come on! They are trying to put him in prison! And all he wants to do is make fun of them a little, before they do! (Also, he is hitting them right where it hurts: in the micro-hierarchy of prestige in which U.S. federal prosecutors in the Eastern District of New York worry that people look down on them for not being in the Southern District.) Look, that is a reasonable tradeoff: They are trying to use the immense power of the state to lock him in a cage for years, and he is making fun of them. The poor babies! Let him make fun of them. It is probably not helping his case, but that is his problem, not theirs. Fortunately they have not asked for a gag order against me, so I am free to say: This is a junior varsity move. Elsewhere: Apparently teen trader Jacob Wohl is ""already a mini-star in conservative media""? And on Friday the Securities and Exchange Commission ""filed fraud charges against the clandestine founder of a purported Bitcoin platform and a chain of co-working spaces located in former bars and restaurants, alleging that he bilked investors in both companies while hiding his connection given his checkered past with regulators in the U.K.""  $123.47 If I told you that Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., and a bunch of other prominent tech stocks all closed at exactly $123.47 on Monday, you'd be like, ""yeah, that sounds right,"" right? Like I mean if I told you that every stock closed at $666.66, thousands of birds fell dead out of the sky onto the floor of the stock exchange, all the floor traders started speaking in Akkadian, and the water fountains ran with blood, you'd be like ""sure, yeah, that's 2017 for you."" We are beyond the point where news can be surprising any more; these days stunning portents of doom don't even move the VIX. But, no, the $123.47 thing was just a data error, and ""no actual trades were affected by the glitch."" Never mind! Don't sue the trustee. The basic way that finance works is that there are pots of money and people with claims on those pots of money. And sometimes bad things happen, and the pot of money gets smaller, and the people with claims lose money, and they feel sad and aggrieved. So they decide to sue someone. Often, if the pot got smaller, it's because someone affiliated with it did something wrong, and the pot of money is legally responsible. So the claimants sue the pot of money. But this is usually a big mistake: If they win, the pot of money will pay them money for their lawsuit, which will reduce the amount of money in the pot, which was their money to begin with. So they are no better off, but they will also have to pay lawyers, so they are in fact worse off. This is so obvious that you wonder why people keep missing it, though I suspect that part of the answer is that the lawyers really want them to miss it. This describes essentially all shareholder litigation: A company does a bad thing, its stock drops, its shareholders sue, and the company gives them money, which was their money anyway, except that now a third of it goes to lawyers. But there are more complicated versions. Here, for instance, is a story about some residential mortgage-backed securities that lost money in the financial crisis, which led the holders to sue the trustee of the securities, Wells Fargo & Co. You might think that the trustee -- Wells Fargo -- is distinct from the pot of money -- the mortgage-backed securities -- but the trustee is indemnified by the pot of money, so the bondholders suing the trustee ended up sort of suing themselves: A good rule of thumb is that you should try not to sue anyone whose legal expenses you are also paying.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain. So I have to say that warehouse receipts -- the documents proving the existence and ownership of base-metal stocks in warehouses, which are used to obtain financing for those metals -- seem like a good use case for the blockchain. There is no centralized issuer or repository of the receipts, they are used by a bunch of different parties who have no particular reason to trust each other, and they apparently get forged a lot. So: It is not a perfect solution, since you still have the problem of the nexus between the paper/blockchain/whatever receipt and the actual pile of metal. My immutable unforgeable cryptographically secure blockchain record proving that I have 10,000 pounds of aluminum in a warehouse is not much use to a bank if I then smuggle the aluminum out of the warehouse through the back door. Still it is an improvement over a paper-based system, plus eventually you can hook up the doors to the blockchain (""of things""!) and make it physically as well as cryptographically tamper-proof. Elsewhere! And: ""Seven signs of over-hyped Fintech."" European banks. Here is ""Equity versus bail-in debt in banking: an agency perspective,"" from the European Systemic Risk Board, arguing that total loss-absorbing capital of big banks should consist mostly of debt: The intuition here is that, on the one hand, the difference between equity and bail-in-able debt doesn't matter that much: Either way, the point is that you have private investors who are able and willing to bear a bank's losses without impacting taxpayers or insured depositors. But on the other hand, a bank with more outside equity dilutes the equity incentives of its insiders, and the less they own of the bank the more likely they are to make bad decisions to benefit themselves rather than the bank. This is the opposite of what most people think, that the way to make banks safer is to increase their total amount of equity. Elsewhere: ""Italy Formally Takes Control of Monte dei Paschi."" And here is Jonathan Algar on the rescue of Veneto Banca SpA and Banca Popolare di Vicenza SpA (""V&V""; SRB is the Single Resolution Board and BRRD is the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive): Twenty theses about Twitter. Here are Eric Posner's, which strike me as good but slightly askew. ""People sign up for Twitter for two reasons: to obtain information and to exert influence,"" reads the first thesis, and I think this is correct. ""Twitter serves these functions poorly,"" begins the second, and this is more debatable but surely mostly true. But I would insert a sort of Thesis 1a: ""People actually use Twitter to hang out and waste time with their friends,"" which renders most of its behaviors more legible than Posner's view does, and moots some of his later theses.  Also here are Theses 19 and 20: One thing that you see in the Casual Late Marxist school of internet social criticism is this notion of Late Capitalism operating automatically, of capital perpetuating itself without the need for human decisions. That seems to ... inadequately describe Twitter? Some people made a dumb way to hang out with their friends, and some dumb people like me used it to hang out with their friends in dumb ways, and also capital exists. Explaining the social engagement through the lens of capital seems to miss the point. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. Goldman Sachs research analysts are so worried that people aren't worried that they're calling for a war: They've really crossed the Rubicon with that call. People are worried about unicorns. What people are worried about in the Enchanted Forest these days is not whether unicorns are overvalued or whether venture capitalists will have access to liquidity in their investments, but whether those venture capitalists are creeps. The answer is yes, at least some of them are creeps, which you can tell because they write Medium posts with titles like ""I’m a Creep. I’m Sorry."" It is actually a fascinating development: Powerful men have been credibly accused of sexual harassment before, of course, and it has even led to career consequences for them, but this is the first time I can remember when multiple powerful men were accused of harassment and immediately, publicly, said ""ooh, you're right, sorry."" It's not perhaps the progress you would want to see on sexual harassment, but it is a sort of progress. In general I think the desire for power is undertheorized in modern economic life. There is this sort of bland background assumption that people who work in lucrative fields are mostly interested in money, and that anything that they do that doesn't look money-motivated -- sexually propositioning women who come to them for funding, say -- can be explained by personal idiosyncrasy or some vague idea of ""industry culture."" But if you think that people become venture capitalists, or investment bankers, or financial newsletter writers, or anything, purely for the money, you are missing out on most human motivation. Being a VC is interesting: There is science or whatever, and you get to see a lot of products, and meet a lot of people, and go to parties. But also a central feature of the job is that young people come to you and ask you to make their dreams come true, and you do, or don't, your call. That is power, and an industry that offers power will attract people who are interested in having and using power, and if some of those people use that power for illicit purposes, that is not exactly surprising.

2017-06-29T10:00:07.000Z,Bitcoin Has Become So Volatile It Looks Like an ETF on Steroids,"Dani Burger
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-29/bitcoin-s-become-so-volatile-that-it-looks-like-a-steroidal-etf,"There’s volatility. And then there’s bitcoin volatility. With virtual currency flash crashes and a recent string of ransomware attacks all but obliterating bitcoin’s incremental stability, it’s become hard to find a comparable asset. Indeed, the closest match is an exchange-traded fund on leverage steroids that’s supposed to be highly volatile. Bitcoin now swings more than the Direxion Daily Junior Gold Miners Index Bull 3x Share, or JNUG, an ETF that uses borrowed funds to deliver three times the return on an index tracking small-cap mining companies. And the volatility spread between bitcoin and the inverse short version of the fund, JDST, is the smallest in more than three years. The uptick in volatility looms over the bitcoin market’s legitimization. Since a bubble burst in 2014, the cryptocurrency had become more stable, with two-month realized volatility reaching it’s lowest level in April 2016. But the recent price swings are a painful reminder that bitcoin has a long way to go before it behaves like a mainstream currency, if it ever does, said Dave Nadig, chief executive officer of San Francisco-based research firm ETF.com. “There have been a lot of advances and it’s been taken more seriously by investors and institutions,” Nadig said. “But there are all sorts of small steps that start legitimizing a market, and by design bitcoin is inherently unregulated. Part of the reason you end up with volatility is because of the lack of market structure.” Considering some high profile investors have pinned their hopes on bitcoin’s stabilization, the resurgence of wild swings isn’t a great look. Former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz has 10 percent of his capital invested in cryptocurrencies, which he said could become a $5 trillion industry, and is looking to add more bitcoin if it falls below $2,000. It’s currently trading for more than $2,500. Bitcoin has enjoyed a 167 percent advance so far this year, but has become increasingly correlated to a smaller but growing virtual currency based on the ethereum blockchain. Known as ether, that cryptocurrency quickly plunged from more than $300 to 10 cents last week on Coinbase’s GDAX exchange before snapping back. It’s currently trading for around $309, according to prices compiled by CoinMarketCap.com. “Over the last two and a half years to mid-last year, volatility had been trending way down and compared to roughly that of small-caps,” Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital LLC, said by phone.“Some of the major drivers now have been bitcoin trading with other cryptocurrencies, and when you have these big run ups, it increases the chances you’ll have a large drop.” To be sure, precious metal markets have been seen low volatility recently, helping bitcoin jump above the miners index. The CBOE/COMEX Gold Volatility Index has fallen 25 percent this year, reaching an all-time low last month. Even so, JDST and JNUG are still the third and fourth most volatile ETFs out of the more than 2,000 in the U.S. Gold and cryptocurrencies are often considered related in the financial markets because of their standing as alternatives to cash. However the precious metal, which has been used in this way for ages, is typically more stable than bitcoin, which started in 2009. JNUG’s realized volatility is nearly one point lower than bitcoin, according to 25-day data compiled by Bloomberg. That’s the first time bitcoin jumped above the ETF since early 2014, when the cryptocurrency plunged 44 percent in two months following a surge in prices from $13 to $746 in just one year. “The broad arc is that there has been an increase in acceptance of bitcoin among various pools of capital,” Bogart said. “The volatility of it in some ways could be turning away some traditional larger investors who say, ‘I can’t touch this, it’s too volatile.’”"

The slide follows declines last week by rival digital currencies such as ether, which caused cryptocurrency exchanges Bitfinex and ShapeShift to halt trading.

2017-06-30T15:59:48.191Z,Digital Twins Inch Closer to an Energy Takeover,"Nathaniel Bullard
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-30/digital-twins-inch-closer-to-an-energy-takeover,"In a prescient 2011 essay, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared that “software is eating the world.” Six years on, software is eating more of the world than ever -- and it is also creating. One of those creations is digital twins, virtual models of industrial equipment, built up with gigabytes and terabytes of sensor data, that allow companies to remotely monitor the performance of power plants, jet engines and … well, anything worth monitoring, really. These digital twins will create numerous opportunities for companies and their clients, as well as raise challenging questions. Digital twins aren’t unique to a particular kind of company, though industrial conglomerates General Electric Co. and Siemens AG are their most visible proponents. The technology represents an evolution within industrial firms and the logical outgrowth of a number of factors that my Bloomberg New Energy Finance colleagues have identified: cheaper and better sensing, processing and data transmission.   It’s also early days for the technology. Research firm Gartner puts digital twins in the “innovation trigger” phase of its Internet of Things hype cycle. Still, the potential market for digital twins is already large, even within a select group of energy and transport assets. Consider wind turbines, which have seen 265,000 installed since 2000. Wind turbines alone are a far larger market for digital twinning than the 30,000 jet engines in GE’s digitized fleet. The market for digital twins in fossil fuel power plants may seem smaller (BNEF tracks only 477 new coal plants commissioned since 2000), but each one contains dozens, perhaps hundreds, of pieces of equipment that could be digitized. That market will only grow, as the number of devices that can be digitized grows and the cost of digitizing them drops. So which industries are best situated to own and operate digital twins? Ed Crooks of the Financial Times explored the industrials-versus-software question in an article this week: In Crooks’ words, “what is it exactly that they do?” Is a turbine manufacturer a maker of dumb metal for a software company to optimize? Is software a service and support for industrial operations, or are industrial operations the input to a software-determined set of processes or even businesses? Another question: How many digital twins is too many? Take those 265,000 wind turbines and GE's 30,000 jet engines; both have spinning rotors and can and would need to capture much of the same types of data. Then there are the 15,000 solar projects -- but those projects are each made up of tens of thousands (even millions) of individual solar panels as well as other pieces of equipment. What is the twin of a solar project? Is it the entire plant? The inverter “string” of hundreds of solar panels? Or will a solar project’s digital twin be a family of twins, so to speak, each a single solar panel? As processing becomes cheaper, as sensors become better, as data transmission becomes both, is there a logical upper limit to how many digital twins the world can have? A final question: What is the liability paradigm in a world of digital twins? A digital twin could assess an impending failure in a piece of industrial equipment, and a company could fail to act on it. Or a digital twin could fail to predict a failure, and industrial equipment could suffer. Where is the liability in such scenarios? To put it another way: Are digital twins the black boxes of the world? And if so, how long before a digital twin is called to testify against its physical counterpart and its corporate operators?

2017-06-27T22:03:06.471Z,"Ransomware Becomes Go-To Hack as Bitcoin Rallies, NSA Tools Leak","Jordan Robertson
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/ransomware-becomes-go-to-hack-as-bitcoin-rallies-nsa-tools-leak,"A recent outbreak of ransomware attacks, from the WannaCry worm in May to Tuesday’s infection of thousands of computer systems around the globe, shows that digital stickups are becoming the go-to hack for cybercriminals, fueled by powerful leaked U.S. government exploits and the rise of bitcoin and other anonymous digital currencies. Tuesday’s attack showed no signs of slowing down, as cybersecurity researchers had not found a kill switch similar to the one that allowed them to stop WannaCry after it had infected hundreds of thousands of computer in more than 150 countries, preventing it from becoming one of the worst attacks on record. The new infections, which appeared concentrated in Ukraine before spreading globally, are a sign that ransomware is becoming a routine risk of doing business, as other forms of attacks get less profitable. Banks and retailers have strengthened their defenses, driving the price for stolen credit card numbers down to as little as 50 cents apiece, according to research from Symantec Corp., the biggest cybersecurity software maker. But ransomware demands are on the rise, nearly tripling from an average of about $300 per computer infected in 2015 to more than $1,000 each last year, Symantec said. Earlier this month, a South Korean web hosting company agreed to pay more than $1 million to unlock its servers in what’s believed to be the biggest ransomware payout on record. ""The new versions of ransomware are the perfect crime,"" said Jack Danahy, co-founder of Barkly Protects Inc., a Boston-based cybersecurity firm. ""It’s super-easy to do -- monkeys could do it -- and the profits are remarkably high. And the third thing that makes it perfect is anonymity, because nobody wants to get caught. That’s why this thing is growing."" It’s possible that Tuesday’s outbreak may not spread as quickly or be as damaging as WannaCry, whose early victims included hospitals in the U.K. that had to shut some services while dealing with cleanup. The new malware uses an exploit called EternalBlue to spread by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows operating system, similar to WannaCry. But many of those weaknesses have been patched for months -- meaning that many computers already have protection against its key propagation mechanism. The new malware does have additional capabilities that let it spread by other means through internal networks, so anyone who clicks on a malicious email attachment could put their entire organization at risk. The rise of ransomware has coincided with two other major changes in the cyber black market. The first is the growing amount of leaked attack tools from the U.S. government available online. The second is the growing use of digital currencies, which give hackers an easy and potentially anonymous way to get paid. The malware unleashed Tuesday demands payment of $300 in bitcoin. The reason many ransomware operators ask for relatively small payments is that the amount needs to be low enough that enough people will pay, but high enough that it’s worth the effort to attack. Given the secretive nature of cryptocurrencies and the shadowy world in which cybercriminals operate, it’s virtually impossible to get an accurate read on exactly how much the hackers rake in. Because there’s a glut of credit card and identity data for sale on the black market, it’s gotten harder for criminals to get paid, said Jeremiah Grossman, chief of security strategy for SentinelOne. But rather than try to sell data to a third party, attackers instead encrypt it -- demanding that the victim pay to get it back. ""Who better to value the data than the owner of the data?"" Grossman said. ""It’s market forces at work."" There are signs that hackers are shifting tactics in favor of ransomware. According to a study by IBM, the amount of spam containing ransomware surged to 40 percent by the end of 2016 from just 0.6 percent in 2015. While many ransomware attacks are blocked by security software, the number of infections getting through is growing. Symantec said it detected 463,000 ransomware infections in 2016, 36 percent higher than the year before. But Tuesday’s attack contained some puzzling elements to security experts, raising concerns that it may not have been about payment at all. Like WannaCry, which the U.S. government has reportedly linked to North Korea, the new attack does not have the usual characteristics associated with hackers who want to maintain control of the infected computers and facilitate payment and easy decryption of locked files. That the hardest hit country is Ukraine, whose power grid and other critical systems have been the target of repeated high-level hacking attacks blamed on the Russian government, raised suspicions among some researchers that another motive could be at play. Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the Interior Ministry in Ukraine, wrote on Facebook that the goal appeared to be “the destabilization of the economic situation and in the civic consciousness of Ukraine” even though it was “disguised as an extortion attempt."" ""There’s something weird about this one,"" added SentinelOne’s Grossman. — With assistance by Cory Johnson"
2017-06-30T05:04:27.787Z,"Global Cyberattack Seems Intent on Havoc, Not Extortion",,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-30/global-cyberattack-seems-intent-on-havoc-not-extortion-j4je9o9d,"Paris (AP) -- A cyberattack that caused indiscriminate economic damage around the world was apparently designed to create maximum havoc in Russia's neighbor and adversary Ukraine, security researchers said. While the rogue software used in the attack was configured as extortionate ""ransomware,"" that may have just been a ruse. ""It is clear that this was targeted indiscriminately at Ukrainian businesses, and the Ukrainian government,"" Jake Williams, president of the security firm Rendition Infosec and a former member of the U.S. National Security Agency's elite cyberwarfare group, told The Associated Press in an online chat. ""The 'ransomware' component is just a smokescreen (and a bad one)."" UKRAINE IN PAIN Although the attack was global in its reach, Ukraine bore the brunt. Computers were disabled at banks, government agencies, energy companies, supermarkets, railways and telecommunications providers. Many of these organizations said they had recovered by Thursday, although some experts suspected that work was incomplete. ""There is still a lot of damage, especially in banks,"" said Victor Zhora, CEO of the Kiev cybersecurity firm InfoSafe. ""ATMs are working (again) but some bank operations are still limited."" He estimated damage in ""the millions of dollars, perhaps tens of millions."" And that's just in Ukraine. Microsoft said the malware hit at least 64 nations, including Russia, Germany and the United States. ""I expect that we will see additional fallout from this is the coming days,"" said Williams. In Ukraine, suspicion immediately fell on hackers affiliated with Vladimir Putin's regime, although there is no direct, public evidence tying Russia to the attack. Relations between the two nations have been tense since Moscow annexed the Crimean peninsula from Ukraine in 2014. Pro-Russian fighters are still battling the government in eastern Ukraine. Experts have also blamed pro-Russian hackers for major cyberattacks on the Ukrainian power grid in 2015 and 2016, assaults that have turned the eastern European nation into the world's leading cyberwarfare testing ground. A disruptive attack on the nation's voting system ahead of 2014 national elections is also attributed to Russia. THE MOSCOW CONNECTION The malicious program, which researchers are calling NotPetya, initially appeared to be ransomware. Such malware locks up victims' files by encrypting them, then holds them hostage while demanding payment — usually in bitcoin, the hard-to-trace digital currency. But researchers said the culprits would have been hard-pressed to make money off the scheme. They appear to have relied on a single email address that was blocked almost immediately and a single bitcoin account that collected the relatively puny sum of $10,000. Firms including Russia's anti-virus Kaspersky Lab, said clues in the code indicate that the program's authors would have been incapable of decrypting the data, further evidence that the ransom demands were a smoke screen. The timing was intriguing, too. The attack came the same day as the assassination of a senior Ukrainian military intelligence officer and a day before a national holiday celebrating the new Ukrainian constitution signed after the breakup of the Soviet Union. ""Everything being said so far does point to Russia being a leading candidate for a suspect in this attack,"" said Robert M. Lee, CEO of Dragos Inc. an expert who has studied the attacks on Ukraine's power grid. What's most worrisome and reprehensible, said Lee, is that whoever was behind the attack was unconcerned about the indiscriminate, collateral damage it caused — much of it within Russia itself. That's highly atypical behavior for nation-states. ACCOUNTING FOR MALWARE Williams and other researchers said all evidence indicates that NotPetya was introduced via Ukrainian financial software provider MeDoc. It is one of just two companies in the eastern European nation that supplies required tax software, Zhora said. Security experts believe MeDoc was the unwitting victim of something akin to a ""watering-hole attack,"" where a malicious program surreptitiously planted at a popular destination infects parties that visit. The method was previously uses to infect industrial control systems operators through software updates in a cyberespionage campaign dubbed ""Dragonfly"" that was ""widely attributed to Russia,"" said Williams. MeDoc's user base is heavily financial — and includes multinational corporations with offices in Ukraine. NotPetya was cleverly engineered to spread laterally within Windows networks and across the globe via private network connections. Globally, dozens of major corporations and government agencies have been disrupted, including FedEx subsidiary TNT. Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk, one of the global companies hit hardest, said Thursday that most of its terminals were running again, though some are operating in a limited way or more slowly than usual. Problems have been reported across the shippers' global business, from Mobile, Alabama, to Mumbai in India. At Mumbai's Jawaharlal Nehru Port, several hundred containers could be seen piled up at just two of more than a dozen yards. ""The vessels are coming, the ships are coming, but they are not able to take the container because all the systems are down,"" trading and clearing agent Rajeshree Verma said. ""We are actually in a fix because of all this."" ___ Olsen reported from Copenhagen, Bajak from Houston.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-26/bitcoin-ether-lead-slide-as-digital-currencies-drop-from-highs,"Bitcoin declined as much as 17 percent, while smaller competitor ether continued to slide after experiencing a “flash crash” last week, raising concern about mainstream acceptance of the digital currencies. Bitcoin slumped to as low as $2,255.44 in intraday trading, the least since June 15. Ether, the virtual currency based on the ethereum blockchain, plunged 26 percent to $221.45, according to data compiled by Coindesk.com. And ripple, the third largest digital currency based on market cap, has dropped about 13 percent to around 26 cents, according to prices compiled by CoinMarketCap.com. Ether slumped June 21 after congestion on its network slowed transactions, causing some cryptocurrency exchanges such as Bitfinex and ShapeShift to halt transactions. Coinbase’s GDAX exchange experience a ""flash crash,"" as price slippage sent ether to trade around 10 cents, said GDAX Vice President Adam White, who on Monday decided to reverse an earlier decision not to refund flash-crash victims. He said the crash on GDAX was instigated by a multimillion-dollar market sell order. The two biggest digital currencies have still surged in value this year. Ether started the year around $8, meaning even with its current drop, the price has doubled many times over. Bitcoin has advanced about 150 percent year to date. ""When people fixate on price movements over a single day, my recommendation is zoom out of the price chart and look at the broader trend,"" said Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at Coin Center, a Washington-based nonprofit research firm focusing on cryptocurrencies. ""Blockchain could either catch on as the rails for global finance, or not, so valuations for a digital currency like bitcoin can either go to zero or be worth much more than it is today, so these assets are bound to be very volatile as people’s calculations of what they are worth can be all over the map."" Coinbase was down earlier Monday, according to online forums on ether, which could explain some of the losses, as this comes after other exchanges temporarily suspended trading last week due to a bottleneck on ether orders. Read more on the recent volatility in tech shares The steeper decline in ether than bitcoin means ether’s market cap at $25 billion is now just about 60 percent of bitcoin’s, down from about 80 percent, when ether climbed over $400 two weeks ago. The rapid growth of the ethereum network had prompted speculation that ether would overtake bitcoin to become the biggest cryptocurrency as soon as this year, a phenomenon known as the flippening. Chipmakers that had benefited from cryptocoin miners last week are now giving up some of those gains. Nvidia Corp. dropped for the third consecutive day, slumping 1.1 percent to $152.15 per share. Advanced Micro Devices Inc. dropped 0.6 percent to $14.08."

Nasdaq 100 falls to seven-week low, global hawkish streak roils U.S. dollar, and a full serving of economic data ahead. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. The Nasdaq 100 plunged 1.7 percent to a seven-week low on Thursday as investors rotated into banks, which were cleared by the Fed’s stress test to embark upon massive share repurchase programs. Cheer up: While volatility in tech stocks may have increased, it’s still nowhere close to that of bitcoin. It’s not like the fundamentals are falling apart for the tech giants, either—Facebook announced that it has two billion users (though it has also indicated that ad revenue growth could slow).  Meanwhile, Walgreens’ decision to give up on a takeover of Rite Aid amid anti-trust concerns caused acute pain for a handful of big hedge funds. Hawkish rhetoric from global central bankers has rewritten the script for where interest rates and longer-term yields may be heading across a host of major economies. 10-year bond yields in the U.S., Germany, England, and Canada all marched higher on Thursday, offering little support for investors amid the retreat in risk assets. The high market-implied probability of rate hikes in England and Canada before the year is out has cast the U.S. dollar in the unfamiliar role of laggard in currency markets. The dollar spot index has given back almost 2 percent over the past three sessions, tied for its worst such showing since early 2016. There’s a jam-packed day of data for the Asia-Pacific region to end the week. It’s jobs day in Japan, where the unemployment rate and job-to-applicant ratio are expected to hold steady at 2.8 percent and 1.48, respectively. June headline and core inflation out of Tokyo are projected to tick up to annual paces of 0.3 and 0.2 percent. Readings on vehicle production and housing starts for May are slated to be released in the early afternoon. Across the sea, economists are calling for China’s official manufacturing purchasing managers’ index to moderate slightly to 51 from 51.2, a level that still suggests expansion in the sector. Down under, the rate of monthly private sector credit growth in Australia is expected to hold steady at 0.4 percent in May. First up for the region, however, is South Korea’s May reading of industrial production at 8:00 a.m. Tokyo time, forecast to rise 1.1 percent month on month after a 2.2 percent decline. The Trump administration's restrictions on refugees and visitors from six Muslim-majority countries with will go into effect on Thursday night in the U.S., with officials predicting an orderly rollout. A Supreme Court decision earlier this week partly revived the travel ban, which had been blocked by lower courts. The onus was on federal agencies to figure out what constitutes a “bona fide” connection to the U.S., a status that exempts travelers from the restrictions. Some but not all family members of people living in the U.S. qualify for exemption, as well as businesspeople who have had a formal, documented relationship with U.S. parties. S&P/ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 futures are well in the red as of 5:30 a.m. Tokyo time. Meanwhile, China’s yuan, whose weakness was the market’s biggest irritant not too long ago, is on track for its best quarterly performance since 2010 amid speculation of at least three episodic interventions from the People’s Bank of China to prop it up in June. However, a former foreign-exchange regulator is warning that there’s still much more progress needed for the currency to become stable. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

Anthony Murgio, 33, admitted in January that he ran Coin.mx for Gery Shalon, the self-described founder of a sprawling criminal enterprise that hacked at least nine companies including JPMorgan Chase & Co., E*Trade Financial Corp. and Dow Jones & Co. Prosecutors said the unregistered business sold bitcoins that were used in illegal online transactions and as payment in ransomware attacks. ""I screwed up badly and made serious mistakes and misjudgments,"" a weeping Murgio told U.S. District Judge Alison J. Nathan at his sentencing in Manhattan Tuesday. Nathan set a Sept. 1 hearing to determine the amount of forfeiture, fines and restitution Murgio must pay. He remains free on bail. Shalon’s global network allegedly stole information on more than 100 million customers of banks and publishing firms and generated hundreds of millions of dollars in illicit proceeds from pump-and-dump stock scams and online gambling. Murgio was among those accused of trading cash for bitcoins on behalf of ransomware victims as well as helping to take over a New Jersey credit union that sought to hide transactions from law enforcement and banking authorities. JPMorgan’s 2014 Hack Tied to Vast Cybercrime Enterprise Even with the 5 1/2-year sentence, Murgio will serve less time than prosecutors wanted. He pleaded guilty to three counts of conspiracy, for which prosecutors sought a term of 10 years to 12 years and seven months behind bars. Nathan declined to follow the recommended sentencing guidelines and ordered a prison stay that was half as long. Murgio’s father, Michael, pleaded guilty in October to conspiring to obstruct the examination of a federal financial institution and received one year of probation. Michael Murgio and other members of his family were in the courtroom as Anthony was sentenced. Shalon and his alleged top lieutenant, Ziv Orenstein, were arrested at their homes in Israel in July 2015 and extradited to the U.S. last year. They have pleaded not guilty. An American who allegedly conspired with them, Joshua Aaron, who attended Florida State University with Anthony Murgio, was detained by Russian authorities in 2015 and returned to the U.S. in December to face charges.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/rise-of-digital-coins-has-central-banks-considering-e-versions,"In a world were financial transactions are largely electronic, central banks are exploring the idea of using virtual currencies, even as cyberattacks and price swings dominate the headlines. ""The central bank digital currency would be like a paper bill except digital,"" Dartmouth College economics professor Andrew Levin said in an interview on Bloomberg Television. For example, ""it would be representing a U.S. dollar, but it would be basically free to use."" Whereas credit cards charge transaction fees and interest, and paper currencies can be costly to process, digital currencies could be a ""real benefit"" to small businesses and consumers, Levin said. Central banks from across Europe and Asia are looking into virtual currencies. In March, Vietnam’s central bank said it was ""seriously"" studying the possibility of using bitcoin. The People’s Bank of China has run trials of its prototype cryptocurrency, and the Danish central bank is considering minting e-krone. But Federal Reserve Board Governor Jerome Powell said in March the U.S. central bank is not considering a digital currency. For a replay of the inaugural Bitcoin Facebook Live show launched yesterday. Skeptics have questioned whether one of the key features of cryptocurrencies -- their decentralized nature -- makes them a good fit for central banks. But in a recent proposal published by Levin and Rutgers University economics professor Michael Bordo, the pair said central banks could provide a secure store of value in their own digital currency. ""In contrast to bitcoin, the value of the central bank’s digital currency would be fixed in nominal terms,"" Levin and Bordo wrote. ""Moreover, the central bank’s digital currency could be implemented using an account-based system, thereby avoiding the resource-consuming ‘mining’ operations involved in generating virtual currencies like bitcoin."" — With assistance by Joe Weisenthal"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-15/how-ransomware-works-and-avoiding-the-next-attack-quicktake-q-a,"An increasingly popular and disruptive form of cybercrime is ransomware, which makes files and data stored on computers inaccessible unless a fee is paid. Once a niche area for hackers, the attacks are now affecting government agencies and some of the world’s biggest corporations. Companies hit in 2017 included A.P. Moller-Maersk, FedEx Corp., Nissan Motor Co., Russia’s largest oil producer Rosneft and advertising giant WPP Plc. The U.K. National Health Service and a number of Ukrainian agencies were also harmed. With sophisticated ransomware software available online for hackers to use and the rise of anonymous digital currencies such as bitcoin, there are fears the attacks will only continue. It’s a form of malicious software, “malware” for short, that essentially holds a device hostage until a fee is paid to restore it to normal. In the case of the WannaCry worm in May, the ransom was $300 in bitcoin, payable within 72 hours. In June, a South Korean web hosting company agreed to pay more than $1 million to unlock its servers, the largest known payout. The virus spreads from machine to machine on a network, often via email attachments from rogue senders. The targets are usually older computer operating systems that have not been properly maintained with up-to-date security software. Typically one of two things: Either you restore your files from a backup, or you lose them forever. Hackers often give victims a deadline -- say 72 hours to pay the $300 in bitcoin; after that, the price doubles. If the targets refuse to pay, their computers will be permanently locked -- a serious problem for people who haven’t backed up their data. The identity of the hackers is hard to learn because they can act anonymously online and the ransom is paid with digital currencies. But the most recent forms of ransomware used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency, and affected computers running on older versions of Microsoft Corp.’s operating system. The simple answer is that it’s expensive to keep operating systems with the best security up to date. Microsoft issued a security patch in March that it labeled “critical,” but many users of personal computers either couldn’t or didn’t download it. Machines still running the long-outdated Windows XP are even more at risk, since Microsoft ended support for that several years ago. An organization with hundreds or thousands of computers would need to spend a lot of money to upgrade all of their systems. When budgets are limited and no problems are occurring, performing costly upgrades is often considered a lower priority. Another reason is software compatibility. Many companies use bespoke software that was designed many years ago and which is incompatible with modern computer operating systems. Keeping hold of those old, vulnerable systems may be preferable than rewriting or upgrading. Hackers make the ransom small enough that companies may conclude it’s cheaper to pay it than to hire expensive specialist teams to restore their data. The low cost, combined with the threat of doubling after three days, may have felt to the perpetrators like the most practical way to get paid. You can purchase bitcoin via a broker or specialist exchange. There are many available online for use with numerous currencies. Once the money has been verified and transferred from a bank to the exchange, the user is granted a bitcoin or fraction of a bitcoin in a digital wallet, which can then be sent anonymously to any other registered wallet. Maybe. Some government agencies perform forensics on bitcoin purchases to try to learn more about the perpetrators. But the tools aren’t likely to lead to a particular person or group unless the money is touched or withdrawn. Some experts believe withdrawal might not happen, since the world’s cyber-intelligence forces will be watching the bitcoin account for any sign of activity. The perpetrators may choose to leave the money and count their losses, but remain anonymous. It’s perhaps more likely that clues within the malware itself will provide more intelligence on the identities or location of the attackers. Yes. And experts believe it will. It’s not difficult for an attacker to alter the code of this malware in order to deploy it once more, although the threat of such action may motivate companies and individuals to protect themselves better, thereby reducing the potential damage, and appeal, of a repeat attack. The advice of some security specialists is simple: Don’t pay the ransom -- it just encourages copycats. The most effective form of prevention -- for businesses or individuals -- is to back up files. If data is backed up regularly to an external source, a computer can be reset to its factory settings and then the backed-up files can be reinstalled, essentially wiping the ransomware from the system. Ransomware worms are easy for hackers to modify so even if a fix is found for one bug it won’t necessarily safeguard against a future attack.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/cyberattack-reaches-asia-as-new-targets-hit-by-ransomware-demand,"A cyberattack similar to WannaCry entered its second day, hitting businesses, port operators and government systems around the world, with companies struggling to retake control of their networks. A.P. Moller-Maersk A/S shut down systems across its operations to contain the cyberattack against its computer network as it assesses the full impact. Global snack giant Mondelez International Inc. also experienced a widespread IT outage and shut down its email system as a precaution against further exposure, forcing employees to work via cellphones, text messages and personal email. Other companies including France’s BNP Paribas SA, U.K. advertising giant WPP Plc and Hamburg-based Beiersdorf AG, the maker of Nivea and Labello lip balm, were also coping with the fallout. The cyberattack began in Ukraine Tuesday, infecting computer networks and demanding $300 in cryptocurrency to unlock their systems. As of Midday Tuesday in North America, Kaspersky Lab analysts said about 2,000 users had been attacked. “Our portal is down and we are not able to take on new orders until we get it back up,” Maersk Line Chief Commercial Officer Vincent Clerc said by phone, declining to say when systems would return to normal. “We’re being very cautious to ensure that as we bring the applications back up, the attack is contained and rolled back. It limits the accessibility we have at the moment.” A terminal operated by Maersk at the Jawaharlal Nehru Port Trust, a facility near Mumbai, which is India’s biggest container port, was unable to load or unload shipments because of the attack. With the Gateway Terminal India facility unable to identify which shipment belongs to whom, the port is clearing cargo manually, Chairman Anil Diggikar said. “With there being no global kill switch for this one, we’ll continue to see the numbers rise in different parts of the world as more vulnerable systems become more exposed,” said Beau Woods, deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington. The attacks had a limited impact in Asia. While there were early signs the virus was starting to spread in China, no large-scale outbreak was detected, according to Zheng Wenbin, chief security engineer at Qihoo 360 Technology Co. After the WannaCry outbreak earlier this year, ransomware is becoming a routine risk for businesses around the world. While banks and retailers have strengthened defenses against certain types of attacks, such as those targeting credit card data, many others are still catching up in building their defenses. However, unlike traditional forms of ransomware, which often provide secure forms of payment in order to release control of networks, the new hack has seemingly concentrated on crippling systems, rather than obtaining a ransom. The email address posted on users’ locked screen, used by victims to receive decryption keys, was easily and swiftly shut down by the email provider. ""If it is a ransomware campaign to make money it doesn’t add up,"" Raj Samani, chief scientist at McAfee, a cybersecurity company owned by Intel Corp., said. He said there were many elements of the attack that made it look like the perpetrators did not actually care all that much about receiving payments. Read more: A QuickTake Q&A on how ransomware works Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, Russia’s largest crude producer, said it avoided “serious consequences” from the “hacker attack” by switching to a backup system for managing production processes, however some cash registers failed due to the attacks. U.K. media company WPP’s website was knocked offline, and employees were told to turn off their computers and not use Wi-Fi, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sea Containers, the London building that houses WPP and agencies including Ogilvy & Mather, was been shut down Tuesday, another person said, and workers Wednesday were encouraged to work from home and avoid logging into the central network.  Law firm DLA Piper took down its systems as a “precautionary measure,” meaning clients couldn’t contact its team by email or land-line, according to a notice on its website. The most vulnerable places are “where the operators are a lot of the times at the mercy of manufacturers and providers of those technologies and there’s a long time between existence of a fix and implementation of a fix,” Woods said. Maersk said its customers can’t use online booking tools and its internal systems are down. Diggikar said 75 Maersk group terminals were hit by the attack. APM Terminals, owned by Maersk, at the Port of New York and New Jersey closed Tuesday “due to the extent of the system impact,” the Port said. Cie de Saint-Gobain, a French manufacturer, said its systems had also been infected, though a spokeswoman declined to elaborate. Merck & Co. Inc., based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, reported that its computer network was compromised due to the hack. At BNP Paribas, the attack was stopped from spreading outside the property development and management unit, a spokeswoman for the French banking group said. The strikes follow the global ransomware assault involving WannaCry virus that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries as extortionists demanded bitcoin from victims. Ransomware attacks have been soaring and the number of such incidents increased by 50 percent in 2016, according to Verizon Communications Inc.  The attack popped up in government systems in Kiev, then disabled operations at companies including Rosneft PJSC and the Chernobyl nuclear facility. More than 80 companies in Russia and Ukraine were initially affected, Moscow-based cybersecurity company Group-IB said Tuesday. The hack quickly spread through Europe and into the U.S. Microsoft Corp., cybersecurity analysts, and Ukrainian police said the global hack could be traced to a Ukrainian accounting software producer. “While this attack directly impacts IT systems, we must consider how the ransomware threat will evolve in the near future to also impact IoT devices and connected cars,” said Mark Hearn, who is director of Internet of Things security at Irdeto. Analysts at Symantec Corp., have said the new virus -- initially branded Petya -- uses an exploit called EternalBlue to spread, much like WannaCry. EternalBlue works on vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Windows operating system. — With assistance by Volodymyr Verbyany, Stepan Kravchenko, Yuan Gao, Kyunghee Park, Jeremy Kahn, Dhwani Pandya, and Craig Giammona"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/latest-hack-may-be-about-disruption-not-money-experts-say,"The cyberattack that has hit businesses and governments across Europe, Latin America and Asia is similar to last month’s WannaCry attack in more ways than simply the method used to spread across computer networks. Like WannaCry, this attack looks like ransomware, but probably isn’t, security experts say. Raj Samani, chief scientist at cybersecurity company McAfee, which is owned by Intel Inc., says that unlike ransomware used by hackers for financial gain, these latest cyberattacks seem designed primarily to sow disruption. “This one is ransomware in name but destructive in nature,” he says. Adam Meyers, vice president of intelligence at cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike concurs, saying it was striking that the attackers asked for payment to be sent to a sole email address. Ransomware encrypts data on an affected computer. The hacker then extorts money from the computer’s owner -- usually in bitcoin -- for a decryption key. WannaCry and this most recent attack did the same, but in this case it encrypted an infected machine in a way that makes decryption difficult, Samani says. “It is there to be disruptive.” David Palmer, director of technology at U.K. cybersecurity company Darktrace, says if this was ransomware, it was hard to reconcile with the ingenious design of the attack. It spread through what appeared to be a legitimate accounting software patch and then used multiple stealthy techniques, including stealing login credentials, to infect other machines on a network with little thought about how the perpetrators would actually get paid. The attackers asked for payment to be sent in bitcoin to just one email address, supplied by an email service called Posteo. Once Posteo was made aware that one of its addresses was being used in the attack, it was shut down. “In the past, criminals behind these attacks were trying to make it as easy as possible for victims to pay the ransom,” Palmer says. “That isn’t the case here. The ransom approach is completely backward to the way ransomware has evolved in the last several years.” Palmer also says this malware didn’t merely encrypt data on an infected machine, it essentially destroyed it by scrambling the data and then overwriting it. “This will make it very hard for most organizations to undo the damage without some good, recent backups,” he says."

Fed officials talk equities, Draghi lights a fire under the euro and yields, and U.S. tech stocks tumble. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. A trio of Fed officials delivered remarks on Tuesday, and the state of financial markets were front and center. In a television interview in Australia, San Francisco Fed President John Williams said the U.S. stock market ""seems to be running very much on fumes"" and that he was ""somewhat concerned about the complacency in the market."" In a speech in Washington, Fed Vice-Chair Stan Fischer suggested that there had been a ""notable uptick"" in risk appetite that propelled valuation ratios to very elevated levels. Fed Chair Janet Yellen took a more measured view, opining that asset valuations look ""somewhat rich"" but that traditional metrics depend on long term interest rates, which are expected to stay below historical norms.  A turn of phrase from European Central Bank President Mario Draghi at a forum in Portugal Tuesday spurred traders to believe policy normalization is coming sooner rather than later. Draghi's reference to the emergence of ""reflationary forces"" contributed to the worst loss for German bonds since 2015, while the euro was the second best G10 currency on the day. Separately, Bank of England Governor Mark Carney warned that the central bank plans to increase capital requirements for the nation's lenders in a bid to safeguard the financial system following a pick-up in credit growth. On Wednesday, a star-studded central banking panel including Carney and Draghi (as well as Bank of Canada Governor Stephen Poloz and Bank of Japan Governor Haruhiko Kuroda) will take place on the third day of the ECB's forum. The Nasdaq 100 Index fell 1.8 percent Tuesday, with weakness in tech shares also contributing to a retreat in the S&P 500 Index. The CBOE Volatility Index jumped to above 11 amid signs that institutions are buying protection to hedge against a major stock selloff. Meanwhile, West Texas Intermediate futures managed to post their fourth consecutive gain, breaking above $44 per barrel. Another major ransomware attack is afflicting a host of companies around the world, including Rosneft PJSC and the shuttered Chernobyl nuclear facility. Victims are being instructed to pay $300 in cryptocurrency to restore access to their devices. Bitcoin bull Michael Novogratz suggested that cryptocurrencies could be worth more than $5 trillion in five years, unfazed by any association the asset class could have with the cyberattacks.  Nikkei 225 futures are flat ahead of the open, while S&P/ASX 200 futures are in the red as of 6 a.m. Tokyo time. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index was mixed Tuesday ahead of a heavy calendar of Fedspeak, while a sharp selloff in Hong Kong small caps was attributed to links between some of the firms and a brokerage facing a regulatory probe. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-30/mishaps-blue-aprons-and-greenshoes,"Martin Shkreli! This seems bad: What kind of operational mishaps can a hedge fund go through between 8:13 p.m. and 8:44 p.m.? U.S. markets are closed; things are usually pretty quiet. The obvious operational mishap is that the hedge fund manager -- ""Pharma Bro"" Martin Shkreli -- could have stolen the money, and he is indeed on trial for fraud in federal criminal court. But even if that was the explanation, to go from up 45 percent to down 100 percent in the course of 31 minutes one evening, and get an email about it, is pretty unusual. Fraudsters don't normally email you promptly when their fraud is complete. But here is the critical follow-up to Sarah Hassan's tale of woe: Like Shkreli's other investors, she complained about the disappearing money, and Shkreli compensated her with shares of Retrophin Inc., the pharmaceutical company he had founded. So she got back 10 times her investment! When Shkreli was first arrested, I wrote about it with the headline ""Martin Shkreli Accused of Being Surprisingly Good at Fraud."" Not a lot of securities frauds end with everyone better off. The prosecutors' theory in the Shkreli case, in a nutshell, is that Shkreli started a hedge fund, lost all the money, lied about it, started another hedge fund (the one Hassan invested in), lost all the money, lied about it, started a pharmaceutical company (Retrophin), had enormous and sustained success (it is currently worth about $740 million), and took money from Retrophin under false pretenses to pay off the hedge-fund investors he had ripped off. There are a lot of victims there -- the hedge-fund investors were allegedly deceived, and Retrophin, a public company, was allegedly looted -- but one fact that unites those victims is that Shkreli has made them all much richer than they would have been. It is not precisely an airtight legal defense to fraud charges, but you can kind of see where he's coming from. Blue Apron.  Yesterday, like an idiot, I predicted that Blue Apron Holdings Inc.'s stock would probably move a lot when it opened on its first day of trading: Blue Apron launched its initial public offering at a price range of $15-$17 per share, cut the range to $10-$11, and ended up pricing on Wednesday at $10, suggesting that there's a lot of uncertainty about its value. So you'd think -- I thought -- that its first day of market trading would be a bit wild. But, no, it closed at $10.00 exactly. (It got as high as $11.00 in the morning, and even that is not much of an IPO pop.) I must say it is kind of amazing that Blue Apron's underwriters were waaaaaaaaaay off on their first attempt to price the company ($15-$17), but then got it exactly right -- down to the penny -- on their second effort. The system works! I mean, heh, no. For one thing, IPOs really are supposed to go up: If Blue Apron closed yesterday at $17, the company would probably be annoyed about cutting the price, but an $11 or $12 close would be nice, a good sign of investor enthusiasm for the stock and a modest reward for the investors who took a chance by buying in the IPO. For another thing, that $10.00 price is probably not a coincidence: Blue Apron traded between $10.00 and $10.05 for the last 20 minutes of trading yesterday, which suggests that its underwriters were eating through some of the greenshoe in order to support the price. (Remember: When Blue Apron went public, it sold 30 million shares to the underwriters, but the underwriters sold 34.5 million shares to investors, leaving them short 4.5 million shares. They also got an option from Blue Apron to buy those 4.5 million shares at the offering price. The deal is that if the price drops to or below $10, the underwriters will buy in some of their short in the market to support the price; if it stays above $10, they will exercise the ""greenshoe"" option and buy the extra 4.5 million shares directly from the company.) Without that stabilization by the underwriters, the stock might well have closed below the IPO price. (And in fact the stock ""traded as low as $9.95 in late trading in New York."") This is particularly awkward because Blue Apron is going to need more money: If you are going to come back to the equity markets a year after your IPO, it does help if your IPO investors have made some money. Citi spoofers. We have talked before about Treasury-futures spoofing at Citigroup Global Markets Inc., for which Citi agreed to pay a $25 million fine to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission on the basis of some pretty silly anecdotes about how Citi's New York traders trained its junior traders in Tokyo in how to spoof, but did not do a very good job. Well yesterday the CFTC announced non-prosecution agreements with three of those traders, and provided some more silly anecdotes about Citi's lackadaisical spoofing training program: I love that, on Citi's Treasuries desk, getting ""jacked"" on a failed spoofing attempt was a rite of passage. ""Hey, Bob, hop on my line, Dan in Tokyo got lifted on a spoof order!"" ""Hahahahaha welcome to the club Danny boy!"" You know how bond traders will romanticize the shady behavior of the ""Liar's Poker"" era forever? (The way stock traders have romanticized the shady behavior of the Jesse Livermore era forever?) I feel like we are already, in 2017, in a place of nostalgia for 2012, back when dinosaurs roamed the Treasury markets, spoofing with impunity. Well, not impunity, but that's what they thought anyway. Home Capital. Home Capital Group Inc. was a struggling Canadian mortgage lender, but then Warren Buffett agreed to give it a C$2 billion credit line and buy up to C$400 million of stock at a big discount, and now everything is fine: ""The stock has since soared to C$17, more than triple its May lows when the company faced a run on cash following allegations it misled investors about fraud on some mortgage applications."" And so Home Capital shareholders are having second thoughts about actually giving Buffett the stock at a discount: Buffett has already bought 19.99 percent of the company at C$9.55 per share, but the second tranche of his planned purchase -- another 18.4 percent at $10.30 per share -- requires shareholder approval, and the shareholders are getting restless.  It's like the Jerry Seinfeld joke about getting the check at the end of a meal at a restaurant: ""We're not hungry now, why are we buying all this food?"" The benefit from having Warren Buffett invest in Home Capital, for Home Capital, comes from announcing that Warren Buffett has bought a bunch of shares. But once you have that benefit, why give him the shares? As at a restaurant, this reasoning is not bulletproof: The reason Buffett was willing to come to Home Capital's rescue in the first place was that they promised him a bunch of discounted shares. But, for shareholder-voting-requirement reasons, they could only really promise him the first 19.99 percent, and the investment wasn't contingent on the second tranche going through. So the shareholders are not wrong: If you don't need to give Buffett a huge chunk of discounted shares to get the benefit of his rescue, why do it? Elsewhere in Buffett rescues: ""Buffett to Swap $5 Billion BofA Stake for $17 Billion of Stock."" Berkshire Hathaway Inc. bought $5 billion of Bank of America Corp. preferred stock in 2011, which came with warrants to swap the preferred into common at $7.14 per share. The stock closed yesterday at $24.32 per share. Bank of America shareholders don't get to vote on whether they'd like to change their minds. Avocado toast. An unfortunate fact of financial life in 2017 is that there is an inextricable link between housing finance and avocado toast. This started last month with an ""Australian millionaire and real estate mogul"" who had ""advice for millennials struggling to purchase a home: stop buying avocado toast,"" and since then has become such a meme that now, ugh, this is happening: ""Instagram filter optional,"" Social Finance Inc. adds; I recommend Reyes to really bring out the wan disappointment of receiving a loaf of bread and a bag of avocados. That is not avocado toast. It is just a dim gesture at a never-all-that-interesting meme. Concepts like ""millennials,"" ""homes"" and ""avocado toast"" burble lazily in some marketer's mind, and so they lazily hand you a loaf of bread, a bunch of avocados and a mortgage. I hope you like it! ""SoFi is so cool that they'll mail you an egregious misunderstanding of avocado toast for the low, low price of buying a home,"" tweets Bloomberg's Annie Massa.  Meanwhile! In London!  Meanwhile! At Square Inc.! Square is advising millennials to make money by selling avocado toast, perhaps so they can buy homes? There is an obvious levered avocado-fintech play here: Borrow money from SoFi, get free avocados and bread, toast the bread, put the avocados on it, sell the avocado toast at $7 a piece, take payments via Square, and use the proceeds for a down payment. ""You'll still need to toast the bread yourself,"" but perhaps if you open an account at a traditional bank they will give you a toaster. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. ""Pay your Ferrari with Bitcoin,"" says the press release in my inbox, and why not. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. You know, this section is usually about people complaining that the VIX is too low, but the general worry that people aren't worried enough is a core feature of financial markets and financial life and life in general, really. So here is ""All-Clear for Big Banks Raises Fears of a Return to Risk"": People are worried that, since all the banks passed the Federal Reserve's stress tests and will be allowed to return capital to shareholders, the banks will become too risky. People are worried, that is, that people aren't worried enough about the banks: Because the stress tests found that the banks are safe, the banks will become risky. But of course if banks had failed the stress tests then that would mean that they were already risky. There is no way to win. You can't make fun of this thinking too much, because it is probably right: When things are risky, they are risky, and when things are not risky, then people are becoming complacent and allowing risks to build up in the system. It is a Minskyan inevitability; there really is no way to win. The only consolation is that markets keep going up over the long term. People are worried about unicorns. Here is a brief story about how Uber Technologies Inc. ""has held multiple meetings with the SEC about how it can provide equity to its drivers, who are contractors rather than employees."" The issue is that if you give securities to enough people, particularly if those people are not employees, then you might have to register with the Securities and Exchange Commission and go public without meaning to. One trick that some private companies use is to give employees some sort of phantom equity in the form of profit-sharing, but this is difficult for Uber because, you know, no profits. Another trick would be to make the drivers employees, but Uber seems to have a philosophical aversion to that. What's left? I don't know, initial coin offerings seem to be all the rage in the world of blockchain. The idea of an ICO is that a platform company sets up an electronic token to serve as a unit of currency on its platform, and then sells some of those tokens to the public to establish their value and let people speculate on the future of the platform. So for instance if you had to pay for Uber rides with Ubercoins, then there would be a market for Ubercoins. And Uber drivers would be paid in Ubercoins, which they could then convert into cash -- or which they could keep, if they think that the value of the Uber platform (and the Ubercoins) will go up. It is another form of shadow equity, but it is also at least arguably not a security. Even leaving aside that Uber is not going to introduce its own currency, this scheme does not seem especially practical. Speculators who wanted to bet on Uber's future growth would push up the price of Ubercoins, which would make drivers richer but would also make Uber rides more expensive, reducing Uber's future growth. Plus I feel like if Uber explained this scheme to the SEC, they might not agree that the Ubercoins are not securities. Me yesterday. Yesterday's Money Stuff argued that ""a useful way to think about the U.S. tax system is that it is designed for the entertainment of tax lawyers,"" and Rob Terrin reminded me of a passage from David Graeber's ""Utopia of Rules"": The children who are especially good at that form of play grow up to be tax lawyers. Also, yesterday I referred to a maximum on a graph as an ""inflection point,"" which is a horrible error of usage, and I apologize. Things happen.

2017-06-29T11:36:34.143Z,The Russian Trail in the Latest 'Ransomware' Attack,"Leonid Bershidsky
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-29/the-russian-trail-in-the-latest-ransomware-attack,"It's almost a reflex to blame Russians for cyberattacks these days, even on the sketchiest of evidence. But such accusations certainly seem justified regarding the novel ransomware attack that has swept the world in recent days -- known as notPetya, exPetr, Petrwrap and several other names referring to its similarity to the well-known Petya ransomware.   On April 28, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko introduced sanctions against a number of Russian companies, including the hugely popular social network Vkontakte and the near-indispensable accounting software developer 1C. The latter was a huge blow to Ukrainian accountants, especially those working for small and medium-sized businesses. 1C, built from scratch by Russian Boris Nuraliev, who is now a billionaire, is established throughout the former Soviet Union because it has made a point of understanding and integrating the vagaries of each country's accounting rules while keeping its software basic, reliable and easy to use for someone without any information technology competence. It also worked as a cheap alternative to sophisticated enterprise resource planning software like that from German vendor SAP. Ukrainian business publications filled with articles on ""how to replace 1C,"" used by some 300,000 local firms. Many of these mentioned M.E. Doc -- a Ukrainian software package that had the advantage of being one of two programs authorized by the Ukrainian tax service for the filing of electronic returns. It's with the M.E. Doc software that the exPetr virus attack originated, according to Microsoft (whose software's vulnerability the virus exploited), Ukrainian cyberpolice and the cybersecurity company Kaspersky. The malware was apparently embedded in an automatic update to the accounting package. That's why the infection spread disproportionately in Ukraine, hitting airports, railroads, large banks, mobile operators, energy companies, government offices, even the decommissioned Chernobyl nuclear plant, where technicians monitoring it had to switch to manual radiation control.  The malware rebooted computers and displayed a red screen telling the victims to pay $300 in Bitcoin to have all their files decrypted. It transpired soon that the malware's developers didn't really want the money. There was a single email address specified for contact with the hackers, but it was soon blocked by the service provider, as usually happens in these cases. Besides, it turned out that the virus encrypted the victims' hard disks without the possibility of recovery. That's odd: An attacker who wanted money would have taken care he could receive it, or at least would have demonstrated his ability to decrypt the files. So cui bono; who benefits from this? Ukrainian officials were quick to accuse Russia of waging cyberwarfare against their country -- but that's almost white noise these days, coming from Kiev, and many observers were confused by the malware's seeming geographic indifference. It hit large Russian companies, too -- the state-oil giant Rosneft and the giant steelmaker Evraz, among others.  That, however, was likely collateral damage. Evraz owns a large Ukrainian coking coal producer. Rosneft sold most of its Ukrainian assets last year, but a map on its website shows it still has an operation in Ukraine. The global shipping firm Maersk, one of the biggest victims of the attack, has a Ukrainian presence, too. It has posted a job listing for an economist with M.E. Doc skills.  On Wednesday, Vesti, the news program on Russian state television, reported that ""the virus had such a field day in Ukraine because of the ban on Russia's 1C."" Other Russian propaganda outlets carried this version, too. It would fit the snarky style of President Vladimir Putin's Kremlin to launch such a mocking attack on Ukraine using a vulnerability that had long been exploited by the U.S. National Security Agency, until it was stolen and published by a hacker collective calling itself Shadow Brokers. Proof will be hard to come by, but even Russian cybersecurity experts don't see what happened as an ordinary ransomware attack. ""This is a test of a certain digital weapon, a training exercise of a cyberarmy with concealed attribution,"" Ilya Sachkov, head of Group-IB, one of Russia's biggest cybersecurity companies, told Hacker magazine, while admitting he had no specific proof. ""The goal would be how much damage could be inflicted on business and how people would react."" On Wednesday, North Atlantic Treaty Organization Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said NATO had decided a cyberattack could trigger Article 5 of the treaty, which calls on member states to come to the defense of a country that's being attacked. That, however, is an empty threat until countries learn to attribute attacks like the exPetr one with more certainty, and until common capabilities are in place to analyze and defeat such threats. In this particular case, as in some others around the world, circumstantial evidence points to Russian involvement, and the private cybersecurity community is happy to discuss it, but governments -- even the Ukrainian one, long aware of the cyberthreat across the border -- have proved helpless and slow to react.

2017-06-27T15:51:22.860Z,Bitcoin Bull Novogratz Unfazed as Cyberattacks Resume Globally,"Camila Russo
         & Simone Foxman
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/novogratz-says-cryptocurrencies-face-monster-regulatory-risks,"Michael Novogratz says cryptocurrencies could be worth north of $5 trillion in five years -- if the industry can come out of the shadows.  “The Nasdaq got to $5.4 trillion in 1999, why couldn’t it be as big?” the former hedge fund manager said in an interview, referring the Nasdaq Composite Index. “There’s so much human capital and real money being poured into the space and we’re at the takeoff point.” To get there, though, companies need to develop sound business principles to satisfy regulators and lend legitimacy to the budding industry, one of Wall Street’s biggest bitcoin bulls said Tuesday at the CB Insights Future of Fintech conference in New York. That’s proving an uphill battle amid Bitcoin’s growing reputation as a currency favored by black marketeers and hackers. The industry took another reputational hit Tuesday after a cyberattack spread around the world, disabling computers and demanding users pay $300 in cryptocurrency to unlock them. It follows the WannaCry hack in May. While bitcoin was little changed at $2,339.66 as of 2 p.m. in New York, some chipmakers whose products are used in mining the cryptocurrency also retreated. The PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF, known as HACK, erased earlier gains to trade little changed. Bitcoin, the biggest cryptocurrency, is up more than 140 percent this year, and ether, the digital asset based on the ethereum blockchain, has surged to about $240 from just $8 at the beginning of the year. The cyberattack comes after questions about the sustainability of this year’s rally and the scaleability of the digital assets had already been dragging down prices. The recent selloff has shrunk cryptocurrencies’ total market cap to about $90 billion from a high of over $110 billion, according to Coinmarketcap.com. For more on the latest cyberattack hitting port operators. Novogratz said he took some profits on his bitcoin and ether holdings as prices surged, but still has 10 percent of his net worth invested in the sector, including blockchain-based assets he bought in fundraising mechanisms known as initial coin offerings. He’s looking to add more ether if it falls between $200 and $150, and more bitcoin if it falls to $2,000. Bitcoin could become a viable store of wealth, similar to gold, while ethereum could be the platform underpinning the Googles and Facebooks of the future, while money transfers to securities settlement will probably be done using blockchain technology, he said. Novogratz, who has spoken about investments in bitcoin since 2013 and formerly managed Fortress Investment Group LLC’s liquid strategies business, has been one of the most prominent supporters of cryptocurrencies on Wall Street. Companies need to develop sound business principles to satisfy regulators and lend legitimacy to the budding industry, he said. ""Pay your taxes, because nobody in that space pays taxes. It’s a bunch of libertarians,"" he said, adding he thought a core group of developers have good intentions. ""There really is a revolutionary spirit amongst the guys that are building this system."" — With assistance by Alexandria Arnold"
2017-06-28T20:00:21.225Z,Bring on the ICOs,"Tim Culpan
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/cryptocoins-are-the-new-penny-stocks-and-that-s-a-good-thing,"Initial Coin Offering. It's a term deliciously similar to those three letters guaranteed to make bankers, investors and founders salivate: IPO. For the most part, bankers have been cut out of the ICO equation -- almost by design -- but founders are loving the notion that you can launch your own cryptocoin, and a growing number of investors are excited about the prospects for huge windfalls. ICOs are so similar to penny stocks that the investing strategy looks almost the same: Throw a few dollars at a low-value security and hope that a bit of hype will see its price go up by astronomical multiples. Here's how it works. A founder comes up with a new cryptocoin and pre-sells an amount to investors prior to launch. They may swap these digital tokens for fiat money, such as U.S. dollars, but are more likely to do so for an established cryptocurrency like bitcoin or ethereum. This early investment not only funds development but helps kick-start the coin's circulation, because a currency isn't very useful if it all sits in the wallets of just a few people. In many cases, founders are developing a real service that's usually linked to the crypto ecosystem, such as a new decentralized exchange, and the coin will become the transactional currency for that product. Others are little more than a lottery. The actual project is spelled out in a white paper, similar to a prospectus. As with penny stocks, investors in ICOs are betting on one of two things: that the underlying company or project becomes a sustainable venture, thus making the coin it uses a sought-after commodity. Alternatively, enough hype is created around the future prospects of the venture, or its coin, that others want to buy in, bidding up the price and allowing earlier investors to exit at a profit. If the project fails, or no one really believes that anyone else will want the coin, then it could quickly become worthless. But ICOs aren't selling securities: Investors are getting neither equity in the venture, nor a promise of some future cashflow (i.e., debt). This fact has helped the crypto community dodge financial regulators. Working in the ICOs' favor is the fact that the phenomenon has so far been the domain of crypto geeks, libertarians and sophisticated investors. While counter-intuitive, I would argue that keeping this circle tight is in the crypto community's best interests, for now. A ridiculous number of speculative new coins have hit the market -- including at least 67 in the past month -- and the vast majority will fail, which means losses for investors. But this try-and-fail process needs to happen in order to shake out the wheat from the chaff so that we can truly understand which blockchain models work, and which don't. Within the safety of this sandbox we'll be able to test whether the world really needs a blockchain lottery, whether a decentralized exchange provides enough value to justify the transaction fees, or whether cryptocoin truly is the future of in-game currency. Let there be no doubt that these are the Wild West days of crypto -- a domain that's unsuitable for mom and pop investors. But when the dust settles this new economy may be more robust than ever.

2017-06-28T14:59:14.203Z,Don't Want Your Cyber Attacked? Move to the Cloud,"Elaine Ou
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-28/don-t-want-your-cyber-attacked-move-to-the-cloud,"Malware has yet again disrupted businesses around the world, just weeks after hackers used leaked National Security Administration tools in a global cyberattack called WannaCry. The ultimate target in both cases may be people's sensitive information -- a troubling reality that should finally motivate organizations to get serious about security. Tuesday’s attack was more sophisticated than WannaCry, which took advantage of a Windows exploit to infect more than 200,000 computers in 150 countries (and which cost, by one estimate, more than $4 billion). Microsoft security researchers have traced the initial infection to a Ukrainian software vendor called M.E.Doc, which inadvertently released a malevolent update to its popular tax accounting software. When customers installed the automatic update, a piece of malware obtained passwords that were then used to gain access to other machines. The so-called Petya virus then locked users out of their computers and demanded $300 in bitcoin to get back in. The attack was hardly lucrative for its instigators. Although it affected thousands of corporate networks, the ransom address accumulated a grand total of only $9,159. Even the WannaCry ransom amounts to only $130,000 in bitcoin to date. The NSA has reportedly linked the WannaCry cyberattack to North Korea. I suppose $130,000 goes a lot further in North Korea than it does here, but that’s still barely enough for a stick of plutonium. We’ve talked before about the economics of cyber extortion. Given the overhead costs of packaging and distribution, it’s rarely a profitable venture. On the other hand, a locked-up computer system presents the perfect cover for attackers to steal sensitive data. The WannaCry attack targeted National Health Service hospitals in England and Scotland, perhaps because health care records contain irrevocable information that can be used for identity theft. Given that yesterday’s ransomware propagated though a tax accounting package favored by Ukrainian businesses, the most likely victims were financial account controllers doing business in the Ukraine. Notable victims include legal firm DLA Piper and shipping and transport firm A.P. Moller-Maersk. It’s worth noting that cloud computing services like Google and Amazon, which control vast amounts of data around the world, have yet to be crippled by a ransomware attack or even suffer a known data breach. Google in particular prevents break-ins across a global workforce by implementing a strict provisioning system, in which every device is presumed to be untrustworthy. Access management is an old-fashioned idea that doesn’t get enough attention in our hyper-connected world. In earlier generations, sensitive information was stored in locked filing cabinets located in separate offices. We’ve since digitized the data without replicating the access management. When organizations migrated from application-specific mainframes to networked personal computers (primarily to cut costs), they turned every single computer into a potential entry point for hackers. It's like giving every employee a master key to the building. Cloud computing has a lot of similarities to mainframe infrastructure. Users access enterprise software through their internet browsers, much as they used to access the mainframe through dumb terminals. Because individual users aren’t in charge of maintaining critical software on their personal machines, it’s much more difficult for malware to get in. This makes the whole enterprise less vulnerable to breaches. Stories of crippling ransomware dominate the news, but ensuing data breaches tend not to surface for years. Such breaches primarily affect end users in ways that may be difficult to trace, so organizations haven't been terribly motivated to overhaul their security and dump the universally connected computing paradigm. Perhaps the latest disasters will put more pressure on the industry to get its act together.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/wpp-suffers-suspected-cyber-attack-as-ukraine-russia-also-hit,"WPP Plc, the world’s largest advertising company, was hit by a cyber attack, as companies in the Ukraine and Russia were also being targeted. “IT systems in several WPP companies have been affected,” WPP said in an e-mailed statement Tuesday. “We are assessing the situation, taking appropriate measures and will update as soon as possible.” WPP’s website is down, and employees have been told to turn off their computers and not use Wi-fi, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sea Containers, the London offices of WPP creative agency Ogilvy & Mather, has been shut down, another person said. Images on Twitter showed screens that said users’ files had been encrypted and demanded $300 be paid in Bitcoin to unlock them. That matches the profile of the Petya virus which, according to the Moscow-based cybersecurity company Group-IB, disabled computers at more than 80 companies in Russia and Ukraine on Tuesday and demanded a $300 ransom in cryptocurrency. The strikes follow the global ransomware assault in May involving the WannaCry virus that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries as extortionists demanded $300 in bitcoin from victims for them to be decrypted. Ransomware attacks have been soaring and the number of such incidents increased by 50 percent in 2016, according to an April report from Verizon Communications Inc. — With assistance by Giles Turner"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-28/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day," Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here The euro jumps with bond yields, a ransomware hack goes global, and the oil rally stumbles. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. The euro rose to its highest level in more than a year against the U.S. dollar, trading at $1.1361 by 5:00 a.m. Eastern Time. The move follows European Central Bank President Mario Draghi's Tuesday speech, in which he downplayed deflation risks. Euro-area government bond yields are also rising this morning, with German bunds adding to yesterday's selloff. Comments from Federal Reserve President Janet Yellen and other Fed speakers about overvalued asset prices also helped take the wind out of the equity market's sails, with weakness at the U.S. close feeding into Asian and European trading. Don't expect a break from central bankers today as the ECB forum in Portugal hosts a policy panel featuring the heads of the euro-area's central bank as well as the Bank of England, Bank of Japan and Bank of Canada.  A ransomware cyberattack, which started in Ukraine yesterday and appears similar to last month's WannaCry hack, has spread across the globe. India's largest container port was unable to load or unload cargo after A.P. Moller-Maersk was impacted. The hackers are seeking $300 in bitcoin to release files from computers that are affected. The cryptocurrency was up $240 from yesterday's low at $2,514.70 by 5:20 a.m. The rally in oil failed to hold, with a barrel of West Texas Intermediate for August delivery trading at $44.08 as of 5:30 a.m. after U.S. industry data showed crude stockpiles rose. Traders are warning that the commodity could be due for a violent price rise as bearish bets against crude, which have risen to the highest level in six years, risk a short-covering rally. For consumers, the price fall this year means prices at the pump for gas are the lowest since 2005.  Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index fell 0.3 percent, with Japan's Topix index also dropping 0.3 percent as tech stocks were hit by the hack attack as well as Yellen's comments. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.4 percent lower at 5:45 a.m. with tech stocks once again amongst the biggest losers. S&P 500 futures were slightly higher.  U.S. bank dividends and buyback plans are set to be approved after markets close today in the second part of the Fed's stress test. Lenders are expected to return $121 billion to shareholders next year. Speaking of dividends and buybacks, Nestle SA made its first concession to activist investor Dan Loeb yesterday when it announced a $21 billion share purchase to boost its stock price.  This is what's caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/rosneft-oil-flow-uninterrupted-as-hackers-target-russia-ukraine,"Rosneft PJSC said oil output was uninterrupted after the servers of Russia’s largest crude producer were infected by a virus that targeted companies across the country and neighboring Ukraine. “The hacker attack could have led to serious consequences, but due to the fact that the company switched to a backup system for managing production processes, neither production nor preparation of oil was stopped,” Rosneft said Tuesday in a statement. The company also tweeted that it has asked law-enforcement agencies to investigate. Businesses in Russia and Ukraine have come under attack from the Petya virus, which has locked computers at energy and transport companies, banks and state bodies, demanding $300 in cryptocurrency to unblock them, according to Moscow-based cyber-security firm Group-IB. London-based advertising giant WPP Plc also said it had been affected, as did shipping operator A.P. Moller-Maersk in Copenhagen. Hacking efforts against oil and gas companies globally have become more frequent and sophisticated as the industry relies increasingly on technology. Rosneft itself has said it plans to make greater use of digital technologies, and this month agreed with General Electric Co. to collaborate in this area. Telecommunications operators and retailers have also been struck by the Petya virus, which is spreading in a similar way to the WannaCry attack last month, Group-IB said.  The May assault affected more than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries, according to Europol, the European Union’s law-enforcement agency. The hackers used malware to encrypt computer files, making them inaccessible, and demanded a ransom. Russia and Ukraine had a heavy concentration of infections, according to Dutch security company Avast Software BV."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-27/ukraine-russia-report-ransomware-computer-virus-attacks,"A new cyberattack similar to WannaCry is spreading from Europe to the U.S. and South America, hitting port operators in New York, Rotterdam and Argentina, disrupting government systems in Kiev, and disabling operations at companies including Rosneft PJSC, advertiser WPP Plc. and the Chernobyl nuclear facility. More than 80 companies in Russia and Ukraine were initially affected by the Petya virus that disabled computers Tuesday and told users to pay $300 in cryptocurrency to unlock them, Moscow-based cybersecurity company Group-IB said. About 2,000 users have been attacked so far, according to Kaspersky Lab analysts, with organizations in Russia and the Ukraine the most affected. Rob Wainwright, executive director at Europol, said the agency is ""urgently responding"" to reports of the new cyber attack. In a separate statement, Europol said it’s in talks with ""member states and key industry partners to establish the full nature of this attack at this time."" Kremlin-controlled Rosneft, Russia’s largest crude producer, said in a statement that it avoided “serious consequences” from the “hacker attack” by switching to “a backup system for managing production processes.” U.K. media company WPP’s website is down, and employees have been told to turn off their computers and not use WiFi, according to a person familiar with the matter. Sea Containers, the London building that houses WPP and agencies including Ogilvy & Mather, has been shut down, another person said. “IT systems in several WPP companies have been affected,” the company said in emailed statement. “With there being no global kill switch for this one, we’ll continue to see the numbers rise in different parts of the world as more vulnerable systems become more exposed,” said Beau Woods, deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council in Washington. Most vulnerable are places “where the operators are a lot of the times at the mercy of manufacturers and providers of those technologies and there’s a long time between existence of a fix and implementation of a fix.” The hack quickly spread from Russia and the Ukraine, through Europe and into the U.S. A.P. Moller-Maersk, operator of the world’s largest container line, said its customers can’t use online booking tools and its internal systems are down. The attack is affecting multiple sites and units, which include a major port operator and an oil and gas producer, spokeswoman Concepcion Boo Arias said by phone. APM Terminals, owned by Maersk, is experiencing system issues at multiple terminals, including the Port of New York and New Jersey, the largest port on the U.S. East Coast, and Rotterdam in The Netherlands, Europe’s largest harbor. APM Terminals at the Port of New York and New Jersey will be closed for the rest of the day “due to the extent of the system impact,” the Port said. Cie de Saint-Gobain, a French manufacturer, said its systems had also been infected, though a spokeswoman declined to elaborate, and the French national railway system, the SNCF, was also affected, according to Le Parisien. Mondelez International Inc. said it was also experiencing a global IT outage and was looking into the cause. Merck & Co. Inc., based in Kenilworth, New Jersey, reported that its computer network was compromised due to the hack. Port operators at grain terminals in Rosario, Argentina also reported the attack affected operations, including halting some deliveries, beginning Tuesday morning, according to Guillermo Wade, manager of the Rosario port and maritime chamber. The strikes follow the global ransomware assault involving the WannaCry virus that affected hundreds of thousands of computers in more than 150 countries as extortionists demanded $300 in bitcoin from victims. Ransomware attacks have been soaring and the number of such incidents increased by 50 percent in 2016, according to Verizon Communications Inc.  Analysts at Symantec Corp., have said the new virus, called Petya, uses an exploit called EternalBlue to spread, much like WannaCry. EternalBlue works on vulnerabilities in Microsoft Corp.’s Windows operating system. The new virus has a fake Microsoft digital signature appended to it and the attack is spreading to many countries, Costin Raiu, director of the global research and analysis team at Moscow-based Kaspersky Lab, said on Twitter. The attack has hit Ukraine particularly hard. The intrusion is “the biggest in Ukraine’s history,” Anton Gerashchenko, an aide to the Interior Ministry, wrote on Facebook. The goal was “the destabilization of the economic situation and in the civic consciousness of Ukraine,” though it was “disguised as an extortion attempt,” he said. For more on cybersecurity, check out the Decrypted podcast:   Kyivenergo, a Ukrainian utility, switched off all computers after the hack, while another power company, Ukrenergo, was also affected, though “not seriously,” the Interfax news service reported. Ukrainian delivery network Nova Poshta halted service to clients after its network was infected, the company said on Facebook. Ukraine’s Central Bank warned on its website that several banks had been targeted by hackers. — With assistance by Joe Mayes, Christian Wienberg, Nour Al Ali, Polina Noskova, Jordan Robertson, and Nafeesa Syeed"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-22/bitcoin-startup-blockchain-takes-40-million-in-fresh-funding,"Blockchain, the London-based bitcoin currency service provider, has raised $40 million of fresh funding, representing one of the largest investment rounds in the financial technology sector since Britain’s vote to leave the European Union. New investors in the company, which provides technology such as virtual bitcoin wallets and analytical tools for the digital currency’s underlying system, include Google’s GV, which led the funding with Lakestar. Existing investors, including Lightspeed Venture Partners and Sir Richard Branson, provided new financing. “The pace of innovation in the digital currency space is unmatched,” said Tom Hulme, a partner at GV. “We were impressed by Blockchain’s consistent market traction and dedication to building secure financial products for an increasing number of users.” Bitcoin, and the blockchain system that powers it, is one of several virtual currencies and the value of one bitcoin skyrocketed more than 300 percent in the last year. A competing currency, Ether, based on the ethereum blockchain, reached a record $402 earlier this month. Blockchain Chief Executive Officer and co-Founder Peter Smith said his company’s new funding was raised before bitcoin and ether’s recent run up. ""We did it a few months ago,"" he told Caroline Hyde in an interview on Bloomberg Television Thursday. While it has been accepted for legitimate transactions by companies such as Microsoft Corp., Expedia Inc. and social media platform Reddit, it is also a favorite tool for criminals seeking ways of anonymously sending and receiving money, such as during the May WannaCry ransomware attack that affected countless businesses and hospitals worldwide. In a press release, Blockchain said its new investment will support a wider global expansion and related localization efforts, as well as further research and development for its product. “The 14 trillion dollar financial services industry hasn’t meaningfully changed in over a century,” said Smith in the release. “Blockchain is on a mission to create a financial system that is faster, more inclusive, and radically different than the status quo.” Blockchain had previously raised $30.5 million in 2014."

Google and Apple craft driverless car alliances, EU demands more from U.K.'s May, and digital currencies tumble. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. Deals between two of the world's tech giants and auto rental companies were revealed on Monday, moves which could eventually shape the future of transportation. One will see Avis Budget Group Inc. manage Alphabet's fleet of autonomous vehicles, while another sees Apple Inc. lease vehicles from Hertz Global Holdings Inc. to test its self-driving technology. Shares of those car rental companies were up more than double-digits on the news, though they remain deep in negative territory year-to-date. In a broader comment on the outlook for U.S. auto demand, General Motors Co. said that light vehicle sales this year would likely total in the low 17 million range, down modestly from 2016. U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May's promises on the rights of European Union nationals in the U.K. post-Brexit aren't good enough, according to officials in Brussels. Chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier tweeted that ""more ambition, clarity, and guarantees"" were needed following May's address to Parliament in order to resolve an issue that's delaying trade discussions between the two parties. On Monday, May formally sealed a deal with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party to support her minority government in key votes. Digital currencies got crushed Monday, with bitcoin falling as much as 15 percent at its lows of the day. Online forums suggested that Coinbase's exchange was down at one point in the day. This widespread selloff in crypto-currencies comes on the heels of last week's massive flash crash in ether. The S&P 500 Index went nowhere Monday as weakness in tech shares was offset by strength in financial and consumer stocks. Disappointing U.S. data buoyed Treasuries, while front-month West Texas Intermediate futures gained almost 1 percent. Meanwhile, a ""fat finger"" trade in gold prompted a drop of as much as 1.6 percent for the precious metal. S&P/ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 equity futures are in positive territory as of 5:30 a.m. Tokyo time. There are only a few noteworthy pieces of Asia-Pacific economic data on the docket Tuesday. Chinese industrial profits for May, which rose 14 percent year-on-year in their latest reading, are due out, as well as New Zealand's May trade balance, projected to slim to a surplus of 419 million kiwi. Chinese Premier Li Keqiang is slated to speak at the so-called Summer Davos Forum in Dalian at 11:30 a.m. Tokyo time. In Portugal, day two of the European Central Bank's forum will bring speeches from executive board members Benoit Coeure and Peter Praet. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."
2017-06-27T13:30:03.270Z,Index Makers and Ether Profits,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-27/index-makers-and-ether-profits,"Indexing. Honestly it's a little weird that there's no Fortune 500 index. Now there will be: Yes, it's a good brand, but also you know that there will be people who are like ""I know I am supposed to index by buying that 500-stock thing, what's it called,"" and they'll think of the Fortune 500, and now they'll have a place to put their money. This index only has 450 stocks (there are private companies in the Fortune 500), but close enough. Also: equal weighted! It's a good brand and it's smart beta! Honestly it would not be especially weird if there were no Quincy Jones index. He is a musical legend, sure, but not as far as I know famous for his stock-picking. But here is the prospectus for the Quincy Jones Streaming Music, Media & Entertainment ETF, an exchange-traded fund based on the Quincy Jones Streaming Music, Media & Entertainment Index, which ... exists. An image of Quincy Jones will be added to the prospectus in a future amendment, which raises important questions like (1) why, and (2) why couldn't it be included in the original filing? Best of all may be this description of how the firm that constructed the QJSMM&E Index goes about its business: IconicBeta: It's like smart beta, only instead of being smart, it's marketable. I should launch an index. It's ... just ... [gestures listlessly] ... some companies. Quick, give me your money. We really live in an amazing era of investing. The old way of investing was that star mutual-fund managers would do a lot of research to pick stocks that they thought would go up, and you would give them your money because you trusted their skill. That trust has eroded, and now the new way of investing is that star music producers lend their names to lists of stocks, and you give them your money because you are like ""oh, Quincy Jones, that's cool."" Passive investing is the triumph of rationality and science over superstition and charisma, and yet somehow it has given us the Quincy Jones ETF. Elsewhere, here is my Bloomberg View colleague Mark Gilbert on Norway's sovereign wealth fund's efforts to get index providers to kick out companies with nonvoting shares. He writes: I don't know, doesn't this seem like a market opportunity? Like why shouldn't I launch the Money Stuff 500 index, which is a lot like the S&P 500 except that it excludes companies with nonvoting stock? If you think that nonvoting stock is bad for shareholders, then you should buy an MS 500 index fund instead of an S&P 500 index fund: Sure you ""risk under-performing"" versus the S&P, but you also risk outperforming, and if nonvoting stock is actually bad then the MS 500 should outperform. But also, the MS 500 would be an ""index,"" so you could just use it as a benchmark. If you are a giant institutional investor that likes to talk a lot about voting rights, you can compare your performance to the MS 500 index rather than the S&P 500, because it is a better reflection of the market that you are interested in. Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. will be off doing their nonvoting thing, sure, but they won't be relevant to the huge class of investors who benchmark to the MS 500 index, all of whom will pay me a modest licensing fee. Why not just do this? Why lobby the index firms? Once we have all agreed that indexes are not objective reflections of the market, but are instead subjective human constructs designed to achieve governance goals, what gives the incumbent index providers their authority? Why not cut out the middleman, set up your own index with the criteria you like, and then measure yourself against it? Surely it makes at least as much sense as the Quincy Jones index.  Meanwhile: ""In Response to CalPERS Lawsuit, IAC Abandons Plan to Issue Non-Voting Stock."" No index lobbying required! (But: a lawsuit.) And here is an ETF that ""buys stocks deemed overly short in anticipation of a squeeze higher,"" and makes money on the stock-borrow income while it waits. It is down 0.6 percent since March, since I guess the stocks that everyone hates are hated for a reason. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Bitcoin and ether and ripple and most of the other big cryptocurrencies plunged yesterday, and the Wall Street Journal attributed the drop to ""profit taking,"" which is surely a sign that the cryptocurrency market has matured. Also, this is good patter; if you saw someone say this on TV you'd almost think he was talking about the stock market: What you want, when you are creating a whole new economic paradigm from scratch, is to one day reach the point where people talk about it with reporters by saying things like ""fear and greed cycle"" and ""sheep pile on."" That's how you know you've made it. Meanwhile, the GDAX exchange is giving some customers their money back if they lost it during last week's ether flash crash. That is nice of them! I must say that, for all the talk from blockchain enthusiasts about immutable code and irreversible transactions, they sure spend a lot of time reversing transactions. And here is Zack Korman with some blockchain skepticism: I actually do sometimes think that about Twitter, honestly, but point taken. And here is David Adlerstein on smart contracts, asking: ""Are smart contracts contracts? Are smart contracts smart? And are smart contracts legally recognizable?"" One point he makes is that the ""smart"" portion of a smart contract may not be the whole ""contract"": ""While some relatively simple agreements could have essentially all of their performance automated (including by blockchain), for more sophisticated agreements only discrete elements are likely to be automated in the foreseeable future; thus, 'smart contractual provisions' might be a more appropriate term.""  How's Martin Shkreli doing? Really great actually: ""By the end of Monday, more than 130 prospective jurors had been dismissed for one reason or another,"" and they'll try again today. Here is another article that is also just people saying mean things about Shkreli. (""The defendant is the face of corporate greed in America,"" says a guy. Really?) It is a shame that only people called for jury duty get to participate; really they should open up the public Shkreli-bashing session to everyone. There'd be a line around the block. But maybe it's a brilliant strategy! If you make everyone hate you, then the government won't be able to find an impartial jury to hear your criminal trial, so I guess they'll just have to let you go? That is especially not legal advice, but I don't know, there are movies about people getting away with murder because of weird technicalities of the law, like double jeopardy or spousal privilege. Someone should make a movie about a guy who makes everyone in America hate him, and then gets away with murder because there's no impartial jury to hear his case. ""I think he's a very evil man,"" a potential juror will say, and he'll high-five his lawyer. Elsewhere, maybe don't name your trading firm ""Wall Street Pirate Management, LLC."" They tend to notice that sort of thing. Director pay. Here are a blog post and related paper from Mustafa Dah and Melissa Frye asking a fun question: Is it good to pay your board of directors a lot of money, or is it not good? The argument that it's good is that you will attract better directors who will work hard for their money. (""Directors may feel beholden to shareholders to work hard and retain their high pay,"" hypothesize Dah and Frye.) The argument that it is bad is that the directors will be like, hmm, it is pleasant to be here on this well-paid board, I'd better not do anything to annoy the chief executive officer and risk my seat. (""Directors may be hesitant to destabilize the status quo and jeopardize their positions and compensation."") The bad argument sure sounds more convincing, but perhaps I am just a cynic? No, it turns out that it's bad: Fannie and Freddie. Senator Bob Corker said in a statement that ""there continues to be strong, bipartisan consensus in Congress that we must act to reform our nation’s housing finance system and protect taxpayers from future economic downturns,"" which is sort of a funny way to put it? There has been a continuing consensus for like nine years that Congress has to act to reform the housing finance system, and yet Congress hasn't acted. Maybe if the consensus continues for another decade they'll do something. Anyway the latest news on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac is that Corker and Senator Mark Warner ""are seriously considering a plan that would break up the mortgage-finance giants"" and that ""would attempt to foster competition in the secondary mortgage market."" Robot HR. Here is a story about how Unilever Plc outsources its hiring decisions to robots: ""It was definitely a weird feeling to know that robots are judging you,"" says an intern, but over time I bet that will change. Eventually it will just be normal to adapt your speech and behavior and clothes and facial expressions to please the robots. Teens will dress to impress robots, and by the time they enter the workforce it will seem totally natural to be judged constantly by robots. A generation optimized to please college admissions officers will be replaced by a generation optimized to please robots. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. ""Markets Have Nothing Left to Fear But Fearlessness Itself,"" it says here, quoting a guy who says ""I’m uncomfortable that people are so comfortable with this,"" and one thing that I am not worried about is that we will run out of synonyms for ""people are worried that people aren't worried enough."" Meanwhile here is I guess a quantitative measure of how worried people are about how worried they aren't? What? That measure seems to be the ratio of the VVIX (forward volatility of the VIX index) to the VIX (forward volatility of the S&P 500 index). The worry index is near an all-time low, but the worrying-about-the-worry-index-index is at an all-time high, at least relative to the worry index. I will not be satisfied until the VIX and VVIX are both at all-time lows, but the VVVIX is spiking. ""People aren't worried,"" I'll explain, ""and they're not worried that they're not worried, but they are worried that they're not worried that they're not worried."" People are worried about non-GAAP accounting. They're not, but yesterday I tweeted a dumb joke about how the sequel to the Ben Affleck movie ""The Accountant"" should be subtitled ""The Restatement,"" and it got a lot of dumb funny accounting-joke responses, if you're into that sort of thing. ""Subsequent Developments"" is my favorite, though ""2 Entry 2 Bookkeeping"" is also good, and ""Pro Forma"" will probably be accurate. I am sorry about this.

2017-06-26T18:48:54.816Z,"Why Cold, Hard Cash Remains King","Leonid Bershidsky
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-26/why-cold-hard-cash-remains-king,"We don't have to like the way technology is changing the world. Given the technological disruption that's happening everywhere, it's reasonable to expect a little Luddite pushback. The growing share of cash in advanced economies might fall in that category. Economists rarely admit they don't understand something related to their area of expertise. But Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a Brussels think tank, did so in a fresh paper for the European Parliament. He called the increasing cash-to-economic output ratios a ""mystery."" Isn't cash supposed to be going obsolete with all the modern payment methods, from debit and credit cards to the latest fintech apps? Well, it's not, except in Sweden and Denmark, where conscious efforts are being made to create cashless societies. Here is Gros's chart showing the increasing share of cash: There are a couple potential explanations here. Since the use of cash in payments isn't growing -- cashless transactions increased globally to $617 billion last year from $60 billion in 2010 -- it might be logical to assume banknotes are used as a savings medium in the era of near-zero interest rates. But, according to Gros, no correlation between rates and the cash-to-gross domestic product ratio has been found. Gros pointed out that in the euro area, 500-euro bills make up a decreasing share of the cash in circulation and the share of 50-euro bills is rapidly increasing; that's too small a denomination to keep large savings in. And in any case, keeping big amounts of money in cash is unsafe, inconvenient and subject to crippling regulation when one wants to spend it, not to mention abrupt moves such as India's clumsy demonetization last year. More cash could also be associated with a growing shadow economy. But the informal sector is shrinking everywhere, and the share of cash relative to GDP has increased the most in Japan, where the shadow economy is small, only about 10 percent of GDP. One could also argue that a lot of dollars and euros are used outside their domestic circulation areas. But that wouldn't explain cash growth in Hungary or the Czech Republic -- no one uses the forint or the koruna outside their home countries. I have argued that if governments want to eliminate cash -- and, theoretically, they'd all like to, if only to shrink the black market and complicate terrorist funding -- they should also promote the spread of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. These are anonymous enough but still somewhat easier to trace than cash, striking a good balance between letting people trade privately, without supervision, and making criminal activity riskier and more difficult. That, however, was the argument of a habitual early adopter of every kind of new technology. Most people aren't like that, and I know I'm also changing as I grow older. I miss the more durable, heavier, lower-tech objects of 20 or 30 years ago. The best car I've ever owned was a Land Rover Defender, which had barely any electronics in it. Three years ago, my family gave away all the books that filled our apartment and switched to e-books -- but now my younger daughter shows a clear preference for dead-tree books, and I find a guilty pleasure in handling them when I read to her. Clearly, Amazon is on to something with its expanding chain of brick-and-mortar bookstores. They are different from traditional ones in that they stock and display books according to their performance in the company's online store, but Amazon appears to cherish the physical interaction with customers, who, in turn, miss the tactile aspect of real-world browsing. It's easier to use a service like Apple Pay or a plastic card than traditional money. But there's an old, pre-digital magic to cash. There's something of a ritual to counting out bills or to folding them to put in a wallet. There's also a physical reaction: A 2012 study found that people salivate at the sight of cash because we're conditioned to feel its attraction. Using cash also increases one's emotional investment in a purchase. I remember hesitating in a Kathmandu shop that sold traditional tangka paintings: The price seemed too high. So the seller urged me to pay with a credit card. ""Easy money, plastic money,"" he said. The tangka over my desk at home reminds me of the episode every time I look at it. In Germany, where I live, a majority of transactions are still conducted in cash. ""One shouldn't forget that trust in a currency begins with cash,"" Carl-Ludwig Thiele, a member of the board at at Germany's central bank, said in a speech earlier this year. He meant the pre-digital, material quality of cash money. The euro banknotes are a highly visible symbol of the united Europe project, one that gives rise to strong emotions. I have no proof that people are hoarding more cash because of an attachment to the retreating physical world, to the kind of ancient convenience that doesn't require a charged battery or internet access. But other reasonable explanations have been rejected. It's intriguing to think that human nature might be rebelling against the technological revolution in this quiet but fundamental way. Perhaps, as technology becomes more invasive and aggressive, it will mount more such counterattacks.

2017-06-21T13:09:01.291Z,Uber Changes and Index Additions,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-21/uber-changes-and-index-additions,"Programming note: Money Stuff will be off tomorrow, but back on Friday. Uber! I guess the lesson of Travis Kalanick's resignation as chief executive officer of Uber Technologies Inc. is that you can be the visionary founder of a massive company, stay private to avoid the pressures of the public market, keep control of a majority of the voting power of the shares, and still be forced out in a boardroom coup led by activist shareholders: It is not easy to be pushed out of running the private company that you founded and still control: In Kalanick's case, it required months of terrible publicity, an investigation into workplace culture led by outside lawyers, his own confession that he ""must fundamentally change as a leader and grow up,"" and a self-requested leave of absence to deal with tragedy in his personal life that left Uber without a day-to-day CEO. Also Uber has never come within a thousand miles of being profitable, which probably matters a bit? I suspect that if it was making billions of dollars a year, rather than losing billions of dollars a year, then the investors might have been a bit more tolerant of bad publicity and sexual harassment and discrimination and privacy violations and theft of trade secrets and obstructing government authorities and I am sure I am forgetting some things. What if Kalanick had said no? ""Uber’s board said in a statement that Mr. Kalanick had 'always put Uber first'""; Kalanick said he resigned because ""I love Uber more than anything in the world"" and wanted to spare it from a fight. What if he had been like ""nah, fight me for it""? In some strict sense there is not much that the investors could have done: He has the votes, and they don't, and he could have just toughed it out and sat through some awkward board meetings for the next few years. But in another sense, Uber keeps raising billions of dollars from investors to pay for its losses as it grows, so it can't easily afford to alienate all the big investors it already has. The time when shareholders have clout is when you need their money. Again, if Uber was making billions of dollars a year, even if the investors weren't more tolerant of all the bad stuff, Kalanick would have been in a much better position to ignore them. Anyway, there will be ""a board-led search committee for a new chief executive,"" and that will be a fun job to parachute into! Take over from a visionary founder whose play for world domination is only half finished (and who is still a majority owner by votes), fix a broken workplace culture, win an existential race (and legal battle) to develop autonomous vehicles, and find a way to turn a profit in a business that has lost billions of dollars a year. I guess Marissa Mayer is available now?  Meanwhile, you'll be able to tip Uber drivers. Why? Everyone knows that tipping is terrible, and on Uber it is terrible both for the usual socioeconomic-horror reasons and also because, you know, you have to pull out your phone again after you get out of the Uber. Everyone also worries that Uber's drivers are underpaid and ill-treated, sure. But there is actually a very simple solution to this problem: Raise fares by 20 percent, and give the money to the drivers. (You can call it a ""service charge"" if you insist.) That way (1) the drivers would have the money, (2) the passengers would feel better about themselves without the hassle of tipping, and (3) Uber might actually get some good press for once? I mean I get that an across-the-board 20 percent price increase would probably annoy some people. But adding tipping is an across-the-board 20 percent price increase, only in a much more annoying way. Indexes. Congratulations to China's $6.9 trillion stock market, which is now officially a stock market I guess: ""MSCI estimates some $17 billion will flow into Chinese markets—both from passive funds that automatically track its indexes and active fund managers—when the country’s stocks are included a year from now,"" giving indexers something like a quarter of a percentage point of China's stock market, which is the second-biggest in the world behind America's. In some ways it's the weirdest possible result. If the emerging-markets index excludes China, then that is just definitional: China is not an emerging market, but neither is the U.S., and your investing strategy can involve allocating to China and the U.S. and emerging markets, and measuring your performance separately against the Shanghai Composite and the S&P 500 and the emerging-market index, or whatever. If the emerging-markets index is dominated by China, then you can compare your performance to that of the emerging markets as a whole, including China, while understanding that you will probably not be able to match the index's China exposure because of access difficulties. ""The emerging-markets index was up 15 percent, but I was up only 12 percent because it's hard to invest in China"": a perfectly sensible description of reality. Just because an index can describe ""the market"" doesn't mean that you can invest in it seamlessly. But if the emerging-markets index is  0.7 percent China, then ... what ... is it ... an index ... of? It's an index of, like, ""emerging markets weighted by how much big money managers want to invest in them."" That weighting feels a bit like cheating, an index based on investor choice and convenience rather than market definition. Meanwhile, MSCI will sort of function like an activist investor, pushing China to liberalize its stock market if it wants a higher weighting in the MSCI indexes. John Authers notes that MSCI's ""leverage remains almost total"" to drive change in China: Elsewhere, will Elizabeth Warren ban index funds? That's from Franklin Foer's story about the decline of the Democrats and the rise of populism; on Twitter, Matt Yglesias called the bit about institutional investors ""the sleeper issue of our time."" We talk about it a lot around here, and yet it does still feel pretty sleepy. When the government bans index funds, you can probably say you heard about it here first, but I would not hold my breath for that. Banning index funds is like getting rid of the mortgage interest deduction, in that it's one of those progressive-populist ideas that would probably be incredibly unpopular. Robots. Here is sort of a strange story about a money manager who thinks that robots will eventually dominate trading of straightforward liquid assets -- ""Algorithms are already reading, processing, and trading the news even before the photons have hit your retina,"" he says -- and that the right approach for human money managers is to put their clients' money into weird illiquid stuff where the computers can't compete: What is the argument here? Is it: Or is it instead:  If the dark-matter stuff will have better performance than the public stuff, then you should invest your clients' money in it regardless of what the computers are up to. But if it will have worse performance than the public stuff, then you should tell your clients to hire a computer to invest their money in public markets, and then close up shop. You can't start your thinking about what human money managers should do from the premise that they should keep their jobs. Maybe what human money managers should do is flee into assets where computers can't follow them, but maybe what they should do is quit. It depends on whether the weird assets are a good idea. Elsewhere: ""Rise of Robots: Inside the World's Fastest Growing Hedge Funds."" CDS are good. Credit default swaps are, among other things, a way for banks to hedge their exposure to the credit risk of their borrowers. That is good: We want banks to be safe, and hedging is a good way to reduce risk. But it is also bad: We want banks to be banks, to make carefully considered credit decisions, and if they can quickly pass on their credit risk to public-market investors who are not in a position to monitor the borrowers, then they may make worse lending decisions and increase the overall risk in the system. (In Nicholas Dunbar's telling, that is the central story of the financial crisis.) Here is a Deutsche Bundesbank discussion paper that looks at the ""Small Bang,"" a 2009 revision of contract terms for European CDS that improved liquidity in that market, to try to figure out which effect is more important: Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Here is a story about how it is profitable to sell picks and shovels during a gold rush: It is too late for me to get into graphics-card manufacturing, but wouldn't it be fun to move out to the frontier near the ether mines and open up a saloon? I picture the ether miners as a hard-livin', hard-drinkin', hard-cussin' crowd, and I bet they could use a saloon. Ugh wait never mind someone has already had that idea.  People are worried about stock buybacks. Cardiff Garcia argues that ""short-termism is as much consequence as cause of weak growth"": People are worried about unicorns. Theranos Inc., the Blood Unicorn, is still doing stuff:  The settlement is for ""less than $30 million,"" considerably less than the $140 million that Walgreens had put into the partnership, but about half of the $54 million in cash that Theranos now has left. It ""has been spending about $10 million a month since, much of it on legal costs."" And it ""still faces a civil investigation by the Securities and Exchange Commission and a criminal investigation by the Justice Department."" Do you think ... I hardly dare to type it ... do you think that we'll soon see Theranos raising money? What if it does a new funding round? ""We are raising money from investors to pay lawyers to fight charges that we defrauded the investors we previously raised money from,"" the offering memo could say.

2017-06-19T05:00:00.001Z,Bitcoin Is Digital Gold. But Will You Buy a Sandwich With It?,"Justina Lee
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-19/bitcoin-is-digital-gold-but-will-you-buy-a-sandwich-with-it,"For digital-marketing agency Cooperatize.com, taking bitcoin for payment was easy enough, all co-founder Roger Wu had to do was obtain a digital wallet. To promote the move in 2014, he even penned a blog post for Forbes explaining the decision. The number of transactions the New York-based firm has made since? Zero. “The biggest thing is are people willing to pay in bitcoin?” Wu said. “The reality is that most of our customers are other businesses and other businesses don’t use bitcoin."" Even as the euphoria over bitcoin reached a fever pitch last week as the price surged to almost $3,000, slow transaction times and inertia are helping to prevent it from achieving widespread usage. Adoption has slowed, according to Morgan Stanley, after a slew of companies from Microsoft Corp. to Expedia Inc. initially trumpeted its use, and hurdles remain when it comes to longer-term viability. “We see few reasons for consumers to use bitcoin over a credit/debit card given that paying online with bitcoin represents a marginally more inconvenient way to pay,” Morgan Stanley analysts wrote in a 33-page report released June 13. Processing costs for bitcoin and other digital currencies are likely to grow, they said. Read more on the companies benefiting from the demand for cryptocurrencies Time Inc. and Dell Inc. said they’ve stopped accepting the cryptocurrency, with the computer maker citing low usage. When website content management system Wordpress stopped taking bitcoin in 2015, founder Matt Mullenweg said usage was “vanishingly small,” adding that it was initially incorporated for philosophical reasons, not commercial ones. “It’s quite possible that after a while you just realize it’s not worth the cost of tooling up to take it and you decide to drop it if the publicity has run its course,” said David Yermack, a professor at New York University Stern School of Business who studies bitcoin. Still, there’s plenty of evidence the price surge has helped boost bitcoin’s use -- albeit from a low base.  Payment processor BitPay said its now handling about $2 million in transactions a day, up almost threefold from April 2016. Coinbase’s volume has doubled since the start of the year. Overstock.com Inc., an online discounter, said it’s been handling around 100,000 bitcoin transactions per week, up from about 30,000 when it first added the payment method in 2014. “There is what might be called a wealth effect that occurs, so as price increases people actually counter-intuitively are more likely to spend bitcoin,” said Justin O’Brien, product manager at Coinbase in San Francisco, which has partnered with more than 46,000 businesses for bitcoin payment. Yet somewhat paradoxically, there’s the question of whether its status as a red-hot asset is compatible with being a stable method of payment. There’s the issue of volatility. This year has seen bitcoin surge and plunge by as much as 19 percent over the course of a day. As transactions rise, processing them is also becoming slower and more expensive because of a cap on the data the bitcoin blockchain can process -- an issue whose resolution has spurred bitter infighting within the development community. “The blockchain underpinnings of most cryptocurrencies scale too poorly for most currency-like uses,” the Morgan Stanley analysts wrote. “Time to clear single transactions can often be from 10 minutes to more than an hour.” And probably most importantly, bitcoin isn’t recognized as legal tender. The U.S. Internal Revenue Service has ruled that bitcoins are property, while regulators treat it as a commodity. Most big businesses take bitcoin through payment processors such as BitPay and Coinbase. When a consumer makes a purchase via those platforms, he or she will pay at a conversion rate based on the latest bitcoin price. The processors then convert the bitcoin immediately and pass the fiat currency to the seller, essentially removing all exposure to bitcoin’s volatility. Read more on how bitcoin is perplexing analysts For merchants, Coinbase charges nothing for the first $1 million and 1 percent of transaction values afterward. That compares with Visa Inc.’s roughly 2 percent interchange rate and almost 3 percent charged by PayPal Holdings Inc.  The process is more complicated for shoppers. Unless your digital wallet is already on the platform that’s processing the payment, transferring bitcoins incurs a transaction fee, which can vary depending on its size, how quickly you want it processed and network conditions. The median transaction fee was $2.10 on June 15, compared with an all-time high of nearly $3 reached earlier this month, according to BitInfoCharts. Sonny Singh, BitPay’s chief commercial officer, said bitcoin is more useful in emerging economies where trust in local currencies is weaker and credit cards are less common. The cryptocurrency is making more headway in markets like Japan, which started recognizing digital currencies as a form of payment this year, and in Venezuela, where the bolivar is almost worthless. It’s also useful for businesses that can’t rely on traditional banking, such as cannabis sellers. While greater usage remains in question, there are often some unexpected benefits for merchants who’ve embraced bitcoin. Since the Roast of Sherwood added a Coinbase wallet six weeks ago, it has averaged five bitcoin or ether transactions each week, according to Lee Galloway, who runs the sandwich stall with his father in a bustling street market along London’s Whitecross Street. “For a few small payments we’ve taken, it’s a large amount of publicity,” the 32-year-old said. “If we’re taking large amounts of cryptocurrency payments, I’ll probably have to re-address and re-look at the entire issue, but I can’t imagine that happening any time soon.” — With assistance by Yuji Nakamura"
2017-06-21T19:49:49.682Z,Ethereum Slides as Network Backlog Points to Growing Pains,"Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-21/ethereum-slides-as-network-backlog-points-to-growing-pains,"Ether, the virtual currency based on the ethereum blockchain, might be getting too popular for its own good.  The cryptocurrency slumped after congestion on its network slowed transactions, adding to concerns the novel combination of decentralized computing and cryptography hasn’t reached the level of maturity needed to go mainstream even as a growing cohort of investors clamor for access to the digital tokens. It fell 9.5 percent to $328, according to prices compiled by Coindesk.com. Ether reached a record $402 earlier this month. A series of initial coin offerings based on the ethereum network caused orders of ether to spike and triggered a bottleneck in the network, said crypto-trading platform CoinDash Chief Executive Officer Alon Muroch in an interview from Israel. “A huge amount of people wanted to send money into the smart contract of the ICO at the same time and it’s taking longer to process all those transactions,” Muroch said in a telephone interview. “More and more people are using this new technology to the point that we’re stretching its limit.” Mobile messaging platform Status, distributed computing power network SONM and Gilgam, a platform for decentralized eSports tournament management, are some of the projects built on the ethereum network that were raising funds through digital-coin sales in the past week. The backlog caused cryptocurrency exchanges Bitfinex and ShapeShift to halt ethereum transactions, according to the platforms’ tweets. Read more on how digital coins let tech startups ditch venture capitalists Ethereum has soared from about $8 at the start of the year to the over $400 in large part thanks to a boom in ICOs based on the network, as it allows for more complex actions than the more widely known bitcoin. The gains have helped ethereum’s market capitalization balloon to about $31.3 billion, compared with bitcoin’s $44.7 billion, prompting speculation it could soon overtake bitcoin as the largest cryptocurrency. Today’s network delays are evidence the sector will need to develop further to accept the volume and demand required to scale. Muroch said ethereum developers are on it. “This isn’t a surprise for people involved and there’s a roadmap on how to bring it forward and keep growing,” he said."
2017-06-23T01:42:42.966Z,"Machines Won’t Push Humans Out of Finance, Billionaire Gundlach Says","Amanda L Gordon
         & John Gittelsohn
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-23/gundlach-says-machines-won-t-oust-humans-from-finance-industry,"In the financial industry’s battle of humans versus machines, billionaire bond fund manager Jeffrey Gundlach is betting people will prevail. “I don’t believe in machines taking over finance at all,” Gundlach, chief executive officer of DoubleLine Capital, said Thursday night in a cocktail-hour interview before his induction into the Fixed Income Analysts Society Inc.’s Hall of Fame. Gundlach, 57, is a top-ranked money manager whose $54 billion DoubleLine Total Return Bond Fund has outperformed 90 percent of its Bloomberg peers over the past five years. He co-founded the Los Angeles-based firm, which managed more than $100 billion as of March 31, after being ousted by TCW Group in 2009. Gundlach singled out so-called robo-advisers, which provide online portfolio management using little human intervention, as a dangerous bet. “It’s a one-size-fits-all financial solution,” he said. “Everybody gets the same portfolio, which means everybody owns the same stock, which means when they all decide to get out you cause a crash.” What’s Gundlach’s advice for beating machines? “Work hard,” he said. Jim Grant, founder of Grant’s Interest Rate Observer, compared Gundlach to the beer-commercial character dubbed the “most interesting man in the world,” based in part on his stints as an Ivy League scholar and spiky-haired, bleached-blond rock drummer before becoming a star money manager. “Jeffrey would not be the most interesting man if all he did was buy low and sell high,” Grant said in prepared introductory remarks. Gundlach received the award for his multidecade performance as a portfolio manager and business builder, according to Mark Howard, head of U.S. credit strategy at BNP Paribas and a FIASI board member. “His teams at TCW and at DoubleLine have been remarkably loyal as well,” Howard said in an email before the ceremony. Gundlach is also known for his record of bold predictions -- such as his comments, long before the election, that Donald Trump would become president. “Peak anti-Trump has passed,” Gundlach said Thursday. “He’s doing fine. I think the grieving process for the Hillary people is finally starting to progress.” Gundlach was inducted into the FIASI Hall of Fame alongside Dana Emery, the CEO of fixed-income at Dodge & Cox. Past inductees such as Joyce Chang, Ed Altman and Andy Kalotay were on hand. The Society presents events to educate members. “For the massive fixed-income field I think we play an important role driving discussion and addressing issues like liquidity in the markets, regulatory developments, new product areas,” Howard said before the event. “We’ve had big pushes on the whole topic of passive versus active, and we can do it in a way that is not slanted.” The group includes members from European and U.S. banks, rating companies and data vendors. The variety of the membership is a learning opportunity in itself: “At times, Wall Streeters can get silo’d,” Howard said. Both honorees discussed their charitable activities. Emery, 55, in an interview talked about her involvement with Summer Search, which organizes enrichment programs like Outward Bound trips for students who wouldn’t otherwise be able to afford them. Gundlach is supporting a renovation and expansion of the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo. A native of the Buffalo area, Gundlach pledged in June 2016 to give $42.5 million -- the largest cash donation to a cultural organization in Western New York history -- if the museum raised $50 million by Labor Day. The institution raised $60 million by the deadline and renamed itself the Buffalo Albright-Knox-Gundlach Art Museum. Construction is set to begin in 2019 for completion in 2021. Gundlach’s investing comments also touched on skepticism of Amazon.com Inc., which last week agreed to a $13.7 billion acquisition of organic grocer Whole Foods Market Inc. “Amazon will never be able to execute on its business plan,” he said. “You can’t have one retailer.” On cryptocurrency bitcoin, Gundlach sees a coin flip: “It’s either going to zero or a million.”"
2017-06-23T13:31:03.874Z,Buffett Deals and Blockchain Crashes,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-23/buffett-deals-and-blockchain-crashes,"Home Capital. A nice thing about being a celebrity is that people will pay you money just to show up, be yourself, and bestow some of your glamour on whatever they've got going on. Even minor Kardashians can get tens of thousands of dollars to hang out at the club. Similarly, when Warren Buffett shows up at a struggling company and buys a stake, he is immediately rewarded just for being Warren Buffett. This is not just about the terms of the deal -- struggling companies tend to offer Buffett very attractive terms for investing in them -- but also about the subsequent market reaction. So after the close on Wednesday, Home Capital Group Inc. announced that it is getting a C$2 billion credit line from Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc., which is also buying 38 percent of its stock at C$10 a share. The stock closed on Wednesday at C$14.94, so Buffett got a discount, but it closed yesterday at C$19.00: Shareholders were so pleased by Buffett's appearance that they basically threw money at him. In its purest form, once you have a reputation as a smart investor, then every time you buy a stock (and announce it publicly), everybody out there will look and say, ""that is a smart investor,"" and they will buy the stock, and the stock will go up, and you will make money, and everyone will think you are a smart investor because you made money, and it is a virtuous cycle that you can repeat indefinitely. (I mean, it helps if the companies also have good performance, but really you are measured on the stock price, not the underlying business.) ""Boy, when Buffett did this with Goldman Sachs Group Inc., he made a lot of money,"" people think, ""so he must be smart, so I'd better buy some Home Capital stock too."" But as my Bloomberg Gadfly colleague Stephen Gandel points out: Ah, but see, that proves that Buffett was smarter than the rest of the investors. All the more reason to follow what he does! Uber.  You know, I joked the other day that ""Uber Technologies Inc. is applying the principles of the 'sharing economy' to the job of its chief executive officer,"" after it announced that CEO Travis Kalanick would take some personal leave and the company would be run by a flock of 14 executives in his absence. Now Kalanick has resigned, and the board has to go look for a full-time CEO, which will not be the easiest hole to fill. FT Alphaville has a fake job listing for the next Uber CEO, a job that will require ""putting out dumpster fires and leading businesses as they pivot from ‘hot mess’ to ‘performatively woke.’"" Also the candidate ""must be a people person — regrettably the company is yet to replace its people with robots."" But the weird truth is that, at the senior level, Uber seems to have mostly replaced its people with ... an absence of people? There is no CEO. There is no chief operating officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer or general counsel. It has had two director resignations in two weeks. ""From autonomous cars ... to autonomous company,"" Hemal Shah tweeted last week. Uber has yet to perfect driverless cars, but it has made surprising progress toward becoming a managerless corporation. (Hopefully it won't crash into a wall!) The expropriators are expropriated. The central gamble of Uber's executives and directors was that they could keep Uber together long enough to get rid of the drivers, introduce autonomous cars, and become profitable. But the drivers have outlasted a lot of the executives and directors. Anyway. ""According to several people close to both Kalanick and Uber investors, Kalanick’s demise was mostly motivated by the board’s goal of bringing Uber public at the highest possible valuation,"" reports Nick Bilton, and did you think it was something else? The mechanism of capitalism is that it often motivates people to do the right thing because it is (popular, and therefore) profitable. That's a good mechanism! (I mean, sometimes.) You can't expect capitalism to motivate people to do the right thing for purely disinterested reasons. They have investors to think about. Elsewhere, Christoper Mims argues that ""even when it steers through that thicket of crises, Uber will have to come to grips with a fundamental vulnerability that is increasingly apparent in the company’s business model."" Aswath Damodaran argues that ""Uber's value, notwithstanding the sturm und drang of the last week, is intact but at a number that is far lower than investors have priced it at recently."" And Alison Griswold argues that Kalanick ""made Uber great"" but that he ""is no longer the leader Uber needs"": One sort of obvious point here is that sometimes the right CEO for a company at one time is not the right CEO for the company at a different time. That is a well-known problem, and it is addressed by having a board of directors who monitor the CEO on behalf of shareholders, and who sometimes step in to fire the once-right-but-now-wrong CEO and replace him with a now-right-though-formerly-wrong CEO. (You might recognize this process from it being how all other jobs work.) But the current era of tech-unicorn founder-worship has enshrined a generation of founders -- Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel -- who will keep voting control of their companies forever and ever and ever. I hope they are always the right CEOs for those companies! Really it is very convenient that Uber figured out that Kalanick was the wrong CEO before it went public with a governance structure that gave him control forever.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain. On Wednesday, the price of ether -- the cryptocurrency of the Ethereum blockchain -- on the GDAX exchange briefly crashed from $328 to $0.10. The story seems to be that there was a big market sell order that blew through a lot of the buy orders on the book, pushing the price down. This triggered forced selling by margin accounts, blowing through the rest of the buy orders until the price hit 10 cents. ""We understand this event can be frustrating for our customers,"" said GDAX, but everything is fine: ""Our matching engine operated as intended throughout this event and trading with advanced features like margin always carries inherent risk.""  The basic appeal of the cryptocurrency revolution, to people like me who are not making any money off of it, is that it is fun to watch people rediscover all of the lessons of financial economics, one at a time, in public. This week's lesson was: ""Don't use market orders for big trades in an electronic market!"" It's an important lesson, and not an obvious one -- people get it wrong in the stock market all the time -- but also pretty niche. ""If you want to avoid flash crashes, stick to limit orders,"" is a useful tip, but not, like, an important organizing principle for a society. There's another lesson here though. Here's a Reddit post from a margin trader highlighting that, in ether, unlike in stocks or bonds, there no margin calls: If you fall below the margin trigger, the broker or exchange doesn't ask you to put up more money; it just liquidates your position. ""An area of thought to think about is whether or not GDAX could have offered margin calls on their margin product,"" writes the redditor, but: The basic idea of blockchain innovation is that it replaces longstanding human institutions of trust and tradition with immutable efficient code. No one needs to trust anyone in the blockchain; everything operates automatically and in public. And bitcoin/blockchain/smart-contract developers really have done impressive work in, as it were, automating trust, replacing trust in humans and institutions with with trust in code. But I suspect there are fundamental limits to that approach. A market in which people trust each other a little bit -- they collateralize loans, sure, and trade electronically, but they occasionally pick up the phone and try to work things out like reasonable humans -- seems likely to be more efficient than a purely trust-free one.  Elsewhere, here is Civil, ""an Ethereum-based, ad-free marketplace for journalism that leverages cryptoeconomics and community governance to enable a radically open approach to fact-based, responsible journalism."" ""Fact-checking-as-a-service enables journalists to pay for valuable crowdediting while ensuring Newsrooms and Stations publish accurate content,"" says a diagram in the associated whitepaper. Sure! Great! What I said above: Sure you can write a whitepaper about replacing trust in venerable human institutions by some sort of blockchain-based proof-of-crowdediting mechanism. But I suspect something will be lost in actually implementing this thinner notion of trust. In any case, on current trends we are about two months away from Money Stuff's multimillion-dollar initial coin offering, to be followed in very short order by my retirement. Stress tests. Everyone passed, congrats. Yesterday's Dodd-Frank Act stress test results are really just the practice stress tests; the real tests are the Comprehensive Capital Analysis and Review tests next week, which will determine which banks are actually allowed to give money back to shareholders, and how much. Also, weirdly, if everyone passes the stress tests that may be a reason to get rid of the stress tests? There are two strands of thinking about the stress tests that I do not quite understand: Either of those things might be true, but neither is, like, a priori true. If the stress tests were perfect -- if they exactly measured a bank's susceptibility to crisis in a recession -- then you'd expect to see more or less the pattern we have seen: Some banks would fail in early years, but they'd learn their lessons, raise more capital, build more robust businesses, and ultimately put themselves in a position to pass the tests reliably every year. All the banks are supposed to pass. And the fact that banks used to fail the tests, but now don't, seems like a sign that the tests are useful; they have motivated the banks to become more robust and better capitalized. If you got rid of the tests, the banks might stop studying. Psychopath CEOs. Here are Tomasz Piotr Wisniewski, Liafisu Sina Yekini and Ayman M.A. Omar on ""Psychopathic Traits of Corporate Leadership as Predictors of Future Stock Returns"": It is funny to think about the mechanism here. There's that study about how ""investment fund managers from poor backgrounds deliver better returns than those born rich,"" which the researchers interpret to mean ""that managers born poor face higher entry barriers into asset management, and only the most skilled succeed."" I wonder if you could tell a similar story here: Maybe it's easier to become a top executive if you're a psychopath, so a non-psychopath CEO had to work harder and demonstrate more skill to succeed? Airline cross-holdings. I don't know, man, Qatar Airways is planning to buy up to 10 percent of American Airlines Group Inc.'s stock on the open market, because everyone insists on making the airline industry a weird laboratory for the effects of corporate cross-holdings on competition. ""American Chief Executive Doug Parker, in an interview Thursday, he was 'not happy' about the prospect and found the approach 'puzzling and strange.'"" He wants his shares to be owned by the shareholders of other airlines, not by other airlines directly. Elsewhere, here is Einer Elhauge on ""The Growing Problem of Horizontal Shareholding."" How's Martin Shkreli doing? Great, terrific, thanks for asking: His trial for criminal securities fraud starts next week, and as these things go he has a pretty great defense: The prosecutor pointed out -- correctly, though humorlessly -- that giving investors their money back is not a perfect defense to fraud. (""Fraud, she said, can mean depriving investors of a right to control their assets."") Still, it's impressive. When he was first indicted, I said: I would be tempted to acquit, though I suppose after a few days of Shkreli smirking from the defense table I might change my mind. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. They're extremely unworried, even: People are worried about bond market liquidity. Here is Alexandra Scaggs on proposed tweaks to the supplemental leverage ratio that ""would allow banks to intermediate transactions in the Treasury and repo markets more easily.""  People are worried about unicorns. Uber, obviously. (And: ""Lyft’s Goal: Gain From Uber’s Stumbles Without Gloating."") But in not-so-much-tech unicorn news: ""Justin Trudeau Hugs a Puppet Unicorn in a Beautiful Universe Much Like Our Own.""And here's a crying unicorn candle. Things happen.

By now everyone's heard of Bitcoin, and probably has an opinion on it. But the world of cryptocurrencies has a new object of fascination: ICOs. Whereas the tech boom in the 90s was characterized by an obsession with IPOs, these ICOs (initial coin offerings) are cryptographic tokens being sold onto the market for hungry investors eager to get in on new ventures. And while some ICOs are connected to companies, others are connected to ""protocols"" that aren't even recognizably corporations. Confused? You're not alone. On this week's episode, we talk to Chris Burniske of asset management company Ark Invest to talk about this fascinating new world.  "
2017-06-19T13:33:52.372Z,Grocery Deals and Bond Ethics,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-19/grocery-deals-and-bond-ethics,"Whole Foods. You can tell a sort of satisfying shareholder-activism story about Amazon.com Inc.'s acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc. Whole Foods came under pressure from shareholder activists like Jana Partners LLC. Its chief executive officer John Mackey complained bitterly in a Texas Monthly interview about how the activists were ""greedy bastards"" who ""just want to sell us, because they think they can make forty or fifty percent in a short period of time,"" and he bemoaned the short-term time horizons and myopic shareholder-value focus of public-company shareholders. And then he sold his company to Amazon, a company with a geological time horizon, a company that embraces bold experiments, ""a charitable organization being run by elements of the investment community for the benefit of consumers."" Given that Mackey talked about his battle with activists as a ""morality play between conscious capitalism and greedy, short-term financial capitalism,"" Amazon seems like an obvious fit, though I suppose there are some cultural differences: It seems to me that the robots are superficial and the long-term focus is essential. Here is Farhad Manjoo's guess at what will happen next: Doesn't that sound so soothing? Don't fire your managers and put in place an urgent cost-cutting plan to focus only on the highest-margin businesses: Keep everything the same, but play around with it, with no particular plan, until you find something you're happy with. Just focus on making customers happy and don't worry too much about the numbers. Whatever Amazon's ethos is -- and I am not sure it is quite ""conscious capitalism"" -- it certainly isn't short-termist.  Whole Foods, on this theory, was undervalued by the short-term-oriented public markets, and properly valued by the long-term-oriented Amazon, so there was a value-enhancing trade to be done by moving its ownership from the public markets to Amazon. Jana are greedy bastards, sure, but they also brokered a trade that made everyone better off: The public shareholders got a lot of money fast, while Whole Foods avoids all that glare. Of course ""Jana stands to make around $400 million,"" so it is a satisfying result for them too. It is not an entirely happy story: If it is true that public markets are structurally short-termist, that they cannot properly value companies with long-term visions, then that is a sad fact about our markets. It can't be entirely true, though. Amazon itself is public, and investors seem to like it just fine. Oh, by the way, everything Mackey said in his cantankerous Texas Monthly interview came true immediately. The complaints about Jana's short-term greed led immediately to a short-term gain for Jana, but also: Well, Goldman ended up advising Amazon, and ""has the coveted 'lead left' role on a $13.7 billion bridge loan that ranks among the year’s biggest deal-related financing packages."" The value of being insulted in print by John Mackey seems to be hundreds of millions of dollars. Venezuela. I like this guy's attitude: If only every unethical action were also unprofitable, no one would ever have to worry about ethics! But here we are. Baur appears in an article about Venezuelan bonds, which, on the one hand, support ""the authoritarian government of President Nicolás Maduro,"" who ""is choosing to pay lenders rather than feed its people,"" but which, on the other hand, are very profitable: It is a central ethical dilemma: ethics, or money? ""We have a fiduciary duty to represent the interests of our shareholders in our Emerging Markets Debt fund,"" says one fund that owns the bonds, which I guess is one way to avoid the dilemma. It's not you, it's your shareholders! The managers pick the bonds, but don't own them; the shareholders own the bonds, but don't pick them; everyone avoids ethical responsibility. But the dilemma is a deep one. I am reminded of this post on socially responsible investing from Cliff Asness: It is a structural feature of finance: Things that are shunned have to promise higher returns in order to attract capital. This is good, as Asness points out: It makes it more expensive to be shunned, which is the point of the shunning. It is harder for the Maduro regime to stay in power if it can't raise money. But of course the higher returns are higher returns. The more unattractive an investment is ethically, the more attractive it has to be financially. The dilemma is always hard. The market is efficient; there are no free lunches; the more ethically important it is for you to pass up an investment, the more painful it will be to pass up its returns. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Here is a story about how you can't actually buy anything with bitcoin: I think that for most digital-currency enthusiasts this is not a particularly insurmountable problem. Obviously you can't buy things with bitcoins, but that was never the idea. (I mean, now, in hindsight, that was never the idea.) The point of bitcoin is that it is a digital asset, a store of value, a means of transferring large amounts of money across borders -- not a way to pay for a pack of gum. The success of bitcoin is measurable in its market capitalization -- it sure is storing a lot of value! -- rather than its transaction volume -- it sure isn't paying for a lot of gum! And, you know, fine, Apple Inc. is a successful company even though it's a pain to use Apple shares to buy gum. Still it is a bit disappointing for blockchain utopians. The true blockchain-utopian idea involves putting a huge chunk of economic activity on ""the blockchain,"" for some blockchain; the universality is part of the appeal. Bitcoin's uselessness in everyday transactions isn't just a mark against bitcoin as a currency; it's a mark against the blockchain as a universal mechanism for effecting and recording transactions. Turns out it's slow and expensive for everyone in the world to keep an encrypted ledger of every transaction! Elsewhere, here's another story about Brooklyn's blockchain-based artisanal electricity microgrid, which we have discussed previously. ""Oh, this is shared economy,"" says a member. ""This is Airbnb, this is Uber, this is 21st century."" Are hedge funds doomed? Ha, no: It is one of the great puzzles of modern finance: Every article you read about hedge funds discusses poor returns, excessive fees, client dissatisfaction, an endangered business model, titans of the industry closing up shop to become family offices, etc. Also assets under management keep going up. Elsewhere: ""Hedge-Fund Revival Quickens as Event-Driven Trades Prosper."" Corporate crime. Here is Samuel Buell of Duke University School of Law on the problem of unsatisfying punishment for corporate crime: The natural reaction is ""well, throw the managers in jail too then,"" but Buell correctly resists that temptation: The Goldman alumni network. Here is Max Abelson on two former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. bankers who are running for political office as progressive Democrats: Is that true? I guess a little; disclosure, I am a Goldman Sachs alumnus with a reflexive respect for fellow elites. But Steve Bannon is a Goldman Sachs alumnus in the White House with a reflexive disdain for those elites. Gary Cohn is a Goldman Sachs alumnus in the White House with a ... I don't know, a vague half-baked sense that the big banks should be broken up? Goldman is a big institution, and for large portions of the last few decades it served as a sort of default finishing school for ambitious people. Its influence and network are probably best understood as being like the influence and network of, say, Harvard: It selects a lot of people who will probably be powerful later, marinates them in elitism for a little while, and then spits them out to eventually become powerful and reminisce fondly about their days at the old firm. There is not much in the way of a shared ethos, other than that a lot of Goldman alums share a belief in their own elite status.  Lunch with Buffett. How much would you pay to have lunch with Warren Buffett? He auctions a lunch every year, and people pay millions of dollars for it. The appeal, generally, is not the food; it's the chance to talk to Buffett about investing, to get his wisdom firsthand, or to validate your own investing prowess by spending so much money to hang out with him. But what on earth is this, Deutsche Bank? I don't know where to begin with this. This is not how anything works. First, of course, Buffett's secret is not whisperable; it's about reading a lot of 10-Ks and having a huge insurance float and getting pitched a lot of attractive deals, not just buying stocks that start with the letter K or whatever. Second, as reader Jianchi Chen points out by email, you wouldn't pay $3.5 million now to get $3.5 million in 23 years. If that deal sounds appealing to you, why didn't you instead pay me $100,000 and I'll have coffee with you and explain the time value of money. Third, Buffett's ""secret"" is backwards-looking: Buffett, by hypothesis, knows how to get 19 percent annual returns over the past 50 years, not the next 50 years. Of course, if he could give you that secret -- the secret of time travel -- you should pay more than $3.5 million for it, but you should also make more than 19 percent annualized with it. People are worried about unicorns. We talked on Friday about reports that Amazon.com Inc. might buy Slack Technologies Inc., the meta-unicorn that is always raising money just because it is so pleasant to raise money these days. ""I guess if Slack sells, that might be a sign that the party is coming to an end,"" I said. Well, just kidding, Slack is just gonna raise some more money instead: Elsewhere, Casper Sleep Inc., the Ghost Unicorn, has raised $170 million in an investment round led by Target Corp., and is contemplating an initial public offering, while Bonobos Inc., the Chimp Unicorn, sold itself to Wal-Mart Stores Inc. for $310 million. I guess neither of those are unicorns. They're not billion-dollar companies, for one thing, and ghosts and apes are not unicorns, for another. Also they are not tech companies: Casper makes mattresses, and Bonobos makes pants. And yet they are obviously tech companies. They exist in proximity to the internet. Casper advertises on podcasts.

2017-06-20T18:44:23.261Z,Digital Coin Euphoria Wipes Away Tech Selloff for Nvidia and AMD,"Beth Mellor
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-20/digital-coin-euphoria-wipes-away-tech-selloff-for-nvidia-amd,"The two-week selloff in tech shares that wiped hundreds of billions in value from the sector’s biggest names is over for two of the highest flying chipmakers. Nvidia Corp. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. have all but erased losses that began June 8, with each rallying at least 5 percent in the past two days, even as broader measures of tech shares remain more than 2 percent from recent highs. These Companies Stand to Gain the Most Amid Digital Coin Rush Thank cryptocurrency miners for the latest round of bullishness, says Pacific Crest Securities analyst Michael McConnell. They’re buying up Nvidia and AMD graphics cards in an attempt to unlock the code to digital coins like ether and bitcoin. “The sharp increase in demand from cryptocurrency miners has rapidly depleted excess channel inventory” for Nvidia and AMD graphics cards, the analyst wrote in a note to clients Tuesday. “Surging demand from cryptocurrency miners in China and Eastern Europe since early May” will boost quarterly unit sales by as much as 20 percent, the analyst predicted, a sharp turnaround from his prior forecast that saw at least a 10 percent contraction in sales. McConnell joins a growing list who are considering the impact on chip sales from computer scientists mining for digital currencies. Earlier this month, Bank of America Corp. analyst Vivek Arya raised Nvidia’s price target to a Street-high of $185, citing the use of the semiconductor company’s graphics processing units (GPUs) for mining as part of his thesis. GPUs aren’t powerful enough yet for the complexity of mining bitcoin, but Nvidia and AMD are reportedly working on GPUs specifically for this. The Pacific Crest analyst upgraded Nvidia to sector weight Tuesday, the equivalent of a hold, while raising quarterly estimates for AMD. Nvidia added 1.4 percent to $159.08 as of 2:10 p.m. in New York, within pennies of erasing a 6.5 percent slump since June 8, when it closed at an all-time high. It’s rallied nearly 50 percent this year. AMD pushed its two-day rally to 13 percent, enough to erase the effects of six-day rout. Still, McConnell noted that the boost in demand from miners may not be sustainable, saying that “desktop graphics card manufacturers are skeptical,” in light of a similar surge in demand in 2013 during another period of bitcoin euphoria that had no long-term effect on chipmaker sales. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. analyst Toshiya Hari isn’t convinced either, and reiterated a sell rating on AMD earlier this month."
2017-06-20T13:35:11.062Z,Bank Relationships and Index Rules,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-20/bank-relationships-and-index-rules,"Relationships. The basic business of banking is relationships, and a basic fact about relationships is that they are imprecise things. You do not give a company a loan, or buy its chief executive officer a steak dinner, in exchange for a merger mandate. You give the company a loan, and you buy the chief executive a steak dinner, to build a sense of loyalty. Then, later, the company gives you a merger mandate, out of loyalty. The difference is in how you feel about it: Ideally -- and this ideal is not always achieved -- but ideally you both feel like you have a mutual relationship of trust and support, rather than a cold soulless accounting of inflows and outflows. You do not account for your friendship. I mean, you do! If you are a relationship banker covering a company, you probably do get scored internally on how much you spend on loss-leading products and how much you bring in in revenue. But you try not to think about it in your day-to-day relationship, and if that accounting is unpleasant, you find ways to soften it in your mind. ""Sure I have bought this CEO a lot of steak dinners and not won any merger mandates,"" you tell yourself and anyone who will listen, ""but she has given me a lot of insight into her industry at those steak dinners, which I will use to win merger mandates from other companies,"" or whatever, I don't know, you'll think of something good. The point is that you are trying to win business by convincing the CEO that you are her friend, but you are probably also convincing yourself that you're her friend. Or not; this is a sort of idealized and old-fashioned description, and the financial world is becoming ever more impersonal and transactional. But a key insight of the old relationship model is that relationships are complex and multifaceted and hard to reduce to a single easily digestible statement of sources and uses of cash. And it would be a little crass to do so, really: Your relationship is about personal trust and connection, not quid pro quos, and each transaction stands on its own. If you pay $5 million for steak dinners, and get paid $20 million for your merger mandate, then that is a $20 million merger mandate; calling it a $15 million mandate -- netting out the cash flows -- cheapens the relationship. Today Barclays Plc and four former executives have been charged with, and are expected to plead not guilty to, conspiracy to commit fraud around Barclays's 2008 capital raising from Qatar. I have no idea what went on in that deal, and no views on anyone's guilt or innocence, but I suppose the court in that case will have to give some consideration to how banking relationships work. Here are the U.K. Serious Fraud Office news release and Barclays's statement. Here's the issue: Indexing. Is Facebook Inc. a company? Hmm: Let's say you want to invest in the entire U.S. stock market. The Russell 3000 index, which covers about 98 percent of the U.S. public stock market, is a reasonable proxy for that. So you might buy a Russell 3000 index fund. But let's say you also think that Good Governance Is Good, and that dual-class shares are bad. Then you might ... well, you might do a lot of things. One thing you could do is buy the Matt 2997 index fund that I just made up, which buys all of the stocks in the Russell 3000 except Alphabet, Facebook and Ford. Or if you are a big institutional investor you can replicate that yourself: Just look at a list of the Russell 3000 stocks, observe which ones have dual-class shares, and buy the rest of them.  Then one of three things will happen: Any of those things would be fine, really! This is life, and investing: You make choices, and sometimes your choices work out well, and sometimes they don't. But of course the passive-investing revolution is about not making choices, so making this choice is awkward. You can't just buy 2997 of the Russell 3000 stocks, especially if the omissions are as big as Alphabet and Facebook. That would be active management, and your belief that Active Management Is Bad is even stronger than your belief that Good Governance Is Good. So the trick is to get FTSE Russell to make the choice for you: If the Russell 3000 doesn't contain dual-class stocks, then you can just buy the index, avoid those stocks, and neither outperform nor underperform the index. This is purely cosmetic: Facebook and Alphabet still exist, and if you invest in the Neo-Russell 3000 and they outperform it, then you have still missed out on performance by not buying their shares. But it is performance that you don't care about, because your performance is measured against the index, not against the actual universe of all investable stocks. So you're fine, as long as FTSE Russell makes the decision that you want it to make.  ""'The future of the markets are at stake,' said James Andrus, an investment manager at the California Public Employees’ Retirement System,"" and it's an extraordinarily silly thing to say. He works for Calpers! They have a lot of money! They can just buy the stocks that they think are good and not buy the stocks that they think are bad! They don't have to outsource that decision to FTSE Russell, and then lobby FTSE Russell desperately to make the decision they want! They can just make the decision they want! But they can't, because that would be Active. Elsewhere, ""MSCI will decide on Tuesday whether to include Chinese domestic stocks in the benchmark emerging markets index"": Bancor is fun. Initial coin offerings by ... blockchain ... things ... are all the rage these days, and a recent huge one was done by a ... blockchain ... thing ... called Bancor, which raised over $140 million dollars in its ICO. Bancor is fascinating! It is a cryptocurrency built on top of the Ethereum platform that will provide a platform for people to build more cryptocurrencies. I think. Here is a delightful blog post from Emin Gün Sirer and Phil Daian making fun of it. They start with Bancor's fondness for economics-y buzzwords: There are a lot of ways to end that sentence, of which ""we both have credit cards"" and ""you can't really trade rabbits on the blockchain"" would be excellent sensible ones. Sirer and Daian go with ""one can always use ether as a medium of exchange,"" which, you know what, fine, on the Ethereum blockchain, one can always use ether as a medium of exchange, sure. (""Move Over, Bitcoin. Ether Is the Digital Currency of the Moment,"" is the New York Times headline.) There is much fun cryptocurrency and economics and computer-science stuff in their post, but what I particularly loved about it was the market-structure stuff. One innovation of Bancor -- described in its white paper -- is a smart-contract-based automatic market maker. Let's say you are setting up a distributed cloud-storage network and offering your own digital token -- StuffCoin -- to allow people to buy and sell cloud storage. You sell a bunch of the StuffCoins to early adopters, and then you use a portion of the proceeds to establish a ""reserve"" fund to basically stabilize the price of your coin. The reserve fund -- which is denominated in Bancor's own tokens, called ""BNT"" -- is maintained by a smart contract that acts as a market maker; if people want to buy StuffCoins, it will sell them, at ever-increasing prices; if people want to sell StuffCoins, it will buy them, at ever-decreasing prices.  It's a Treynor market maker implemented via smart contract! (I mean, its algorithm for changing prices isn't quite the classical Treynor one, but it's the same basic idea.) Of course computer implementations of market making are nothing new; the basic idea of high-frequency trading in financial markets is that you program a computer to follow some sort of simple market-making algorithm. But doing it by smart contract -- having the market maker be just a pot of money with rules attached, rather than a trading firm that happens to use computers -- does seem novel. Also: not a great idea? At least, not with such simple rules, which Sirer and Daian criticize on straightforward market-structure grounds. For one thing, if there is new information, then the ""true"" market price of StuffCoins might crash from 20 BNT to 5 BNT, while the actual market price that the market maker pays will creep down slowly: And: Anyone who has followed debates about high-frequency trading, or about bond market liquidity, should recognize these issues. The classical market-making function works really well when prices fluctuate around a stable value; it works more poorly when prices move rapidly in one direction. Classical market-making is not a good strategy to follow in a panic, which is one reason that high-frequency traders sometimes turn off their computers during crashes -- and why some people are skeptical that banks would really step in to support bond prices in a crisis. Everyday liquidity provision in a stable market is different from trading against a crisis, whether in stocks or currencies or bonds or blockchain tokens. Also, of course, if you build a predictable algorithm, people will game it -- and if you build an algorithm that reacts slowly to new information, people who react more quickly to that information will pick it off. Leaky brokers. We talked a little last year about this paper, by Marco Di Maggio, Francesco Franzoni, Amir Kermani and Carlo Sommavilla, finding that ""an important source of alpha for fund managers is the access to better connections rather than superior skill"": Investors who trade through brokers with good trading networks get higher returns than those who trade through less-central brokers. Here is a new version of the paper with more fun results: Ha!  Ha! One thing that all activist investors believe is that their brokers are leaking their trades; it turns out they're right. How's Martin Shkreli doing? ""Amazing,"" is the only possible answer, based on this story about his lawyer's recent effort to get his bail reduced: I like that Shkreli's lawyer, in his securities fraud case, is defending him by saying, well, you know, he just makes a lot of ""preposterous promises"" to make people rich, but it's not like they're ever going to see any of the money.  Slot machines. Yeah, I'm with her: Look, casinos: You control the slot machines. You have programmed them to take a dollar of Bookman's money and give her back 95 cents. It is a great business, one with essentially risk-free profits. All you have to do -- but it is crucial -- is not blurt out ""here's $43 million!"" If you can't manage that, you don't deserve to keep the $43 million.  People are worried about unicorns. One popular unicorn worry this week is that Lyft Inc., the Not-Quite-Ubercorn, is reinventing the bus: Elsewhere Blue Apron Holdings Inc., the Pre-Portioned Unicorn, probably wishes it had gotten its initial public offering done before Amazon bought Whole Foods: Things happen.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-15/bitcoin-tumbles-most-in-more-than-two-years-after-record-run,"Bitcoin sank as much as 19 percent, putting the digital currency on pace for its worst week since January 2015, as volatility climbs following a record-setting surge in the price. After flirting with $3,000 on Monday, the cryptocurrency has retreated to as low as $2,076.16 in intraday trading. Other digital coins are also falling. The decline coincides with a slide in technology stocks that began after a report from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. warned that low volatility in the biggest tech stocks may be blinding investors to risks like cyclicality and regulation. One of Goldman Sachs’s technical analysts, Sheba Jafari, sent out a note early this week saying bitcoin was poised for a reversal. Analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a report on Wednesday that bitcoin needs government acceptance and regulation in order to keep climbing. A Senate bill that targets money laundering and terrorist financing has also drawn criticism this week from some bitcoin enthusiasts, who say the proposed legislation is draconian. The bill, which was introduced in May, includes a section that singles out digital currencies and prepaid access devices. Many of bitcoin’s cousins, like ripple, NEM and monero, have also struggled in the last week, while the price of ethereum -- the second-largest cryptocurrency -- has increased 20 percent as investors speculate whether it can nab the top spot. The weakness in bitcoin’s price also began after digital currency exchange Coinbase experienced an outage Monday due to high trading volume. The interruption followed a slew of recent performance issues that have frustrated users. The exchange said today on its website that it’s investigating issues with load times, and customers ""may be unable to load or log in to the website during this time."" Read more on how bitcoin is perplexing analysts Ben Terry, a bitcoin investor who works at an impact investment firm in Kentucky, was unable to purchase more of the cryptocurrency due to the outage. Coinbase may not be very reliable, but it’s the most reliable option, he said. ""If there was another competitor, I would jump ship in a heartbeat,"" said Terry, who started buying bitcoin about a month and a half ago. ""There’s just not a lot out there."" Bruce Fenton, the founder of Atlantic Financial and a board member at the Bitcoin Foundation, isn’t too concerned about Coinbase’s performance problems. ""Coinbase issues are just typical growing pains,"" Fenton said. ""When the whole financial system is upended, it’s bound to have some bumps in the road."" Another exchange, Bitfinex, tweeted Tuesday that it was under DDoS attack, raising questions about the safety of using cryptocurrencies. Last year, Bitfinex had $65 million stolen by hackers. Bitcoin followers have pointed to numerous other factors that may be contributing to this week’s underperformance, such as the Federal Reserve’s interest-rate hike yesterday. ""The decline coincided with the closure of millions of dollars in long positions on OKCoin, one of the major leveraged bitcoin exchanges, a development that likely exacerbated the decline,"" cryptocurrency research company CoinDesk wrote in a June 12 article."

Investors fear Fed policy error, Bank of Japan on deck, and China's Treasury holdings rise to six-month high. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. The shrinking spread between yields on short and longer-term U.S. debt is front-and-center in markets. The bond market is signaling the Federal Reserve may be committing a policy error by continuing to raise its policy rate in the face of below-target—and decelerating—inflation. The divide between monetary policymakers and fixed-income markets suggests traders are trying to dissuade the central bank from following through on its tightening plans. The Bank of Japan is slated to deliver its interest rate decision on Friday, with economists expecting the central bank to keep its policy rate and 10-year yield target unchanged at -0.1 and 0 percent, respectively. What may change, however, is how many bonds the Bank of Japan aims to purchase per year after Governor Haruhiko Kuroda admitted that the pace of purchases has fallen meaningfully shy of its annual target. The governor will hold a press conference at 3:30 p.m. Tokyo time. Shares of Japanese exporters struggled Thursday and could be in for a rough time Friday if the Bank of Japan makes any reference to an exit strategy from its unprecedented unconventional easing program. In April, China's holdings of U.S. Treasuries rose to their highest level since October, the third consecutive monthly increase. Roughly $1.09 trillion in American debt is owned by the Chinese. Earlier this month, reports surfaced that the world's second largest economy was ready to add to its hoard of Treasuries as its currency stabilized. China's central bank declined to follow the Fed in hiking rates on Thursday, a switch from the last time Janet Yellen and her counterparts delivered an increase in March. The technology-centric selloff is back on. Benchmark U.S. equity indexes declined Thursday, with mega-cap tech names leading the way down. Oil prices continued to retreat with West Texas Intermediate futures falling as low as $44.22 per barrel. Shares of social media company Snap Inc. briefly touched their March IPO price before rebounding on heavy volume. Despite the retreat in U.S. risk assets, the Japanese yen was the worst-performing G10 currency Thursday. Nikkei 225 and S&P/ASX 200 futures are in positive territory as of 5:30 a.m. Tokyo time after both indexes gave back ground the prior session. Asia Pacific stocks stumbled Thursday, with particularly poor showings from energy companies. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."
2017-06-15T13:35:27.017Z,Blockchain ICOs and Uber CEOs,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-15/blockchain-icos-and-uber-ceos,"ICOs. Is there a good way to think about initial coin offerings? The idea of an initial coin offering is that a company builds, or promises to build, some blockchain-based platform that allows people to buy or sell some product or service. (It seems like it's usually cloud storage.) And then it creates a digital token -- its own ""coin"" -- that you have to use to buy or sell the product. And then it sells the coins, all at once, to the public, often before the product is fully up and running; the buyers can use the coins to buy the product, or try to sell them to someone else for a profit. And then the company goes to conferences to gloat about how it has disrupt ed the venture-capital funding model and shown the way to the future of capitalism and so forth: One thing you could think about is what this tells us about how businesses should be funded. Most companies want to sell a product, don't have enough money to build it, and so go to investors to get the money. Then they build the product, sell it to customers, get money from the customers, and give some of the money back to the investors. Raising money from customers rather than investors, as ICOs notionally do, has some obvious appeal: It cuts out the middleman, in a sense, and it also lets the company share some of its profits with early-adopter customers rather than investors. The company and the customers are necessary components to the system; the investor, in the new model of blockchain capitalism, is just an interloper, and can be dispensed with. On the other hand, if a company has raised tens of millions of dollars by pre-selling its product to customers before ever building the product, why would it build the product? This is a problem for investors too -- if a company has raised tens of millions of dollars by selling shares to investors before ever building a product, why not run off to Belize rather than build the product? -- but there is a well-developed set of legal protections for investors, for exactly that reason. The legal status of coin-buying customers is a little vaguer. Another thing you could think is: Well, is it vaguer? One obvious worry about ICOs is that some of them might ""really"" be securities offerings, that ""coins"" are in many cases just quasi-equity interests in blockchain-based businesses and should be subject to all of the standard securities regulations. Here is a December white paper on the subject, but one overly simplistic and not-at-all-legal-advice way of thinking about it is: If customers are buying coins as a way to fund their eventual purchase of cloud storage or whatever, then the coins are not securities, but if speculators are buying coins as a way to profit from the growth of the business (or the speculative frenzy around ICOs), then they probably are, and are probably subject to securities regulation. Which do you think it is? One way to tell the story is that bitcoin demonstrated definitively that a privately created digital currency can become worth tens of billions of dollars based solely on ... I don't know, based solely on some sort of psycho-sociological thing that you can give your own name to: ""trust"" would be a good word to fill in the blank, or ""widespread acceptance,"" or ""speculative frenzy"" would work almost as well. Everyone vaguely knew that -- it's how, like, dollars work -- but bitcoin demonstrated it in a particularly pure and salient way.  But it's hard to repeat that pure feat: ""Bitcoin will replace fiat currency"" is a good pitch for a new cryptocurrency, but ""mattcoin will replace ether which will replace bitcoin which will replace fiat currency"" is less compelling. But you can tap into it obliquely. If you are a company with a digital product, or an idea for a product, you can yoke that product to the bitcoin phenomenon: ""Buy one unit of cloud storage and we'll throw in five free units of speculative frenzy!"" And people who want cloud storage might buy your coins, or not. (There are other cloud storage companies.) But people who want speculative frenzy will definitely buy your coins, because initial coin offerings are the main way to get in-on-the-ground-floor bitcoin-style speculative frenzy these days. By the way, I say ""it's usually cloud storage,"" but in fact there are ICOs for all sorts of internet businesses, and some not-quite internet businesses: Here's the website, which is perhaps not entirely safe for work. I was vaguely hoping that the club would exist entirely on the blockchain -- that would be innovative! -- but no, there seems to be a physical location.  Uber. I like that Uber Technologies Inc. is applying the principles of the ""sharing economy"" to the job of its chief executive officer: It's the future of work! No one has a full-time job; you just set your own schedule based on supply and demand. Need some extra money? Be CEO of Uber for a couple of hours in the morning, after dropping your kids off at school. You're a night owl? Run Uber between midnight and 4 a.m. ""Surge pricing"" means that you'll get paid more for being the Uber CEO at high-demand times, like during board meetings or in the wake of public-relations disasters. Really they should build an app, and if an Uber employee needs a chief executive officer, she can open up the app and it will tell her like ""your CEO will arrive in four minutes,"" and then nine minutes later one of the ""14 senior executives"" who are holding down CEO Travis Kalanick's spot in his absence will show up at her office and make an executive decision, and she will rate him from one to five stars.  Whoever deals with this will presumably get surge CEO pay: And Naked Capitalism has Part Ten (!) of Hubert Horan's series predicting Uber's doom: ""Uber’s narrative that its powerful business model will inevitably achieve global dominance is no longer credible and can no longer divert public attention from Uber’s dismal economics."" Bad loans. Here's a story about how Prosper Marketplace Inc. and LendingClub Corp. ""don’t always check whether borrowers are lying to them, and if they find errors in an application, they may still approve the loan"":  Doesn't that seem ... fine? Like, in theory, I mean. Lending, as a business, is essentially statistical; the point is not to have all your loans pay off, but to have enough of them pay off that your losses are covered by the interest that you charge. Even if you verify income on every loan, some of those loans will default anyway. And while verifying income, or whatever, on every loan might help your statistics, you don't have to believe that a priori. You could just test it out: Your machine learning could look at the statistics and tell you, you know what, if you skip verification on half your loans, your default numbers won't go up materially. Of course you could still be wrong: But never mind that. One basic tension in modern finance is that the financial industry largely thinks of itself in statistical terms, while regulators and the public tend to think about individual cases. When Wells Fargo fired 5,300 employees for opening fake accounts, the public was aghast, but Wells Fargo executives ""received the figure positively, believing it proved that a vast majority of individuals were behaving appropriately."" Banks and securitizers and online loan marketplaces know that there will be defaults, and want to optimize the level of defaults for maximum profit. The public wants lenders to take appropriate care with each loan.  Bad LinkedIn. ""It’s Probably Not Okay to Send Naked Pictures on LinkedIn,"" is the headline here, but that is actually a novel and interesting legal question. I mean, it is a straightforward and obvious question of aesthetics and internet etiquette -- it is not okay to send naked pictures on LinkedIn! -- but the legal question is, if you send naked pictures on LinkedIn, is your company responsible? I don't know about that theory, but the good news is that if it works then employers will have to be much more careful about letting their employees use LinkedIn unsupervised. If this lawsuit leads to widespread workplace bans on LinkedIn, we might all be better off for it. Also here is how this allegedly went down: While I cannot recommend sending nudes on LinkedIn, I will admit that "":( bummer dude"" really is the perfect way to respond to rejection, whether romantic or professional, on LinkedIn. Bad email. There is this prankster who keeps emailing bank chief executive officers pretending to be their colleagues and trying to trick them into saying impolitic things, and they reply with bland politeness, and he gloats ""got 'em again,"" and articles are written about how he tricked the CEOs and exposed flaws in the banks' email security, and I don't know, man. The latest is an exchange with James Gorman of Morgan Stanley, in which the prankster impersonates former U.K. Chancellor of the Exchequer (and Morgan Stanley board member) Alistair Darling, and Gorman is polite and vague. ""Security experts warned that the episodes have exposed weak spots in the big banks’ defences, at a time when they are under near-constant bombardment from criminals, 'hacktivists' and disaffected insiders,"" writes the Financial Times. I tend to take the other side of it: After five attempts, no bank CEO has actually been tricked into saying something inappropriate or giving away any information. Eventually a bank CEO will reply ""hello, I see you are emailing me from a fake email address, so I will not engage any further,"" and the hoaxer will post that exchange online and be like ""yes, another flawless victory!"" Rules-based trading. Here is Robin Wigglesworth on last Friday's sell-off in tech stocks, which he attributes to selling by factor-driven systematic funds that sold off when big tech companies weakened on their momentum and low-volatility factors: We have talked occasionally about the possibility that the modern low-volatility environment might be not so much a sign of complacency as a real evolution in the markets: Stock prices famously overreact to news, but as markets are increasingly run by coldly logical machines, those overreactions will diminish, and stock prices will become less volatile. I guess that is one way to interpret the fact that only 10 percent of trading is done by humans making their own decisions? The other is that volatility is being smoothed day to day but concentrated into the tails: The systematic funds will all flock together, mostly keeping prices smooth and stable, but when they do panic, they will all panic at the same time. Share-count investing. Yesterday I asked: I was half-kidding, but a reader pointed out that in 2015 Muddy Waters Research put out a note arguing that Bolloré SA was undervalued because it had fewer shares than the market thought it had: Muddy Waters forecasted a 95 percent upside, and the stock is actually down almost 10 percent since then, but still, share-count investing: could be a thing. People are worried about vampires. ""No, Peter Thiel is not harvesting the blood of the young,"" is the headline here, and next they will be telling me that he doesn't sleep hanging upside-down from his ankles in a crypt. I ask you: Would you rather live in a world in which Peter Thiel is harvesting the blood of the young, or one in which he isn't? Do you want to be disabused of your belief that Peter Thiel might, just might, get himself injected with the blood of young people to become immortal? What fun is that?  Things happen.

2017-06-13T09:00:00.004Z,Bitcoin Is Helping the Pot Business Get Over Its Banking Problem,"Jennifer Kaplan
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/pot-entrepreneurs-look-to-bitcoin-as-big-banks-stay-on-sidelines,"Cannabis companies are turning to the world’s most popular digital currency in an effort to get rid of all that cash. The inability to access traditional financial institutions is one of the marijuana industry’s biggest impediments. Legal cannabis was a $6 billion industry last year and is expected to grow to $50 billion by 2026, according to Cowen & Co. But because pot is illegal under federal law, big banks and credit-card companies steer clear. That’s forced most merchants to accept cash only, a logistical headache and constant security threat.  Enter bitcoin, the cryptocurrency that consists of digital coins “mined” by computers solving increasingly complex math problems. At least two financial-technology startups, POSaBIT and SinglePoint Inc., use the cryptocurrency as an intermediate step that lets pot connoisseurs use their bank-issued credit cards to buy weed. “There’s no industry -- whether it’s the production and sale of cannabis or the production and sale of a cup of coffee -- that can operate safely, transparently or effectively without access to banks or other financial institutions and traditional services,” said Jon Baugher, co-founder of POSaBIT, whose technology is used by 30 dispensaries in Washington state. “That’s where we thought we could leverage the use of digital currency.” Trove Cannabis, one of the Washington stores using POSaBIT, sold $3 million of marijuana last year -- in cash -- and does close to 3,000 transactions weekly. Trove became a POSaBIT customer in February after being on a waitlist for six months, according to Yin-Ho Lai, Trove’s founder and chief executive officer. Since doing so, about 13 percent of customers have chosen to pay with credit or debit cards, Lai said, and those who do tend to spend more. Here’s how it works:  Once a customer decides on which marijuana product to buy, an employee asks if he or she would like to use cash or digital currency, Lai said. If the buyer prefers the latter, the Trove employee explains that the customer can use a credit card to buy bitcoin through a POSaBIT kiosk, with a $2 transaction fee tacked on.  The customer, who would now own bitcoin equal to the value of the purchase, can then redeem the currency in the store. Or the buyer can keep their bitcoin and use it anywhere else that accepts the currency. If the customer finishes the purchase in the store, POSaBIT, which pockets the transaction fee, then sends the value in U.S. dollars to Trove’s bank account.  POSaBIT says it’s taken steps to comply with federal and state laws regulating both marijuana sales and digital currency. For example, customers must present a valid ID that is scanned, encrypted and stored. Buyers are allowed to acquire no more than $150 in bitcoin to prevent money laundering. The company also has a nine-point fraud-detection program designed to thwart criminals, and requires that its retail customers have a bank account, not necessarily a given in the cannabis industry. Pot is legal for both recreational and medical use in California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine, Alaska and the District of Columbia, and approved in 20 additional states for medical purposes only. While the early bitcoin adopters are claiming success, the currency still has a long way to go before it gains wide acceptance. For many in the legal weed industry, the virtual currency’s association with illicit drug dealing on the so-called dark web is a big drawback. Others have a hard time grasping how a virtual currency works, including Neil Demers, who runs a cannabis store in Denver. At least for now. “I’m sure education could enlighten me and a lot of this industry on bitcoin being a feasible payment option, but we just don’t see it,” said Demers, a franchisee of Diego Pellicer Worldwide Inc., which leases space to pot dispensaries. It may only be a matter of time before pot dealers have an easier solution. The reluctance of banks to handle pot transactions will probably subside before the digital-currency solution has a chance to take off, said Jeffrey Zucker, co-founder and president of Green Lion Partners, a strategy firm focused on early-stage development in the cannabis industry. “The banking issues are going to be solved in such time that the people in this industry are going to gravitate toward traditional banking,” he said. At least some companies say bitcoin technology will make sense in the cannabis industry even after traditional banking becomes available. SinglePoint, a mobile-tech firm that specializes in payments via text message, signed an agreement last week with First Bitcoin Capital Corp. to develop a solution for cannabis and other high-risk industries without access to traditional banking. Two years ago, the Seattle-based company put terminals into dispensaries in Washington. Within six months, however, banks shut them down, citing too much risk, said Greg Lambrecht, founder and CEO. Singlepoint had considered using bitcoin at that time, but the currency wasn’t well known, he said. That’s changed, and Singlepoint now expects retailers to begin testing its new product over the next two months. “It’s not foreign to them now, like some sort of weird scam that they don’t know about,” he said. “More and more establishments are accepting it, but it’s kind of like the wild, wild west.”"

2017-06-15T10:00:00.001Z,Venezuelans Are Seeking a Haven in Crypto Coins as Crisis Rages,"Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-15/venezuelans-are-seeking-a-haven-in-crypto-coins-as-crisis-rages,"Crypto coins’ gyrations require nerves of steel, but to an increasing number of Venezuelans, they’re the safest currency they can own. Demand for digital coins is soaring in Venezuela amid an escalating political crisis that has protesters demanding that President Nicolas Maduro step down. Inflation has spiraled to the triple digits, debasing the bolivar and depleting savings, while citizens struggle to find everything from food to medicine on store shelves. “If you’re going to be in something volatile, you might as well be in something that’s volatile and rising than volatile and falling,” says Ryan Taylor, chief executive officer of crypto currency Dash Core, the third-largest digital coin by number of transactions. “We’re seeing huge demand in Venezuela through inquiries in our support line, as more and more people join our forums and chat rooms, even on how-to Youtube videos that have popped up.” Bitcoin trading volume in Venezuela jumped to $1.3 million this week, about double the amount that changed hands two months ago, according to LocalBitcoins.com, an online exchange which allows users from across the world to swap their local currencies to bitcoin. Users in Venezuela for Cryptobuyer, a platform for bitcoin and Dash trading, jumped to 8,000 last month from 6,000 in the previous month, a record increase, the exchange’s CEO Jorge Farias said. Venezuela’s currency has become nearly worthless in the black market, where it takes more than 6,000 bolivars to buy $1, while bitcoin surged 53 percent in the past month alone. But it’s not just about shielding against the falling bolivar, as some Venezuelans are using crypto currencies to buy and sell everyday goods and services, Farias said. To read more on street protests in Venezuela. “Venezuelans use these alternatives not only to safeguard their savings, but also to be able to operate in daily business and commerce,” Farias said in an email. Digital currencies are “an alternative to entrepreneurs and people who lack the means to buy and sell not only merchandise but services, and to send and receive remittances.” The market is still small though, and far from providing a viable way for Venezuela’s 31 million citizens to escape the current turmoil. Only 62 percent of the population had an Internet connection as of 2015, according to the CIA Factbook, and over 80 percent live below the poverty line. Digital coins as a way to escape currency controls and inflation isn’t a new phenomenon. Argentina saw a spike in bitcoin trading after former President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner banned dollar purchases, and China is one of the main sources of bitcoin demand as traders use the digital currency to skirt capital controls. The London School of Economics created a Bitcoin Market Potential Index based on technology penetration, inflation and financial repression and found that the two countries with the highest BMPI were Argentina and Venezuela, as of last year. Argentina removed currency controls, but inflation is still above 20 percent. “It’s in these locations where the incentives to go into digital currencies is the strongest,” Dash’s Taylor said. “We’re seeing a lot of growth in the region.”"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-14/asset-inflation-jumps-and-fed-policy-makers-are-hamstrung-chart,"The Federal Reserve’s focus on consumer-price inflation, over which it exerts relatively little influence, means it’s ignoring asset prices that are veering dangerously close to bubble territory. The surge in prices this year for virtual currencies such as bitcoin is reminiscent of the technology-stock excess of the late 1990s, and even after a recent selloff, the biggest U.S. tech shares are still up more than 20 percent. Policy makers could rein in the speculation by speeding up the pace of interest-rate increases, but their inflation mandate makes higher borrowing costs harder to justify given that increases remain subdued. — With assistance by Ben Bartenstein"
2017-06-16T11:00:13.703Z,Uber’s CEO Found an Unhappy Compromise,"Eric Newcomer
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-16/uber-s-ceo-found-an-unhappy-compromise,"Travis Kalanick’s leave of absence from Uber Technologies Inc. makes just about everyone unhappy. Whether you want the chief executive officer to stay or go, it’s a disappointment because it tries to split the difference. If you’re a Kalanick loyalist and would like to see him continue to have a big role at the company, this is a moment of weakness. If you think Kalanick is the core problem at Uber, there was a failure to act decisively, and he still remains in the mix. The fact that neither camp is happy only helps fuel the conflict further. Kalanick’s role at Uber remains—by far—the most important factor within the company. If the goal is to put the company’s controversial past behind it, then keeping Kalanick on as CEO seems like it will be a barrier to that, at least so long as there’s a large contingent that thinks he needs to go. Kalanick allegedly played a role in the India rape debacle and attended the South Korean karaoke bar that was the subject of a human-resources claim. He’s CEO of a company that allegedly failed to respond to Susan Fowler’s human-resources complaints. And then, after a more thorough review of personnel infractions, the company fired more than 20 people. Emil Michael, who was ousted as a result of former U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder’s recommendations, wasn’t the guy in charge—just the guy’s closest confidant. Some Uber insiders now believe that if Kalanick wanted to put these scandals behind him, he took the wrong path. He hired Holder to investigate the company and gave his law firm a wide berth to dig into scandals. This eliminated Kalanick’s ability to take credit for the housecleaning. Instead, it looked more like an indictment of his leadership. The public Holder recommendations, which were approved unanimously by the board, diminish Kalanick’s role by giving a lot of the day-to-day decision-making to a still-hypothetical chief operating officer and more power to the board of directors. A lot hangs on the COO. Kalanick is spending much of his time searching to fill the role. Some Uber employees seem to be waiting around hoping this person will be some kind of messiah. After the experience with Jeff Jones, the former Target chief marketing officer who worked as Uber’s president for six months before fleeing, we’ll have to wait and see. It seems like Kalanick could weather the storm here. Sunday’s board meeting may have been the peak moment of vulnerability. It reminds me of another company, Zenefits. In that case, the board basically scared the crap out of the CEO who controlled the company. They convinced him that he could face a lot of trouble for the decisions he’d made and that it would be less painful just to leave. They negotiated a peaceful departure, and then turned around and seemed to pin the blame for everything on him. When a founder has absolute control, that’s the playbook: Put the fear of god in them and hope that they relent. Kalanick is still in the mix, but Uber’s turmoil isn’t nearly over. —Eric Newcomer Sign up to receive the Fully Charged newsletter in your inbox, and follow Bloomberg Technology on Twitter and Facebook for more.

If Trump gets his way in overhauling banking regulations, it would free up some of the billions of dollars in capital that banks were forced to amass after the financial crisis. Less clear is what they’ll do with it. Trump would like banks to plow their windfall back into the economy. Some on Wall Street predict a lot will flow straight into the pockets of shareholders. Summer Fridays are all the rage this year, according to a recent survey. As the hiring market for white-collar workers tightens, companies have turned to benefits as a way to attract and retain workers.

2017-06-15T02:28:16.959Z,"Digital Coins Are So Hot, Startups Are Selling Them Like an IPO","Dune Lawrence
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-15/digital-coins-are-so-hot-they-re-selling-them-like-an-ipo,"David Vorick, 24, is one of those techies with a plan to change the world. His startup runs a data storage service called Sia, similar to those of Amazon.com Inc. and Google Inc. The difference is that Sia is totally decentralized. People who need a digital file cabinet are matched up with hosts with extra storage capacity in an online marketplace that runs on blockchain, the same technology that supports the virtual currency bitcoin. To Vorick, this isn’t just a nifty technical accomplishment but an idealistic challenge to the power of the internet’s oligarchs. “We are really passionate about making this network that is fully independent of anybody who can step in and say, ‘You’re not allowed to use it anymore,’ ” Vorick said last month at a conference in New York. For finance types there’s something else interesting about Sia. To buy storage space—or get paid for it—you need to use the system’s own digital tokens, called Siacoin. And on sites where people trade virtual currencies, Siacoin has surged more than 1,200 percent in U.S. dollar value since May 1. The total value of this startup money was about $400 million on June 13. Other digital coins have also gone through the roof. XRP, the token for a global payment system called Ripple, has increased almost 4,000 percent in the past three months, giving it a market value of about $10 billion. Blockchain businesses don’t always sell their tokens—they may be generated by the system itself. But more and more startups are offering tokens as a way to raise money upfront in so-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), a nod to traditional initial public offerings of securities. So far this year, 63 sales have raised $521 million, according to blockchain research firm Smith + Crown. That has already far surpassed the $260 million raised in 2016, says Emma Channing, general counsel at Argon Group, a year-old digital finance investment bank in Los Angeles. Channing expects well over $1 billion in token sales this year. That’s $1 billion for ... what, exactly? Keeping explanations as simple as possible, blockchain is a way to record transactions and contracts in an online ledger. The ledger isn’t maintained by one controlling system or owner but by an expanding network of computers across the internet. Blockchains can record every time a digital coin, such as a bitcoin, is traded, but they can also keep track of increasingly more complex interactions, ­creating new ways to run everything from insurance to social networks. Some kind of tradable token is increasingly integral to how these new blockchain businesses work. Take the Basic Attention Token (BAT), created by Brave Software, which is attempting to create a better model for online advertising and publishing. BAT is meant for use on the Brave web browser. Brave gives users more control over the advertising they see and lets them get paid for looking at ads. If users like a site, they will be able to reward the publisher using BATs. The tokens could also be used for digital purchases within Brave, such as photos or games. Brave announced an ICO in March, including a detailed explanation of how the system will work, and scored $35 million in less than a minute when the ICO opened—and finished very quickly—on May 31. This kind of fundraising has some obvious appeal for a startup: No more going to a venture capital firm that will take a big chunk of ownership and dictate how you do things. Right now, an ICO looks relatively easy. “It seems as if there’s this enormous financial pressure of money that wants to move into this space, but there’s really limited places for it to go,” says Brian Lio, chief executive officer of Smith + Crown. But an offering that sells out in seconds may work against some of the bigger goals of a blockchain enterprise. Tokens are supposed to be used by customers. “If your token instantaneously sells out to a few institutional investors, you’re missing a big point of tokens, which is to get them to users and build a community,” says Lio. Some of the money sloshing into new coins may be recycled gains from older digital currencies, particularly bitcoin and another called ether. The price of bitcoin has tripled since the beginning of the year, and ether has jumped more than 4,000 percent. Some early investors—“crypto­currency whales,” Channing calls them—have built up a huge store of virtual wealth. Alex Sunnarborg, a research analyst at CoinDesk, estimates that about three-quarters of the money going into ICOs comes from within the crypto-economy. Which may (sort of) explain LGD, the digital token for the Legends Room, which describes itself as “a world class Las Vegas gentlemen’s cabaret ­r­­e-imagined using blockchain technology,” according to the website. It sold about $1 million in LGD in an ICO that closed in May, says Peter Klamka, a consultant who set up the token strategy for the business. For all those with crypto­currency burning holes in their pockets, it’s one way to answer such questions as, “How do you spend it, and what do you get for it? How do you enjoy it?” Klamka says. “You get more than just another ­crypto-asset to sit there and look at on your screen—the first real-world opportunity to actually put your arms around something.” Tokens can be used for discounts on drinks and access to a members-only room and events featuring stars of mixed martial arts. The club is set to open in July. At Token Summit, the conference where Vorick spoke, the atmosphere verged on breathless—slide decks prepared 10 days earlier were already out of date. Still, there was skepticism about the onslaught of the investor class, including from one professional investor. “It’s really awesome to have things be instantly funded and financialized, but I think the investors should be brighter about it,” Richard Craib, founder of the hedge fund Numerai, told the audience. Numerai has a digital coin but didn’t do an ICO. It gave the token to some 16,000 data scientists who model predictions that the company uses to make investments. If a model performs well, meaning real-world gains for Numerai, the scientists who built it get more of the tokens and can exchange them eventually for dollars. Those whose predictions fail lose their tokens. Argon’s Channing spends a lot of her time beating the drum about regulation. ICOs may seem to fall into a legal gray area, but she says the vast majority of tokens count as securities, and if they are sold to investors in the U.S., they fall under the jurisdiction of the Securities and Exchange Commission. A legal standard called the Howey Test defines an investment contract as a security if you are putting money into a common enterprise with an expectation of profit, primarily from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of others. The SEC has yet to wade in, but the hotter the ICO market, the greater the potential for abuse or investor losses that could spur the agency to act. Channing suspects the regulators are waiting for the right case. Meeting requirements for a securities sale will mean selling ICOs to accredited investors with a certain level of sophistication and assets. The eye-popping gains on coins are drawing more attention to them, a classic precondition of a bubble. Lio says there will certainly be corrections to come, though the potential of the technology is real. Along with Siacoin’s higher value, Sia has seen a jump in users. But why the sudden price spike? “I can only speculate,” Vorick told the Token Summit crowd. “The price rise didn’t really correspond to any major announcement that we made.”"
2017-06-16T13:23:38.476Z,Tricky Bots and Lagging Quants,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-16/tricky-bots-and-lagging-quants,"How to trade. Here's what you do: You get yourself some recurrent neural networks, and you have them observe how humans negotiate. Then, once your neural networks have carefully studied human behavior, you set them loose to negotiate with each other. This is what some Facebook Inc. and Georgia Tech researchers did, and it went great: High five, bots! ""Facebook teaches bots how to negotiate. They learn to lie instead,"" says this Wired headline, but why can't it be both? The lesson here might be that an essential element of negotiation -- as practiced by humans and imitated by robots -- is concealing and bluffing about your own objective function, making your counterparty think that you value a thing differently from how you actually value it.  In other news, yesterday a jury mostly acquitted three former Nomura Holdings Inc. traders of fraud for lying to customers about the prices of mortgage bonds, though being mostly acquitted of federal fraud charges is still fairly terrible if you are also convicted a little: Obviously there is a distinction between what the bots did and what the Nomura traders allegedly did: The bots deceived each other about their own subjective valuations of the stuff they were trading online, while the Nomura traders were accused of deceiving customers about actual prices paid to third parties for those bonds. But it seems like the jury was mostly pretty sympathetic to the traders. And why not? ""Deceiving your counterparties about how much something is worth to you isn't fraud,"" the jury might have concluded; ""it's just the essence of negotiation."" I mean, bots figured that out by watching humans negotiate; why wouldn't humans draw the same conclusion? Oh, here's another cool fact about the bot study: ""At one point, the researchers write, they had to tweak one of their models because otherwise the bot-to-bot conversation 'led to divergence from human language as the agents developed their own language for negotiating.'"" That is also familiar to bond traders! I mean, you can read the chats at issue in the Nomura case; they are not always in precisely what you would call ""human language."" ""Ok don't litvak me,"" said a customer to Tyler Peters, referring to another bond-trader-lies case and meaning roughly ""don't lie to me about the price of those bonds."" Like the bots, bond traders have developed their own language for negotiating. Eventually the bots will become clever enough to realize that (1) their counterbots are trying to trick them and (2) they can specify a no-tricking condition. ""Ok don't 7r1x0rbot me,"" one bot will say to another, verbing the name of a particularly notorious trickster bot. The future will be great. Meanwhile. You know who else has taught robots to trade? Everyone, literally everyone, it is the hottest thing going in financial markets; even traditional hedge funds are going quant these days. How's that working out? Still, ""through the first quarter of this year, $4.6 billion of net new money was invested in quant funds, even as over $10 billion was withdrawn from non-quant funds."" And the robots keep getting more important: There are I think two rough ways to think about computers in markets. One is: Artificial intelligence strategies will continually be adapted to more areas of financial decision-making, so that eventually, like, private-equity buyouts and activist campaigns and distressed-debt workouts will be led by packs of recurrent neural networks. The other is: Computers are really good at systematic statistical-arbitrage strategies and less good at, you know, even fundamental equity long-short. In the first model, ""quant"" will become increasingly meaningless as a style and performance category: The world will be quant, and different strategies with different performance records and risk exposures will all be run by computers. But the second model is the world we live in for now, anyway, which probably means that near-term quant cycles will be like cycles in any other investing trend: Quant funds will do well, and money will pour into them, and then they'll do poorly. Elsewhere, here is Josh Brown on the lack of euphoria in the current bull market, which he attributes to basically the fact that robots have taken over the job of being euphoric about bull markets: Indexing. Speaking of passive investing, we talk from time to time around here about how indexing is not as simple as just investing in the entire global portfolio of financial assets: Even if you decide to invest passively, you are making decisions about what asset classes and geographies to allocate to, and even if you rely on indexes, the index providers are making subjective decisions about what counts as ""the market."" There are few clearer examples than China: In some simplistic sense, China has a stock market, and it is big, so if you are passively allocating money to investments then you should be allocating some of it to China. But of course there are practical concerns -- about liquidity and regulatory structures and currencies and so forth -- that might give you pause. The important thing is that you don't get to make those decisions, if you are an indexer: You outsource them to an index provider, and then are stuck with what it decides. Meanwhile, what if you really did just invest in the entire global portfolio of financial assets? You'd make about 4.4 percent a year, according to Ronald Doeswijk, Trevin Lam and Laurens Swinkels: No poaching. I am fascinated by this report that ""the US Department of Justice is scrutinising whether Barclays breached antitrust laws by promising to stop poaching JPMorgan Chase bankers,"" because, like the Litvak and Nomura bond-lying cases, it raises deep questions about the interaction between criminal law and social norms. In 2015 Barclays Plc hired Jes Staley, a senior JPMorgan Chase & Co. banker, to be its chief executive officer, and he quickly brought on a bunch of his buddies from JPMorgan to take senior roles at Barclays. But then he stopped doing that, and the Justice Department is investigating ""whether Barclays entered into a so-called 'no poach' agreement by promising not to hire more JPMorgan bankers.""  What would make those calls criminal? If Dimon said ""don't hire from us and we won't hire from you,"" and McFarlane said ""you have yourself a deal,"" then that would be bad. ""Going forward, the DOJ intends to proceed criminally against naked wage-fixing or no-poaching agreements,"" the Justice Department announced last year, and it noted that informal ""gentleman's agreements"" can still count as criminal conspiracies. (""There have been no improper agreements and we continue to hire from each other,"" says JPMorgan, and Barclays ""insiders vigorously rejected any suggestion that such an agreement was entered into"" and pointed out that it keeps hiring from JPMorgan.) But what if Dimon was like ""hey all this hiring is rude and you should stop,"" and McFarlane was like ""I suppose it is rude, we'll stop."" What if Dimon called McFarlane and just said ""really?"" and waited in silence until McFarlane was like ""yeah, okay, fine."" I have no idea what anyone said to anyone else. But it does seem to me like leaving a senior job at one bank to become the CEO at another, and then poaching a ton of senior people from your old bank all at once, is kind of rude and disruptive to your old friends and colleagues, and you might not want to do it, not because of an illegal ""gentleman's agreement"" but out of a general social sense of gentlemanliness. (Or you might forget your manners, and be reminded, and repent.) What if Barclays really did slow down its hiring of JPMorgan employees because it concluded that there was a social norm against all that hiring? Isn't a ""social norm"" just another name for a ""gentleman's agreement""? Isn't it a shared informal understanding about what should and shouldn't be done? Does that make it an antitrust violation?   Forfeiture. This forfeiture complaint from the 1Malaysia Development Bhd. case is really a perfect shopping list for the modern world; according to the Justice Department, the stuff bought with illicit proceeds of 1MDB-related fraud includes an ""8.88-carat fancy intense pink diamond pendant surrounded by 11-carat fancy intense pink diamonds,"" a bunch of other diamonds, stock in Palantir Technologies and Flywheel Sports Inc., a New York apartment, a movie poster, two movies (rights to ""Dumb and Dumber To"" and ""Daddy's Home""), a Picasso, a Basquiat collage, an Arbus photograph, and a yacht named M/Y Equanimity. I spend a lot of time around here criticizing the naming and nicknaming choices of people caught up in fraud investigations, so it is only fair to say: Whoever bought a yacht named ""The Equanimity"" with money allegedly stolen from a Malaysian sovereign wealth fund is doing it exactly right. That is how you name your supervillain yacht.  On the other hand ... ""Dumb and Dumber To""? This is just a pleasing section heading in a legal brief:   Classics. I was a classics major in college, but I cannot quite agree with this piece arguing that hedge funds shouldn't name themselves after characters from Greek and Roman mythology because those characters did bad things: Nope! Fund managers wouldn't benefit greatly if they were deeply familiar with classical literature, because it's not like their customers are either. The extent of most investors' classical-allusion-due-diligence process is pretty much ""Hermes, sounds Greek, here's a check."" Bulletproofing the classical references in your fund name is more or less impossible -- the Greek gods were shady characters! -- but also a waste of time; classicists probably aren't rich enough to invest with you anyway. Just go ahead and name your fund Priapus Capital and don't worry about it.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain. This might be my favorite blockchain blockchain blockchain story yet, about a Morgan Stanely research note praising Bank of New York Mellon Corp. for its blockchain efforts: So: Bank of New York Mellon is a giant trusted counterparty that keeps a centralized ledger of who owns which securities. It also keeps a backup ledger of who owns which securities. That backup ledger is a ""blockchain,"" but it is centralized (BNY Mellon is in charge of it) and private (""All that's left is to roll out is client-facing portions""). And that's a cutting-edge example of blockchain adoption by financial institutions. The blockchain: Might be a useful way for giant incumbent centralized institutions to back up their data! People are worried about unicorns. Well, there is ""Rape Victim Sues Uber Over Handling of Medical Records,"" ""Travis Kalanick is not ethical enough to steer Uber,"" ""Uber Gaffe Is Latest Drama in Storied Career of Billionaire Bonderman,"" that sort of thing. In non-Uber unicorn news, ""Slack Technologies Inc. has received recent inquiries about a potential takeover from technology companies including Amazon.com Inc."" Slack is a favorite around here because of the meta-unicorn, unicorn-of-unicorns approach that it takes to fundraising: It raises more money than it needs, because there is just so much money available, and then uses some of it to invest in other, less favored startups. ""This is the best time to raise money ever,"" said Slack's CEO in 2015, so he did. I guess if Slack sells, that might be a sign that the party is coming to an end.  Food Stuff. Well here's a food trend for you, I guess. It is called ""breatharianism"": It's from a New York Post article, and I cannot quite tell at what level it is a hoax. Things happen. Amazon to Acquire Whole Foods in $13.7 Billion Bet on Groceries.

2017-06-13T13:26:43.555Z,Bank Regulators and Cyber Ninjas,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-13/bank-regulators-and-cyber-ninjas,"Financial regulation. ""The Trump administration laid out its highly anticipated plan for overhauling bank rules"" yesterday, and it is pretty good I guess? Here is the Treasury Department report, and just as a matter of form, it generally seems to have been written by professionals who are familiar with bank regulation, which I can't say I entirely saw coming. (It ""was spearheaded by Craig Phillips, a former BlackRock Inc. executive who was major fundraiser for Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign."")  As for content, there is a lot of it, and it is fairly miscellaneous, without too many unifying themes. One broad but boring theme seems to be that smallish banks -- below $10 or $50 billion in assets, depending on the provision -- should be exempted from Dodd-Frank stress tests and the Volcker Rule and other rules. I cannot get that excited about small-bank deregulation, but if you are a small bank this report will probably be pretty exciting for you. Another theme that I can perhaps get a bit more excited about is: Treasury is worried about bond market liquidity. This comes up in various places, such as in the leverage ratio and the Volcker Rule, where the report calls for relaxing the ""reasonably expected near term demand"" requirement: Another big subject in the report is the power of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The basic story of the CFPB is that Democrats like it and want it to maintain independent power, and Republicans dislike it and want it to be more subject to political oversight, and you can guess the main thrust of this Republican report. But more interesting to me was the discussion of the CFPB's rulemaking-by-enforcement approach:  UDAAP is ""Unfair, Deceptive or Abusive Acts and Practices,"" but this is a much more general feature of financial regulation: A great deal of regulation is conducted by deciding that a practice was bad and then punishing the people who did it. This puts future people on notice that the practice is now illegal, but the original people -- who did the practice when it was bad, sure, but before it was explicitly declared illegal by the regulators -- might feel a bit hard done by. Wouldn't it be fairer for the regulators to decide that a practice is bad and then announce that it's bad, and punish anyone who does it after that? This is a tricky subject, of course: Bankers are themselves constantly seeking novelty, and if they commit a novelty that really should have been illegal, you can see why the regulators would want to punish them immediately rather than outlaw it prospectively. Still, it is hard to argue with the general principle that people should be punished only if they had reasonable notice that their conduct was unlawful. The DAO hack. ""Remember when I was telling you about that huge unhackable pile of money?"", a man asks his wife in this rollicking story about ethereum and the DAO, and I bet you know where he was going with that! ""'It's been hacked,' he told her."" Sure it was, sure it was. We have talked about the DAO hack before: Basically, some people set up a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" on the ethereum blockchain, a set of smart contracts that were meant to constitute ""a new breed of human organization never before attempted,"" ""borne from immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code."" Except that the code was wrong. Delightfully, the specific problem was in line 666 of the code, which allowed an investor in the DAO to withdraw as much money (well, ether) as she wanted. Someone figured this out and withdrew millions of ether from the DAO before anyone noticed. And then, when they did notice, the DAO developers decided that the best way to protect against this bank robbery was to rob the bank themselves and put the money somewhere safer: ""What does it even mean to hack something"" seems to be the key philosophical question of the DAO episode, and I submit to you that you probably don't want to invest your life savings in projects that raise philosophical questions like that. If your bank ever said to you ""well, what does it even mean to hack something,"" you would worry. You know what it means! It's just that, with the DAO, the code didn't know what it means, and the whole point of the DAO was to substitute the code's judgment for yours. Anyway: cyber ninjas. Again, we have reached a point in the U.S. financial system where major banks almost never communicate with customers by tweeting ""DO NOT PANIC"" in all caps, which is something to consider when you hear blockchain and smart-contract proponents sneering at the backwardness of bank money transfer protocols. The good hackers didn't quite succeed in stealing the money to prevent it from being stolen, but instead other ethereum developers figured out an even better way to prevent it from being stolen, which was by initiating a ""hard fork"" in which everyone on the ethereum blockchain just agreed to forget about the whole incident and put the money back where it had been. (“Some bitcoin users see the hard fork as in some ways violating their most fundamental values,” said ethereum creator Vitalik Buterin. “I personally think these fundamental values, pushed to such extremes, are silly.”) This mostly worked, but not everyone on the ethereum blockchain agreed, so the fork ended up creating two ethereum blockchains: ""ethereum,"" which has forgotten about the DAO hack, and ""ethereum classic,"" which lovingly preserves it. Right, true, though isn't that sort of a tempting idea? Like if only 51 percent of shareholders approve a controversial merger, then the other 49 percent can just fork off into an alternate universe where the merger never happens? Anyway these days ethereum classic is valuable enough that the hackers' take is worth about $67.4 million. Brokers. I don't know where high-pressure Long Island retail brokerage firms get their lists of prospects to cold call, but whoever gave Joseph Stone Capital its list had a good sense of humor. Oops! It is perhaps not surprising that Joseph Stone had trouble with its cold-calling list, when you consider its list of brokers: ""71 percent of the firms’ 59 brokers had FINRA flags on their records, according to the Reuters analysis."" That story is from a Reuters report on brokerage firms who employ lots of brokers with ""a history of regulatory run-ins, legal disputes or personal financial difficulties"" that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority requires them to report. Of course Finra is a self-regulatory organization made up of industry representatives, and it is pleasing to learn that Florida-based brokerages with lots of regulatory flags are represented on its board: How to do IPOs. I used to do equity capital markets offerings (disclosure, which will become relevant in a moment: at Goldman Sachs Group Inc.), and like any sensible person I kept a checklist in a Microsoft Excel file listing everything I had to do to get an offering done, because if I forgot to, say, call compliance, or make sure that the company had enough authorized shares to do the deal, then someone would yell at me. There was a lot of creative thinking that went into structuring these deals, and a lot of marketing and client advising that went into getting them done, but also there was a checklist, and checking the number of authorized shares was on the checklist. Anyway Goldman has figured out that you can automate the checklist: It came too late for me, but for succeeding generations of rainmakers this seems like a straightforwardly good thing. As always, there is some worrying that this will lead to job losses, but I don't see it. I mean, I used Excel, which automated a much more central part of the banker's job than calling compliance. It is not like the invention of spreadsheets caused a collapse in investment banking employment; quite the reverse. And it's not like Goldman will now lay off the junior banker whose job was to keep the deal checklist. That was just one small part of her job. Now she can focus on higher-value projects, or just go home a bit earlier, which seems to be a thing in banking these days. By the way, don't you love, like, ""financial technology""? This basic sort of business-process automation is so obvious and dull that it wouldn't be news in any other industry. (""Goldman Sachs’s approach may seem obvious, but it’s cutting edge for Wall Street."") But there is so much interest in the higher-order automation of Wall Street -- in replacing the intellectual functions of stock trading and investment management and maybe even banking with artificial intelligence -- that, when a bank just automates a checklist, it is exciting and controversial. Zelle. With the recent volatility in bitcoin it is becoming increasingly clear that the true monetary foundation of the modern economy is avocado toast. It is famously a store of value, which millennials apparently use as a substitute for owning real estate, but it is also apparently a unit of exchange? Here is a story about Zelle, an instant-money-transfer service that big banks are introducing to compete with Venmo: I like eating avocado toast sometimes, but I am probably too old to fully understand its centrality to modern finance. I guess I have the same problem with ethereum though. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. Here's a front-page article about ""The Snowballing Power of the VIX, Wall Street’s Fear Index,"" which includes some prime worrying-about-insufficient-worrying quotes: The bulk of the article is a history of how CBOE Holdings Inc.'s VIX volatility index came into being and became democratized as a retail product. It's an interesting history; apparently Mark Cuban once tried to buy a VIX future from Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and was rejected, after which Goldman ""rewrote the VIX formula, expanding it to a larger universe of stock-market bets and making it possible to create a tradable futures contract,"" which then led to lots of VIX futures trading, and VIX exchange-traded funds, and the whole VIX ecosystem. It is actually a little strange. When Cuban first called Goldman in 2002, they couldn't do a VIX future, but they ""instead offered him an arcane derivative called a 'variance swap,' but Mr. Cuban wasn’t interested."" I feel like the trick is maybe don't start with ""hey this is an arcane derivative""? A variance swap, as these things go, is pretty simple: We agree that if the volatility of (say) the S&P 500 Index over the next (say) year is more than (say) 10 percent, I'll pay you the difference, and if it's less then you'll pay me. The VIX, meanwhile, is a bit of a monstrosity: It uses a formula to back out implied volatility from a bunch of S&P 500 options, and it is based on very short-term options so it constantly needs to be rolled over. If you want to bet on stock-market volatility over the next year, a variance swap just lets you do that straightforwardly; the VIX does not quite. It's fun to imagine what would have happened if, after turning Cuban down, Goldman had worked to mass-produce and democratize a volatility product based on variance swaps -- based on actual volatility -- rather than based on the VIX. People are worried about unicorns. I feel like a lot of public-company chief executive officers will be pretty jealous when they read this description of Uber Technologies Inc.'s employee stock buyback program, in which (1) employees can basically only sell their stock back to the company, not in a public market, and (2) if they sell any stock back to the company, they have to agree to vote their remaining stock as directed by CEO Travis Kalanick. ""Even if a worker sells only 10 percent of his or her stock back to the company, that worker agrees to give Mr. Kalanick the voting rights to 100 percent of his or her stock."" It seems a little weird to use corporate money to cement the CEO's personal voting control, but I guess that is more or less unicorn-standard these days. Elsewhere in Uber, top Kalanick lieutenant Emil Michael is leaving as a result of the board's investigation of the company's culture, ""signaling that the era of the boys’ club at the top is all but over at Uber."" He is not happy about it: Elsewhere in the Enchanted Forest, here's a story about Andreessen Horowitz partner Jeff Jordan's pickup basketball game. (""Stanford Business School now is a tech incubator,"" he says.) And here is an argument that to foster diversity, startups should be more professional and work less: People are worried about bond market liquidity. I mean, Treasury is, see supra.

2017-06-07T18:25:15.332Z,Bitcoin’s Valuation Is Confusing Currency Analysts,"Alexandria Arnold
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-07/bitcoin-perplexes-currency-analysts-as-valuation-debate-grows,"Bitcoin is gold for millennials. Or maybe it’s that generation’s fine wine and collectible art. Or just a bubble waiting to burst. For foreign-exchange analysts trying to use traditional methods to value the so-called cryptocurrency and its digital cousins, it may be all of the above -- but it’s not quite a currency. ""It is difficult to use standard FX valuation frameworks that are based on the fundamental drivers of the currency, like relative productivity, or terms of trade of the country, because there are no such concepts,"" said Juan Prada, a New York-based currency strategist at Barclays Capital Inc. The market capitalization of digital currencies has soared to around $100 billion since the start of the year, with bitcoin almost tripling in price to as high as $2,938.50 on Tuesday, as the frenzy around cryptocurrencies grows. Demand is swelling as more companies embrace blockchain and the similar technologies backing the various methods of exchange and some investors see it as a haven from uncertainty across the globe. While the technology is used as a means of payment -- the most basic function of money -- it may be better to view digital currencies like gold or say, a painting, than a traditional currency. Bitcoin is more volatile than even the most capricious fiat currencies and its decentralized structure makes it difficult to consider valuation. ""Both gold and bitcoin are different from usual currencies in the sense that there is not a single economic entity that uses it as a medium of exchange and unit of account,"" Prada said. That aligns with the view of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which in September 2015 said that bitcoin and other virtual currencies were officially considered commodities. By saying so, the CFTC was able to assert its authority to provide oversight of the trading of cryptocurrency futures and options in the future. Read more on alternative digital currencies Nick Bennenbroek, the head of currency strategy at Wells Fargo Securities LLC, said to the extent bitcoin could be viewed as a form of wealth or an investment, it could be considered under the class of somewhat-vague alternative assets. ""As an alternative asset, there might be some value in this electronic product because (a) you can use it for payment and (b) there might be some value from this blockchain and the ability to, in a decentralized manner, verify transactions,” Bennenbroek said . “There are other forms of assets, like people sometimes buy paintings and that’s part of their portfolio. People buy wine bottles. But some people would argue there is some intrinsic value in a painting."" Tech billionaire Mark Cuban weighed in Tuesday on the speculation, saying on Twitter that bitcoin is a bubble, helping to trigger a more than $200 intraday price swing. Cuban noted that “I’m not questioning value. I’m questioning valuation.” ""It’s definitely a medium of exchange, but the price volatility means that as a unit of account, if you’re measuring stuff in bitcoin, it’s not very helpful,"" Bennenbroek said. Buying assets as a haven can have unexpected consequences. China’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges said last week they were ending a self-imposed moratorium on withdrawals that came almost four months ago following increased scrutiny from Chinese authorities amid concerns of capital flight and money laundering. In February, the People’s Bank of China had told bitcoin venues that it would close exchanges that violated rules on foreign exchange management, money laundering and payment and settlement. ""You can’t really come up with a valuation for it and it doesn’t yield anything yet people perceive it as a safe place just in case everything else goes completely nuts,"" said Brad Bechtel, a currency strategist at Jefferies LLC."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-13/what-a-murder-in-arkansas-means-for-your-digital-privacy,"Last week, Apple unveiled its HomePod smart speaker, touting impressive sound quality and integration with Apple's Siri. The device joins offerings from Amazon and Google that promise to make our lives ever convenient—and brings us one step closer to a future where everything we do leaves behind a digital trace.  My sister has an Amazon Echo, and with its snarky jokes and talent for memorizing your favorite music, it's undoubtedly cool. But as I was reporting on the implications of the internet of things for the latest episode of our Decrypted podcast (click here to subscribe on Apple Podcasts), all of these little interactions with the virtual assistant began to carry a different weight.  Here's some of the stuff we bring up in the show:  By now, I'm used to the idea of the NSA snooping to fight terrorism…and whatever else they do. But what if our IoT data can be used against us for more routine criminal and civil cases? With 25 million people expected to buy a voice-first device this year, according to VoiceLabs, it could affect a lot of people. And it's started already. Our episode begins with a murder that made some headlines a couple months ago. Investigators seized an Echo they found at the home of James Bates, who's currently being tried for the murder of Victor Collins, 47, in Bentonville, Arkansas. Amazon initially refused to hand over data from the device, but the defendant then gave law enforcement permission to access the records. That ended the brief standoff. The prosecution hasn't presented its case yet, so we don't know what (if anything) they found in those archives.   And sure, I'm not a murder suspect, and chances are, you aren't either. But I also spoke to Kristina Bergman, CEO of Integris Software, a startup that helps tech firms comply with privacy regulations. She said that she's confident that these device makers wouldn't use the data for sinister purposes, but what if a hacker's able to break through the firewalls and use your speaker (or smart TV or internet-connected bed) to spy on you?  It all points to a future in which we'll be documented and tracked at all times.

2017-06-12T15:45:07.439Z,Gold Is Bound to Disappoint the Bulls -- Again,"Shelley Goldberg
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-12/gold-is-bound-to-disappoint-the-bulls-again,"Gold has been trending higher, and is again flirting with $1,300 per ounce. For traders, the question is whether to build their positions from here in anticipation of further gains, or is this just another teaser that presages yet another turn lower for the precious metal?  The fundamentals might suggest the former, by traders would be well advised to expect the latter. After breaking through a six-year downtrend line, gold rose last week to its highest level since Nov. 4, and is up an impressive 10.5 percent this year. There are a number of reasons why gold is in demand. For one, it's been known as an inflation hedge. And while there’s no real inflation to speak of at the moment, it’s more about expectations as evidenced by money flowing into U.S. Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities and other inflation-linked instruments. Secondly, gold, like all global commodities traded in U.S. dollars, is negatively correlated to the greenback, which has been losing value since February due to mounting doubts that President Donald Trump will succeed at pushing his pro-growth agenda through Congress.  Third, gold is considered an alternative to fixed-income assets when interest rates are low,  which is the case in much of the developed world.  The European Central Bank charges banks 0.4 percent to hold their cash overnight. Citizens in Sweden, Switzerland and Denmark can be charged to keep their money in banks. JPMorgan said last week that the amount of negative-yields bonds globally is ticking back up again, reaching $9.8 trillion. Fourth, gold seems to be the only commodity in the complex showing any signs of strength, thus appealing to commodity traders. That also applies to volatility, which has broken the downward trend seen in other parts of the commodities markets. Fifth, the U.S. stock market is trading at or near record highs, leading more pundits to warn investors of overvalued sectors (think tech) and to predict a market crash. Unlike equities, gold doesn’t have an inherent earnings per share value play, justifying its inclusion as a haven asset. And sixth, there is plenty of global geopolitical risk to popularize haven investments, from the spreading of radical Islamic terrorism, to unpredictable North Korean, Philippine and Russian strongmen, to Brexit and the potential for other European Union members to exit, to Gulf Cooperation Council nations severing ties with Qatar and heightening tensions in the Middle East. Add to that global warming, climate risk and wars over water. Then consider the U.S., where a special counsel has been set up to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election and where hopes are fading for a economic bump from President Donald Trump's pro-growth fiscal agenda. Surely the physical demand for gold is picking up as noted by the number of new gold vaults opening in Europe. Gold backed exchange-traded funds are seeing greater inflows. Gold is attractive because of the lack of faith in sovereign currencies as seen in the rising value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.  There’s also rising demand for gold in China, the world’s largest gold market, driven by currency risk and concerns over property, share and bond markets amid a government drive to reduce leverage. So, with so many valid reasons for gold to rally further, why am I a doubter?  The most rudimentary reason is that gold is also an emotional trade and $1,300 is a round number. One need not be a superstar technical analyst. Just consider that for both psychological and systematic reasons, traders and algorithms like to sell on landmark numbers that also serve as a testing ground for a rally’s sustainability. Looking back at gold over a 10-year period, these round numbers were persistently prodded.

2017-06-05T06:36:11.982Z,Bitcoin Mania Infects Japan Stock Market's Smaller Listings,"Yuji Nakamura
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-05/bitcoin-mania-infects-japanese-stock-market-s-smaller-listings,"The speculative frenzy in bitcoin is spilling over into the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Remixpoint Co., Infoteria Corp. and Fisco Ltd., have all seen volatile swings in their share prices after announcing businesses related to digital currencies. Remixpoint, which has more than doubled since tying up with Peach Aviation Ltd. to let customers pay for tickets with bitcoin, fell as much as 9 percent in Tokyo on Tuesday. Infoteria, up more than 50 percent in the past month, is testing ways to let shareholders vote by proxy using blockchain, bitcoin’s underlying technology. Fisco, a financial information services provider, began operating a bitcoin exchange last year and is up about 25 percent since early May. Infoteria declined 3.7 percent while Fisco was down 2 percent. All of these gains coincide with bitcoin’s rally, with the value of the virtual currency doubling against the U.S. dollar since early May. That has made the stocks of the these small-cap companies an attractive way for speculators to invest in cryptocurrency markets without buying them directly. That’s because investors can make bets via their brokerage accounts instead of taking risks with bitcoin exchanges, according to Naoki Murakami, a well-known day trader in Japan. “From about a month ago when all these virtual currencies started spiking like crazy, we began seeing the so-called ‘stocks of the virtual currency bubble,”’ said Murakami, a frequent speaker at investor conferences. “Not everyone is sure they can trust bitcoin exchanges. And some don’t have accounts there. That’s why they’re using the stock market to speculate.” It’s probably not a coincidence that Japan’s stock market is being seen as a proxy for bitcoin investments. In April, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s government legalized digital currencies as a form of payment and placed rules around audits and security. That lent credibility to digital currencies, leading to some Japanese companies seeking partnerships with bitcoin startups. Remixpoint is the biggest of the bunch, with a market value of 31.3 billion yen ($283 million). Remixpoint was the second-biggest gainer in the TSE Mothers Index over the past month, helping the gauge soar to the highest level in a year. Remixpoint is trading at 514 times earnings, the highest among all Japanese technology companies worth more than 30 billion yen. Another reason why these stocks can become proxies for bitcoin is due to Japan’s relatively loose listing laws, some of which require no income and a market value of as little as $10 million before a company can go public. That’s made the Tokyo Stock Exchange home to hundreds of small companies. “It’s pure frenzy,” Murakami said."

Despite its young tech-savvy citizens raised on smartphones and apps, Indonesia has the second-highest dependency on cash in the world after India, according to the World Bank. The managing partner of Draper Associates expects users to jump to cryptocurrency. “They don’t have very good banking services. So they have an opportunity to use bitcoin and make that as their currency,” he said in a Bloomberg Television interview with Haidi Lun and Rishaad Salamat from Jakarta.  “Suddenly, we’ve got this major opportunity that’s not going to be around for those countries that already have strong infrastructure.” Draper is one of the most high-profile U.S. venture capitalists to begin turning their attention from China to Indonesia, the biggest country in Southeast Asia. Earlier this week he said he wasn’t going to make new investments in China because it was difficult to get money out amid capital controls. “I can’t justify investing any more money in a country where they’re not letting money out,” he said Thursday. “It’s like putting money into a black hole.” Draper was visiting Indonesia’s capital city for the first time Thursday to meet with ride-hailing service Go-Jek as well as startups backed by Wavemaker Partners, a Southeast Asian-focused venture capital firm. “This is a great place to be. There is going to be a lot going on here.” Draper gained fame for investments in startups that went on to become household names, such as Baidu Inc., Tesla Inc. and Skype. — With assistance by Emily Cadman, and Andy Clarke"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-06/putin-eyes-bitcoin-rival-to-spur-economic-growth-beyond-oil-gas,"Ethereum, the world’s largest cryptocurrency after bitcoin, has caught the attention of Vladimir Putin as a potential tool to help Russia diversify its economy beyond oil and gas. Putin met Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin on the sidelines of the St. Petersburg Economic Forum last week and supported his plans to build contacts with local partners to implement blockchain technology in Russia, according to a statement on Kremlin’s website. “The digital economy isn’t a separate industry, it’s essentially the foundation for creating brand new business models,” Putin said at the event, discussing means to boost growth long-term after Russia ended its worst recession in two decades. Virtual currencies could help the economy by making transactions happen more quickly and safely online. Besides being a method of exchange, Ethereum can also serve as a ledger for everything from currency contracts to property rights, speeding up business by cutting out intermediaries such as public notaries. Russia’s central bank has already deployed an Ethereum-based blockchain as a pilot project to process online payments and verify customer data with lenders including Sberbank PJSC, Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said at the St. Petersburg event. She didn’t rule out using Ethereum technologies for the development of a national virtual currency for Russia down the road. Last week, Russia’s state development bank VEB agreed to start using Ethereum for some administrative functions. Steelmaker Severstal PJSC tested Ethereum’s blockchain for secure transfer of international credit letters. “Blockchain may have the same effect on businesses that the emergence on the internet once had -- it would change business models, and eliminate intermediaries such as escrow agents and clerks,” said Vlad Martynov, an adviser for The Ethereum Foundation, a non-profit organization that backs the cryptocurrency. “If Russia implements it first, it will gain similar advantages to those the Western countries did at the start of the internet age.” For more on the Russian tech industry, check out the Decrypted podcast:  "
2017-06-05T00:00:01.001Z,These Digital Tokens Are Making Bitcoin's Huge Rally Look Tame,"Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-05/digital-coins-are-making-bitcoin-s-rip-roaring-rally-appear-tame,"Forget U.S. stocks and emerging-market assets, even ignore bitcoin. Those brave enough to invest in the Wild West of tech are the ones making a killing. While the record-breaking rally in bitcoin has captivated markets, demand for other digital coins is surging as companies raise millions in minutes, or even seconds, from investors wanting in on the next big tech startup. Last week it took 30 seconds for Mozilla co-founder Brendan Eich to issue about $35 million of basic attention token, the unit of exchange in a blockchain-based advertising platform built on top of the company’s Brave browser. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain Digital tokens tied to the blockchain platform issued this year have more than doubled in price on average since trading started, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Tech startups are increasingly selling coins that can be used on their projects instead of resorting to traditional financing methods such as venture capital.   The sector isn’t for the fainthearted. The apps and websites behind most of these tokens are still only in development stage. Most are sold for pennies on the dollar and volatility can be extreme. TaaS, a closed-end fund dedicated to blockchain markets, had the coins it sold this year double in price in five weeks, and then fall 35 percent in two days. But if you can stomach the risk, the rewards have been substantial. Coins from the 15 ICOs this year for which data is available have risen by an average of over 100 percent, while shares sold in initial public offerings in the U.S. this year have gained 13 percent on average since they started trading. “There’s been overwhelming demand for coins,” said Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. “Sure, a lot of it is based on speculation and traders looking to make a quick gain, but there’s also a fundamental driver, which is the anticipation that the digital-currency market is maturing.” Read more on how digital coins are letting startups bypass venture capital Forty-four coins have been issued this year, according to blockchain research website Smith & Crown. Not all trade immediately after the auctions since some have vesting periods. The tokens with the biggest gain, a 500 percent jump since it started trading on March 30, was issued by Edgeless, which is building a decentralized gambling platform. That sale wasn’t open to U.S.-based investors since the company isn’t licensed to operate in the U.S. Prediction market platform Gnosis sold the highest valued tokens this year. The GNO token started trading at $52 on May 1 and has more than quadrupled. Even with growing acceptance of blockchain from companies ranging from Toyota Motor Corp. to JPMorgan Chase & Co., some advocates of the technology say they’re cautious of the digital tokens because of the exuberance sweeping through the cryptocurrency world. “It seems like a fad, and as a professional investor, it’s not what we do,” said David Dunn, president of Kingsbridge Wealth Management, who first bought bitcoin in 2014 and has invested in blockchain-related companies. “I’d rather invest in the companies using the technology themselves. The speculators might end up being right, and this becomes a solid investment because of the power of the technology, but we’re not at that stage.” Token sales like the one for Gnosis, which catapulted the company’s market capitalization to over $300 million without it even having a product, or Eich’s BAT coin, which was over in seconds, have raised some eyebrows. Still, the token market will probably continue to grow at least in the near future, said Nick Tomaino, principal at San Francisco-based venture-capital firm Runa Capital, who also runs The Control blog, which tracks digital currencies. More than $100 million of coins has been raised this year, surpassing total sales last year, while total issuance is expected to jump to about $600 million, according to Tomaino. “There’s a lot of hype, and a lot of money being raised because it’s so easy for anyone to create these coins without having to deal with any third parties, and it’s so easy for people to buy them,” Tomaino said. “It can’t be stopped.”"
2017-06-08T17:36:19.198Z,These Companies Stand to Gain the Most From the Cryptocurrency Rush,"Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-08/these-companies-stand-to-gain-the-most-amid-digital-coin-rush,"Mining references generally evoke images of picks and shovels. For advocates of bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies surging in value, the gold may be in the shares of the companies that produce the computer processors and chips used to create the digital currencies in the process that’s become known as mining. Digital coins can only be created by using computers to solve complex mathematical problems. The difficulty increases as more of the problems get solved, prompting the miners to require even more powerful hardware. With digital coin prices soaring, demand for the components is surging as miners are able to recoup their initial investment quicker. A complete mining rig, which is made up of graphics cards, a processor, power supply, memory, cabling and a fan, costs between $2,400 to $3,800 on Amazon.com. The Antminer S9, which is estimated to mine 0.29 bitcoin per month, and retails for $2,795, which means you can break even in about four months with bitcoin at $2,700, without taking into account electricity costs. Miners typically buy complete rigs or build them themselves. The following are some of the companies that make the parts. The Santa Clara, California-based company manufactures graphic processing units used by gamers and increasingly, by digital-currency miners. GPUs listed in Nvidia’s website can cost as much as $1,200. The rig-mining market can grow to about $1.3 billion, and with GPUs making up approximately 2/3 of coin mining costs, the demand for GPUs can increase to $875 million, according to a RBC Capital Markets report on June 6. If Nvidia gets half of that, it represents a 10 percent increase on its GPU sales, RBC analyst Mitch Steves said in an interview. The company currently has about 75 percent of the GPU market, according to a Jon Peddie Research report. The complexity of mining bitcoin has increased to the point that GPUs aren’t powerful enough, and miners are mostly using application-specific integrated circuits, or ASICs, which Nvidia and competitor Advanced Micro Devices don’t make. Tech news website Digitimes reported Nvidia and AMD are planning to release GPUs specifically designed to mine bitcoin. Shares of Nvidia have climbed 45 percent this year, and have more then tripled in the past year. AMD, as the company is known, also makes graphics cards used for mining ethereum and other coins. The Sunyvale, California-based company’s shares have rallied the most in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index in the past week, in part thanks to a PCWorld article that said it’s almost “impossible” to get AMD’s Radeon graphics cards after a surge in demand from ethereum miners.  The company also builds the processors typically used to build mining rigs, and its Chief Technology Officer Mark Papermaster said at a Bank of America Merrill Lynch conference its product compete with bigger rival Intel Corp. The shares are up 27 percent in the past month, and have almost tripled over 12 months. Digital currency mining has the potential to boost demand for Intel’s processors, said Kevin Cassidy, an analyst at Stifel Nicolaus. While AMD CPUs are popular among miners, Intel is the traditional leader in the sector and is taking steps to counter its fledgling rival. The company’s shares have lagged rivals, with a gain of 17 percent in the past year. Boise, Idaho-based Micron is the largest U.S. maker of memory chips, one of the components of a mining rig, so it also stands to benefit, Cassidy said. Micron shares have surged almost 50 percent this year, and have more then doubled in the past 12 months. — With assistance by Sophie Caronello"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-06/billionaire-draper-shuns-china-investments-amid-capital-controls,"Billionaire investor Tim Draper, an early backer of Baidu Inc., has stopped investing in China-based companies because getting money out of the country has become too difficult. China restricts the amount of money that can leave its borders to limit the pressure on the yuan and recently tightened capital controls. The moves have already scuttled some takeover deals. “I’m not investing in China. I’ve stopped, I’ve closed the door,” the managing partner of Draper Associates said in an interview in Sydney on Tuesday. “Why would I invest in a country where they don’t let money leave? I’m a fiduciary, I have to take care of my investors.” Draper gained fame for investments in startups that went on to become household names, including Tesla Inc., Hotmail and Skype. He also backed blood-testing startup Theranos Inc. and has defended founder Elizabeth Holmes even as questions have been raised about the accuracy of the company’s technology. While China may be off his agenda, Draper still has an appetite for investments in the developing world. A passionate supporter of bitcoin and the underlying blockchain technology, he expects the take-up of new digital forms of payment will be faster, in the same way that many Chinese skipped fixed telephone lines and went straight to mobile. “I think the same thing is going to happen in place like Africa, Indonesia, South America -- they are going to just jump straight to bitcoin,’’ Draper said. He recently invested in Africa’s BitPesa, which aims to make doing business across the continent and different currencies easier. He lauds the attitude to bitcoin in Japan, where the government has decided to embrace the currency and formally regulate it. Another of his recent investments is U.S based Tezos, where Draper participated in a so-called initial coin offering of digital tokens.  “Geographic borders have fallen,” Draper said, arguing good ideas will spread regardless of where they are originated. “I am agnostic as to where the company comes from as long as it is a place I can invest in and get my money out.”"
2017-06-09T13:09:39.274Z,Hedge-Fund Growth and Tax Arbitrage,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-09/hedge-fund-growth-and-tax-arbitrage,"Skin in the game. Everyone knows the stereotypical way that hedge funds work: You start a little hedge fund, raise a little money, and go invest it in your best ideas. Those ideas do well and you have good returns. You then market your fund based on those returns, and raise a lot more money. Now you have a big hedge fund, and you invest it in your best ideas, but also your second- and third-best ideas, because there is no room in the best ideas for all the money. Then you have mediocre returns. This is fine for you, because you are getting paid management fees on all the money in your hedge fund, and getting paid 2 percent on billions of dollars is a perfectly fine way to make a living. It is less good for your investors, though: They wanted the good returns you used to get on the small amount of money, not the mediocre returns you now get on their big pile of money. But of course you are also an investor. So there is a trade-off here: As a hedge-fund manager, you want to grow as much as possible, even by sacrificing performance, because that's how you get fees. As an investor in your own fund, though, you don't want to grow beyond your best ideas, the ones that actually make money. One might imagine a sort of inflection point, where managers who are mostly managers want to focus on growth, and managers who are also large investors in their own funds want to focus on returns. Here is a delightful paper by Arpit Gupta of NYU Stern and Kunal Sachdeva of Columbia Business School confirming that intuition: The mechanism is exactly what you'd expect: They use a cutoff of 20 percent insider ownership, which seems to be about the average. Funds with less than 20 percent insider ownership tend to grow after having high excess returns, and then have worse returns; funds with more than 20 percent insider ownership tend to stay the same size, and continue to outperform. ""Our findings have implications for optimal portfolio allocations of institutional investors,"" they say, but do they? The most important lesson is probably that you should invest with a hedge-fund manager who doesn't want your money, but that is hard to do. Dividend arbitrage. I just can't get that worked up about dividend arbitrage, which seems like a straightforward and not particularly exciting tax trade. You take shares with taxable dividends, park them with a non-taxable holder on the dividend day, avoid the tax and split the profits. Meh. It's just a bit crude; as an aesthetic matter I like my tax trades to be subtler and more complicated. And as a policy matter most people seem to dislike dividend arbitrage: Any tax trade that crude probably has no economic substance and should be shut down. So now it has been shut down in a lot of places, but for a long time it could be done legally in Germany, and banks did a lot of dividend-arbitrage trades there and saved billions of euros in taxes. But lots of other people always seem to be getting worked up about German dividend arbitrage, and in that vein I give you ""The Great Tax Robbery,"" a deep dive from Die Zeit about ""how bankers, consultants, and lawyers have been plundering the German state for decades"" using dividend arbitrage trades. (There is also a series of data visualizations.) It is full of the sort of color you expect to see in big stories about financial scandals, though even this color feels somehow a bit wan. Apparently a lot of dividend arbitrage trades -- called ""cum-ex"" trades, because someone has the shares cum dividends and someone else has them ex-dividends -- were concocted at the Cinnamon Club, a fancy Indian restaurant in London:  Those nicknames ... they are fine? ""What should we call the guy who wears shorts?"" ""The Man in Short Pants."" ""Great. What about the crazy guy?"" ""Let's call him the Crazy Guy."" ""Great, glad we've figured this all out, I'm off for a cruise on my yacht, Large Boat Purchased With The Proceeds of Tax Arbitrage."" With an imagination like that, you too could structure dividend arbitrage trades. Andrew Left.  Here is a fun profile of Andrew Left, the activist short seller behind Citron Research, that sometimes seems to confuse ""the world of finance"" with ""Twitter"": But that's fine, an important theme of modern life is the convergence of reality and Twitter. Left, for instance, uses his skill at Twitter to make real money; he shorts stocks, then tweets mean things about them, then they go down, even if his tweets have some errors: I mean, that can get you elected president these days.  The thesis of the profile is that Left is sort of operating as a journalist, though, as he says, ""The difference between this and journalism is you can make millions of dollars."" In the olden days, short sellers just shorted stock and stayed quiet. Then they started shorting stock and working with journalists to expose frauds at their targets. Now, ""short-sellers of Left’s generation are following this example but cutting out the middleman,"" shorting stock and taking to Twitter to expose frauds in their own names. But ""cutting out the middleman"" isn't quite right either; Left is also taking over that role: Why call a reporter to pitch a story that is helpful to your short thesis, when you can call Andrew Left? He has a lot more to gain from that pitch. Aramco and indexing. When I am trying to be contrarian, I sometimes like to say that it's weird that Uber Technologies Inc. isn't in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. Obviously this is absurd: The S&P is only open to companies that are listed on U.S. public stock exchanges, and Uber is not public. (Also the S&P requires GAAP profitability, but that is a minor quibble compared to the public listing thing.) But it is a very large-cap U.S. company, and many of its shares are owned by large U.S. mutual funds, and they trade in the secondary market. If you are an institutional asset manager and your mandate is to invest in large U.S. companies, then Uber could quite plausibly be on your list of potential investments. And if you are an institutional asset manager with a passive mandate to invest in all the large U.S. companies, then it might seem a little arbitrary to exclude Uber. It is a large U.S. company that you can invest in; why exclude it just because it's not in the S&P, or listed on an exchange, or whatever? I mean there are plenty of reasons not to invest in Uber, but by hypothesis you are not looking for reasons. You are just investing in ""the market."" But even so, you need to give some thought to exactly what ""the market"" is. I am mostly just kidding about all of that, but meanwhile in London: ""Concern has grown that a UK listing would mean the state oil company becoming a member of the FTSE 100 index, making an arm of the Saudi state an automatic holding for millions of pension funds,"" but that concern seems to have been averted. But imagine if Saudi Arabian Oil Co. does go public in the U.K. at some of the numbers that have been batted around, like a $2 trillion valuation and a 5 percent ($100 billion) free float. The combined market capitalization of the FTSE 100 is about 2 trillion pounds. If you are an investor who wants passive exposure to large-cap U.K.-listed companies -- if you just want to own ""the market"" -- it has to feel a little weird to exclude a U.K.-listed company that is as big as the rest of the market combined.  Oh of course there are good reasons to keep Aramco out of the FTSE! (Such as the FTSE requirement that index companies have at least 25 percent free float.) But those reasons are choices; they are distinct from the classic passive-investor desire to avoid complexity and underperformance by just owning the whole market. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. The kids these days, they go to the business schools, and they say ""blockchain!"", and the business schools say ""blockchain?"", and the kids say ""blockchain!"", and the business schools say ""block ... chain?"", and this happens: ""Fintech"" doesn't really seem like a coherent body of knowledge any more than, like, ""Cool Finance Stuff"" would be, but I guess you have to follow the trends. I think if I were a business school professor I would teach a course called Fintech 101, and people would show up on the first day and I'd be like ""it's called Microsoft Excel, ever hear of it?"" Actually no I am kidding, if I were a business school professor I would teach a course called ""Cool Finance Stuff."" There'd probably still be a blockchain unit, I'm sorry. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. Here are some people worrying about why volatility is so low and what will happen to it. The consensus in conversations like this always seems to be that low volatility now means that there will be high volatility later. ""Whenever something is the new norm, I know it is about to change,"" says Chris Concannon of CBOE Holdings Inc. That is generally a safe thing to think about markets: This time is never different; human folly recurs endlessly. But it is often more interesting to think about why today's low volatility really might be a new normal, an evolution in financial markets rather than just a low point in a cycle. Here is Nicholas Colas of Convergex: Maybe that is wrong and naive, but in some sense shouldn't it be right? We tend to expect progress in most technological and scientific domains: Over time, people are supposed to learn stuff and improve their performance. Cars really do get safer over time. Shouldn't markets get more efficient? People are worried about unicorns. The main unicorn worry these days always seems to be about Uber Technologies Inc. Today it's about how Uber, a giant mature multinational company, still seems to operate on the rather casual standards of the rest of the Enchanted Forest: When Snap Inc. issued nonvoting stock in its initial public offering so that its charismatic founders could retain control even while raising money from the public, I assumed that would set a precedent for other big unicorns to limit shareholder control, a precedent that would only be reversed when something went wrong: Eventually some unicorn with a charismatic founder will go public with terrible shareholder rights, and get in trouble, and the shareholders will have no recourse, and they will learn a lesson and refuse to let future unicorns get away with nonvoting stock. But I guess there are other things that might cause investors to push back. If Uber went public tomorrow, would you buy nonvoting stock that would let Travis Kalanick keep unilateral control forever? People are worried about bond market liquidity. My Bloomberg Gadfly colleague Lisa Abramowicz, who has been worrying about bond market liquidity for years, wonders what took the Trump administration so long: ""When a man is tired of thinking about bond market liquidity, he is tired of life,"" Johnson almost said, but this seems right: The Volcker Rule, for instance, is probably not a switch that can be turned on and off at will: Once you fire all your proprietary risk-takers, it's not so easy to start taking proprietary risk again just because the regulators let you. And the old-fashioned model in which banks step in to take on a lot of risk whenever the rest of the market panics, which was not all that true to begin with, will be hard to revive no matter how favorable the regulatory environment is. Equity markets moved pretty far away from that model long before the Volcker Rule. Elsewhere, here is Darrell Duffie of Stanford University arguing ""that one particular regulation, the leverage-ratio rule, has inefficiently distorted dealer incentives for market making and that its financial-stability benefits could be achieved more effectively with risk-weighted capital requirements.""

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-05/pantera-capital-adds-blockchain-coins-to-venture-capital-fund,"Dan Morehead’s Pantera Capital Management, which calls itself the first U.S. bitcoin investment firm, is buying other digital coins. Pantera Vice President Paul Veradittakit said the San Francisco-based firm is “opportunistically” adding blockchain-based coins to its $25 million venture fund. Among other investments, it plans to buy tokens of 0x, a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol, when it holds its initial coin offering. “It’s a new class of fundraising where investors can get exposure to really great teams and really great products,” Veradittakit said in a June 2 interview. Pantera also manages a fund that invests exclusively in bitcoin, in which Fortress Investment Group has a stake. Veradittakit declined to say how big the bitcoin fund is, or whether Fortress is an investor in Pantera’s venture fund. Other firms with dedicated token funds are San Francisco-based venture capital firm Blockchain Capital and hedge fund Polychain Capital. There’s been a boom in token issuance this year, with sales expected to climb to about $600 million, compared with $100 million issued in 2016. Tokens have doubled their prices on average since their start of trading, according to data compiled by Bloomberg, while bitcoin is also trading near a record. Read more on how digital coins are making bitcoin’s rally appear tame Pantera’s Veradittakit isn’t concerned about the surge in prices as the market should continue to grow once a larger number of institutional investors are able to participate in the sector. “Wait until the mainstream gets wind of this and we’ll see many bigger ‘bubbles’ going forward,” Veradittakit said. “Some of these companies will fizzle out, but people will learn about investing in this ecosystem and finding where the real value. We’ll see lots of great successful companies come out of this.”"
2017-06-06T15:14:01.969Z,How Financial Vulnerability Helped to Curb Global Productivity,"Jeanna Smialek
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-06/how-financial-vulnerability-helped-to-curb-global-productivity,"Productivity has slumped the world over, and credit conditions might be at least partly to blame.  That's the first finding we outline in this week's economic research wrap, and it's an important one: economists have been scratching their heads for years about why efficiency improvements have slowed so much, and this might explain as much as a third of the pullback. We also take a look at millennial homeownership, the hollowing out of the middle class in advanced economies, and the future of digital currency at central banks. Check this column each Tuesday for a synopsis of new and interesting studies from around the world.  We can add financial conditions to the list of plausible explanations for the global productivity slowdown. New International Monetary Fund research finds that companies with a lot of leverage or a lot of debt maturing during the crisis era saw a larger total factor productivity slowdown than their counterparts on firmer financial footing.What's more, the pullback was worse in countries where credit conditions tightened more right after Lehman Brothers collapsed in September 2008. Balance-sheet vulnerable businesses cut their intangible investment, such as research and development and workforce training, which in turn slowed their efficiency improvements. On average, these trends could have accounted for about a third of the post-crisis slowdown in productivity growth, the researchers write. Financial Frictions and the Great Productivity SlowdownPublished May 31Available on the IMF website America's largest generation should be in good shape to underpin growth in homeownership: An index of home affordability for young adults is above historical averages, by Bank of America calculations.  Yet millennials still aren't buying. Down-payments and student loans may be standing in their way, and tighter credit standards could be another barrier. Also key, though, is a major shift in their habits and lifestyles. Today's young adults spend more on health care and household operations, and they're getting married later -- delaying one of the major life events that triggers homeownership. What's more, they've moved into city centers, where renting is more common. ""We don't expect these dynamics to change in the medium-term which should translate to a lower equilibrium pace for single family housing starts,"" economists Michelle Meyer and Alexander Lin write.  Is it cool to buy a home?Published  June 1Available to Bank of America clients Advanced economies have seen their middle classes hollow out in recent decades, and two theories are often floated to explain the ongoing trend. On one hand, expanded global trade and investment mean that workers are competing against labor from around the world. On the other, technological advances are pitting workers against robots. In a new report, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development says they should be taken in conjunction to explain middle-class decline. As global competition becomes fiercer, it pushes companies to find efficiencies to ensure their own survival, leading toward outsourcing and mechanization. Companies that fail to adapt see productivity fall, especially in the materials and industrials sector. ""These heterogeneous within-industry outcomes lie at the heart of worker disgruntlement with their rapidly changing world,'' according to the annual Business and Finance Outlook.OECD Business and Finance Outlook 2017Published May 30Available on the OECD website  The emergence of private digital currencies like Bitcoin has drummed up interest in a related idea: could central banks create digital currency, and if they did, would those also be based on distributed ledger technology? A new Bank of England blog post tackles the second question. With Bitcoin's distributed ledger technology, there's no reliance on one central party to maintain records: instead, data is shared, replicated and synchronized. In the case of a central bank-issued currency, ""the presence of at least one trusted central party (the central bank) means that many of Bitcoin’s design features would be neither necessary nor desirable,"" Simon Scorer writes. There are also cybersecurity issues with the practice, though it might offer resilience benefits: having data distributed means that there's no single point of failure if something goes awry.The post is a good primer on an issue that's sure to remain on central bankers' minds.

2017-06-02T13:27:29.446Z,Cat Funds and Cooking IPOs,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-02/cat-funds-and-cooking-ipos,"Cat beta. For science, Bloomberg's Dani Burger built an index of companies with ""cat"" in their names, found that it was up 849,751 percent in a backtest, and shopped the idea to various quants, who gamely made fun of it. Cliff Asness: ""Seems like the tail risks here might be a little high,"" concludes Burger, a kicker that also backtested extremely well. One real lesson here is that a lot of factor outperformance comes from equal-weighting of teeny stocks. The cat index got most of its outperformance from ""the basically untradeable Catskill Litigation Trust, which gained 79,000 percent this year (to trade at one penny)."" We talked recently about a paper finding that most efficient-market-hypothesis anomalies seem not to replicate: Many anomalies come from equal-weighting microcap stocks, which allow researchers to find anomalies in data but do not allow actual investors to find actual profits in actual stock trading. Another lesson is the one about economic intuition. Here's an objection from Goldman Sachs Asset Management: A lot of people -- including Asness -- tell Burger the same thing, and it is absolutely canonical and sensible. But I wonder if it will seem quaint to the next investing generation, one more reliant on artificial intelligence and machine learning than on economic intuition. There's a great Wired story about AlphaGo, the AI machine that programmers taught to play Go, and how it came up with its counterintuitive but decisive move 37 in its match against Go champion Lee Sedol: AlphaGo's programmers taught it Go intuition, but then it developed its own Go intuition that surpassed their own, and it went and found moves for which there was no (human) Go intuition -- and it won. ""We're artificial intelligence programmers first and Go experts second,"" AlphaGo's programmers might as well have said. The scientific process, not the subject-matter expertise, dominated. The first stage in investing was that people had economic intuitions and acted on them: ""This company seems good, so I'll buy it."" Later still, they had economic intuitions, and programmed computers to act on them: ""Companies with low valuations are cheap, so I'll have a computer look for them and buy them."" The next phase is for the computers to have the intuitions, and act on them, in ways that the humans can understand: ""The computer has found a parakeet factor that predicts outperformance, and I can sort of understand the neoclassical and behavioral foundations for the parakeet factor, so I'm letting the computer run with it."" But one can imagine a final phase in which the computers have intuitions that are not explicable in human-intuitive ways: ""The computer is buying cat stocks. I don't get it. But the computer has a pretty good track record so whatever."" Elsewhere, Jeff Tarrant of Protégé Partners is betting on AI:  I wonder if it's named after AlphaGo's move 37. And still elsewhere: ""Bots Won’t Just Help Us Buy Stuff. They’ll Help Us Become Better Versions of Ourselves."" Blue Apron IPO. Meal-kit-delivery service and universal podcast sponsor Blue Apron Holdings, Inc., filed to go public yesterday, with net losses of about $55 million in 2016 and $52 million in the first quarter of 2017. I have a general mental model of the modern financial ecosystem in which companies basically fund their development and expansion with the limitless money available in private markets and then, once they are mature businesses, they go public to make it easier to return money to shareholders. But that model is not universally applicable, and some of the big recent initial public offerings -- Blue Apron, and Snap Inc. before it -- seem to have the more traditional purpose of actually raising money. Blue Apron, at least, seems like it could use the cash. Also like Snap, Blue Apron is going public with a class of nonvoting stock, though unlike Snap it's selling voting stock in the IPO: That's the same structure as Facebook Inc. and Alphabet Inc., both of which went public with two classes and added zero-vote stock for acquisitions later. But now that the technology exists, why wouldn't a hot technology company build it in at the time of its IPO? And why wouldn't a hot grocery company that wants to be a technology company build it in at the time of its IPO? Given the more or less complete absence of pushback to Snap's decision to go public with nonvoting stock, it would be a little strange for anyone to go public with a simple one-share-one-vote structure. I mean, there will eventually be a backlash: Shareholders will eventually be deeply disappointed in some ex-unicorn, and realize that they're powerless to change things there, and take out their frustration on the next IPOing unicorn. But until that happens, if you are a founder thinking about going public, why wouldn't you take the opportunity to keep control? Elsewhere, here is a story about the first Regulation A+ offering that will lead to a listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Well, the NYSE MKT exchange -- NYSE's small-cap exchange -- but still. It's a medical robotics company, Myomo Inc., and it sounds charming, though the overall Regulation A+ world is a little scruffy: Bitcoin swaps. Oh hey smart-contract cryptocurrency swaps: The company offering this -- a Swiss startup called ShapeShift -- will initially be the counterparty to all trades, and will hedge by buying the underlying bitcoins or whatever. (Also it will charge 1 percent per month and 2.4 percent to close out.) Financial derivatives are an obvious early use case for smart contracts: They don't require any action in the real world, just exchanges of cash flows (or cryptocurrency flows), so the whole thing can just happen on the blockchain. On the other hand they are not exactly the most inspiring or world-changing use case. If the upshot of blockchain-based smart contracting platforms is that you can ... buy bitcoins synthetically? ... then that's not that impressive. You could just buy bitcoins directly, on their own blockchain. Elsewhere here is Izabella Kaminska on blockchain Ponzi schemes and initial coin offerings. SALT. Hamilton Nolan went to the Skybridge Alternatives Conference for some reason, and found it bad, though not as bad as you might have expected him to? The best thing about SALT, it seems to me, is that you don't have to go to SALT, so I don't. But Nolan did, and while the title of his article at Deadspin is ""Hell Is Empty And All the Hedge Fund Managers Are At The Bellagio,"" he seems to have been at least a little bit seduced. For instance, he seems oddly charmed by SALT impresario Anthony Scaramucci, whom he calls ""the schmooziest man in the hedge fund world,"" but who he also thinks is sincere in his concern about wealth inequality. Also he came back from SALT with some investment recommendations for Deadspin readers: And he does.  God's work. If you work at an investment bank, and your parents are a little disappointed in you, consider printing out this article for them: Maybe it's best if they stop there, though; the rest of it gets a little weird: On the other hand: ""Dirty, Dingy Hospitals: Doctors Blame Debt-Fueled Takeovers."" I guess it takes all kinds; some bankers make health care better, others make it worse. Goldman is cool now. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein is on Twitter now, moved to tweet by Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement on climate change. (Like many CEOs, he's against the withdrawal.) Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman, and as of 8 a.m. this morning I have more Twitter followers than Blankfein, so please do not follow him as I would like to keep it that way. In other news about Goldman and my strange internet life, yesterday I suggested that the logo for Goldman's Marcus consumer lending business ""really should be a sepia-toned portrait of its 19th-century namesake, but with a nose ring. And maybe some equations scrawled on him."" And so two readers sent me illustrations of that. Here's one from Rob Terrin on Twitter: People are worried that people aren't worried enough. ""The CBOE Volatility Index posted its second-lowest monthly average ever in May, according to WSJ Market Data Group, finishing the month with a 10.86 average,"" despite all the warnings about complacency at the beginning of the month and a brief spike in the VIX in the middle. Markets can remain complacent longer than you can remain interested in this topic, is perhaps the lesson here. People are worried about bond market liquidity. Nah, actually, people are very excited about the bond indexing business: The latest is Intercontinental Exchange Inc. buying Bank of America Corp.'s bond index business, days after London Stock Exchange Group Plc bought Citigroup Inc.'s bond index business. I suppose if you are worried about bond market liquidity you might find it interesting that banks are getting out of the bond indexing business and exchanges are getting into it; perhaps that is a sign of the future of the broader bond trading business.

         & Lulu Yilun Chen
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-01/china-s-largest-bitcoin-exchanges-to-again-allow-withdrawals,"China’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges are ending a self-imposed moratorium on withdrawals, helping the cryptocurrency to resume its record-breaking rally. The exchanges suspended withdrawals almost four months ago following increased scrutiny from Chinese authorities amid concerns of capital flight and money laundering. In February, the People’s Bank of China told bitcoin venues that it would close exchanges that violate rules on foreign exchange management, money laundering and payment and settlement. Bitcoin rose as much as 8.5 percent to $2479.34 Thursday, the biggest intraday advance since May 25, when it reached a record high of $2,798.98. The cryptocurrency has more than doubled since March amid optimism about wider acceptance among companies and consumers, regulatory approval in Japan and rising demand in Asia. BTC China is testing the functionality of withdrawals, Chief Executive Officer Bobby Lee said in a telephone interview Thursday. A spokeswoman for OKCoin confirmed that it’s also testing withdrawals. Both exchanges intend to place caps on withdrawal amounts. Huobi has resumed coin withdrawals, a spokeswoman said in a text message, with a limit of 50 coins per transaction and 50 transactions per day. The exchange also placed limited on litecoin and ethereum withdrawals."
2017-05-31T15:32:54.078Z,Bitcoin Exuberance Is Even More Dramatic in Its Lone Investment Trust,"Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/bitcoin-exuberance-even-more-dramatic-in-lone-investment-trust,"If you need evidence that bitcoin mania is getting extreme, look at the lone investment vehicle available to institutional investors. Grayscale Investments’ Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trades over-the-counter in the U.S. and offers direct exposure to bitcoin, surged 85 percent last week, compared with the digital currency’s 17 percent increase. Those gains brought the fund known by its ticker, GBTC, to trade at more than twice its net asset value, the highest premium ever. That has some long-term advocates of the cryptocurrency pausing. “We took some profits on GBTC for the first time since 2015 because its premium to bitcoin became too extreme,” said Cathie Wood, the New York-based chief investment officer at ARK Investment Management, which oversees the first exchange-traded fund with exposure to the virtual currency. “There’s a scarcity value in GBTC because for us and for other investors, to buy an instrument, it has to be a financial security. The only way we can own bitcoin is through GBTC.” GBTC’s premium surged as investors who can’t buy digital currencies flooded the fund as bitcoin climbed to new records. Blockchain assets are surging following multiple factors including, Japan saying it will recognize bitcoin as a legal payment method, Fidelity’s Abigail Johnson endorsing its use, and as evidence shows there’s growing adoption by companies and efforts to scale the technology. This all took place as industry leaders and enthusiasts joined in at least three highly attended conferences in New York last week. Some of the barriers blocking institutional investors’ access are that Individual Retirement Accounts only accept financial assets, that most funds have internal liquidity or risk limits which bitcoin and other digital currencies may not meet, or that internal compliance or audits don’t approve of the assets. Also, some investors don’t want to go through what they perceive as risk and hassle of dealing with bitcoin wallets and exchanges. Read more about the skepticism surrounding the surge in the price of bitcoin Grayscale’s trust, which has just under $400 million in total assets, is one of the few alternatives institutional investors have. Channel Islands-based Global Advisors Jersey Ltd. provides a fund with indirect exposure to bitcoin and two exchange-traded notes that invest in the digital currency, which are listed in Sweden. Global Advisors Chief Executive Officer Daniel Masters says the interest is stronger in the exchange-traded products and his fund has seen rising inflows from wealthy individuals and family offices. Attempts to list exchange traded funds that track bitcoin were initially rejected by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on the grounds that the bitcoin market isn’t regulated, making it subject to “fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,” but granted a request to review the decision. ARK’s Wood said that while a bitcoin ETF might make sense in the future, the bitcoin market doesn’t have the volume or liquidity to withstand the demand that would come from an ETF, so GBTC might be the best way to go for U.S. investor in the near future. “It’s going to be liquid enough, but we’re still in the very early stages,” Wood said. “A lot of people are worried that there’s a bubble, but I think this is just the beginning.” — With assistance by Justina Lee"
2017-06-06T17:16:39.606Z,A Vast Blockchain Experiment Could Change Russia,"Leonid Bershidsky
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-06/ethereum-could-change-russian-banking-and-government,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and his economic team have long been under the impression that, to wean the country off its oil dependence, they needed a major leap in some specific area of technology that wasn't yet dominated by Western, Chinese or Japanese tech giants. Their latest hopes are being pegged to the Ethereum blockchain platform.QuickTake Vladimir Putin At last week's St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Putin talked to Vitalik Buterin, the founder of Ethereum. Buterin's family emigrated from Russia to Canada when he was six. There, the math whiz got interested in Bitcoin while still in his teens. A $100,000 fellowship from Peter Thiel's foundation launched him on the Ethereum project.  Though Buterin's platform does host the ether currency, which has risen in value to more than $260 from $8 so far this year, it's far more ambitious than that. Buterin thinks of his project as the safe medium for all sorts of transactions that can be validated through a distributed system, the way Bitcoin transactions are. This includes bets, option deals, insurance contracts, the government registration of property rights and copyright -- pretty much any kind of deal that requires validation or that can be automatically executed when certain conditions become right. Ethereum provides a universal blockchain upon which various projects can be built.  Russia has brilliant engineering brains, and it could try to lure back talented Russians like Buterin and those who work in Silicon Valley. But it's not easy to find the ""blue ocean"" areas not infested with international sharks like Apple, Google and Alibaba. In the past decade, technological bets placed by Russian leaders have suffered from being overly audacious or too far behind the competition. In 2007, Putin thought it would be nanotechnology. In typical style, he set up a giant state company to develop the tech and put former Kremlin chief of staff Anatoly Chubais, reputed to be one of the country's best managers, at its helm. It didn't work. Rosnano, as the company was called, struggled to find relevant projects to invest in, and the ones in which it did invest haven't delivered the kind of breakthrough that could have propelled the Russian economy forward. Last year, Rosnano posted a steep revenue drop and a loss of 17.4 billion rubles ($307 million).  During Dmitri Medvedev's interim presidency, the Kremlin attempted a different tack, diving in with the sharks. It made a feeble attempt to create a Silicon Valley clone near Moscow in partnership with global tech companies and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Oligarchs and state companies were forced to invest. Though the Skolkovo project still exists, and so do its ambitious plans, but it hasn't delivered, either, because it attracted more attention from Russian law enforcement than from actual innovators and private investors.  The search for a promising moonshot resumed when Putin became president again. Last year, he hit on Elon Musk's hyperloop idea as something Russia could put into practice. Russia's expanse, after all, calls for a hyperloop-style solution. At the 2016 St. Petersburg Economic Forum, Putin promised support to a company called Hyperloop One, and indeed, Kremlin-linked investors soon arrived for the start-up. Then the project ran into trouble amid bitter recriminations between co-founder Shervin Pishevar and former chief technology officer Brogan BamBrogan. The company still exists and proposes projects in a number of countries -- it opened a test track in Nevada earlier this year -- but Russia doesn't appear to be a priority for the U.S. firm despite the Russian investment. Lately, Ethereum has become the arena for a boom in capital-raising through the sale of digital tokens which can be used within a certain application, such as the Gnosis prediction market, which raised $12 million in 15 minutes in that way. Though large global companies got there first -- the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance, formed to promote the technology in various business environments, includes UBS, JP Morgan, Microsoft, Intel and other giants -- Russia has a chance to be ahead of others. Like other central banks, the Russian one is testing blockchain technology: Last year, a consortium of large Russian banks it formed for the purpose processed the first transactions through the Etherium platform. With Putin's support, which means everything in today's Russia, the central bank, run by Putin favorite Elvira Nabiullina, can more aggressively move the country's financial sector to the blockchain.  Buterin has also offered his platform to Russia's vast government sector, stressing its anti-corruption potential: The system is inherently transparent. I'm not sure the Putin elite is excited about this aspect of the blockchain, but Putin himself might be interested in the potential for greater control that it creates. The brief meeting between Putin and Buterin last week might open exciting prospects for the latter. His vast country of birth is the most impressive field for controlled experiments any techie could dream of; in Putin's system, decisions can be made fast, and mistakes can be forgiven in the name of Russia's great leap forward.  I doubt Putin will ever have the courage to give 23-year-old Buterin a free hand to redesign Russia's financial system or massive bureaucracy. Powerful interests will lobby against it, too. But, stuck in the 20th century both politically and economically, Russia does need a leap to remain relevant. A giant blockchain experiment might be another wrong turn -- but, more likely, it would give the country a powerful modernizing impulse.  This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

2017-05-31T06:00:07.018Z,"Bitcoin, Stocks and the Fear of Missing Out","Ben Carlson
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-31/bitcoin-stocks-and-the-fear-of-missing-out,"Bitcoin has been on an unbelievable run. The cryptocurrency is up around 124 percent for 2017. And that’s after it gained 125 percent in 2016. In May alone, it’s up more than 60 percent. It’s hard to know what the long-term impact or performance will be, but one thing’s for sure -- investors are swept up in cryptocurrency mania. One simple theory for Bitcoin’s vertiginous rise in recent weeks is that it’s turning into something of a self-fulfilling prophecy. Momentum begets momentum and buying begets buying when gains begin to come hard and fast. Consider that Bitcoin’s price is up, on average, four out of every five days in May. It’s up seven out of every 10 days in 2017. When you combine these types of batting averages with large gains, it’s sure to grab people’s attention and attract performance chasers and speculators who want to get in on the action. Seeing gains on top of gains increases investor confidence that those gains will last indefinitely. Confidence grows with each new high. Contrast these results with the stock market. Since 1926, if you were to take the daily performance of the S&P 500 and break things down into gains and losses, the numbers show that it’s basically a coin flip between up and down days, with 54 percent of all days showing positive performance and 46 percent with negative returns. Even during the huge bull market since early 2009, the daily returns have followed a similar pattern: The positive days slightly outweigh the negative days, but it’s close enough that any time stocks begin to fall investors worry that the end is near for this lengthy rally. The reason these types of statistics matter is that human nature makes it difficult for people to process losses in the same way they deal with gains. Research from the behavioral psychologist Daniel Kahneman shows that we regret losses twice as much as gains make us feel good. This bias is called loss aversion. So the probability of seeing gains or losses can have a huge impact on our actions as investors. Since the daily performance in the stock market is more or less a 50-50 proposition, loss aversion means that checking the value of your investments on a daily basis will make you feel terrible every single day. All those warm feelings you get from the winning days in the markets will be completely wiped out by the double dose of pain of the down days. The simple solution to deal with this issue for stock market investors is to avoid evaluating your portfolio on a regular basis. The more you look, the more likely it is that you’ll see losses since stocks don’t hit new highs every single day. While stocks alternate gains and losses, on average, if you lengthen your time horizon, the probabilities for a positive return are much higher. Using the same data for the S&P 500 going back to 1926, all one-year periods showed gains roughly three out of every four years. Extend the time horizon to 10 years, and it was close to 95 percent of all periods with gains. Less frequent portfolio evaluations make it more likely that you’ll see gains, and, in effect, reduce the pain experienced through loss aversion. Everyone seems to have an opinion about how high the price of Bitcoin can go or how quickly it will fall back down to Earth. Yet it’s impossible to forecast the emotions of other investors, and at a certain point that’s all that ends up driving these types of price moves. But my guess would be that the current Bitcoin rally will start its downfall once the daily returns are more evenly balanced out between up and down days. It may be obvious to state that an increase in volatility will cause investors to bail, but it’s helpful to understand the reasons behind this type of price action. Once loss aversion begins to be felt again in the price of Bitcoin, that will likely spell the end of its relentless rally. Unfortunately, figuring out when this will happen is extremely difficult, as predicting a change in market direction has almost no rhyme or reason.

2017-05-30T00:57:57.420Z,Five Big Reasons Why People Are Still Skeptical About Bitcoin,"Lily Katz
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-30/bitcoin-s-rapid-surge-raises-reasons-to-question-latest-frenzy,"Bitcoin’s astronomical rally has cryptocurrency bulls feeling vindicated. Not so fast, skeptics say. The digital currency’s more than 100 percent surge in the past two months looks eerily familiar, argue the bears, pointing to November 2013, when the price quintupled in short order to top $1,000 for the first time. By Valentine’s Day it was worth around half that, and spent the better part of the next two years languishing below $500. Then it absolutely exploded -- jumping more than $1,400 in two months. At its height last week, one bitcoin could buy about two ounces of gold. Its champions touted the arrival of blockchain into the mainstream, the coin’s underlying technology which they say can lift the poor out of poverty and make transactions more secure, inexpensive and efficient. But signs of a top have emerged, detractors warn. On May 25, bitcoin surged more than $300 to a record only to turn tail and close little changed. The $600 round trip was the biggest daily swing in its history. It then slumped 8 percent the next day. Bitcoin was down 1.5 percent to $2,255.50 as of 12:35 p.m. in New York. For bears, that kind of volatility shows the asset’s unreliability as a store of value. Here are some other reasons why they warn caution is warranted: This month’s ransomware attacks serve as a reminder that bitcoin is still beloved by hackers and criminals because of its anonymity. The cryptocurrency plunged in 2014 after Tokyo-based Mt. Gox -- then the largest bitcoin exchange -- said it had been breached and then filed for bankruptcy. Its value sank again in August 2016 after hackers stole about $69 million from Hong Kong-based Bitfinex. The exchange has since repaid its customers. The bitcoin community has been split for more than a year on how to upgrade its blockchain. The time and fees necessary to verify transactions have climbed to record highs, making it more difficult for businesses to use the currency as a means of payment. While bitcoin executives have said that 2017 might be the year the cryptocurrency really starts to scale, others aren’t so sure. Last week, more than 50 companies signed a pact to speed up transactions, but ideological differences have prevented similar agreements -- like the one reached last year in Hong Kong -- from actually being implemented. The much-touted SegWit upgrade was also released in October, but only a third of the community has embraced it. If the latest proposal fails to gain traction and the deadlock continues, digital currency users may dump bitcoin in favor of alt-coins that offer better blockchains. As the surge sends the cryptocurrency world into a frenzy, it can be easy to lose sight of the bigger picture. While bitcoin’s value has increased more than 100 percent since the beginning of the year, its slice of the pie has shrunk as its digital cousins steal some of the spotlight. There are an estimated 700 rivals, according to Ron Quaranta, chairman of the Wall Street Blockchain Alliance. Bitcoin dominated about half of the overall digital currency market as of Friday, down from around 85 percent in February, according to data from CoinMarketCap.com. Meanwhile, Ethereum’s share increased to about 20 percent. Some token fans aren’t sweating it though, as they say bitcoin’s potential demise doesn’t really matter as long as another digital currency takes hold. The general public doesn’t understand bitcoin, and many regulators still don’t either, which makes it tough to regulate. In 2015, New York started issuing controversial licenses to cryptocurrency companies, but only three had been issued as of mid-January, according to Coinbase, as many startups couldn’t afford the costs of applying. In January, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority asked the public for help identifying the potential risks of blockchain. Two months later, bitcoin plummeted after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rejected a proposal by the Winklevoss twins for a publicly traded fund based on the digital currency. In a report last week about blockchain in China, analysts at Sanford C. Bernstein wrote that while the technology could benefit Chinese banks, it’s unlikely to start a financial revolution. ""We believe blockchain application is more likely to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary in developing countries like China,"" the analysts said. ""Aside from the conservative regulatory attitudes toward financial innovations, the constraint of confidentiality and performance of blockchain technology would make it best positioned to be enterprise-oriented rather than consumer-end."" Whether it’s Holland’s tulip-bulb craze in the 17th century or the Internet-stock frenzy of the late 1990s, history shows that markets self correct. Speculative markets usually run out of steam at some point. Determining the trigger is always the hard part. Given the breathtaking run in bitcoin as of late, some say it’s tough to believe the oft-cited mantra that this time is different. — With assistance by Yuji Nakamura"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-06/blogging-bonds-and-bathrooms,"Spoofing, etc. If I were an ambitious securities regulator or prosecutor, I would spend a few minutes each morning reading blog posts with titles like ""Why I Quit my Investment Banking Job to Start a Tech Company."" There seem to be new ones every day, and you never know what you might find in them. For instance, if the author discusses his time as a trader at an investment bank and says that he was ""uncomfortable with some of the things I witnessed/experienced,"" an alert regulator might call him up and ask: Well, what, specifically? Was it mortgage fraud? Insider trading? Spoofing?  I don't know how the Feds got David Liew but I sure hope it was from his blog post: Liew, who traded precious metals for Deutsche Bank AG in Singapore, pleaded guilty last week to spoofing charges. (He also settled with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission for spoofing and triggering stop orders.) He has agreed to cooperate with prosecutors to go after some of the other things he witnessed/experienced: A tip for traders: It might be fun to call yourself ""The Legend"" for your spoofing prowess, but resist that temptation. ""The Legend,"" ""The London Whale,"" ""Lord Libor"": All of these are bad nicknames. If you are ever prosecuted for your misdeeds, you want your nickname to be, like, ""the Staten Island Minnow,"" or ""Go-With-the-Flow Pete,"" or ""Ol' Whatsisname."" Anyway, as you might expect, an ex-trader who was disgruntled and indiscreet enough to blog about his discomfort also wrote some dumb stuff in electronic chats. Spoofing is hard to prove without evidence of intent, but it is very easy to prove if you have lots of electronically preserved chats with other traders explaining how you are spoofing: Sadly his blog post has been deleted, so you and I may never know why Liew quit his trading job to start a tech company, but the important thing is that the FBI does.  Venezuela. Last week, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. got in some public-relations trouble when it came out that Goldman Sachs Asset Management had bought some Venezuelan bonds from the government, arguably helping to prop up President Nicolás Maduro's ... the standard word is ""embattled"" ... government. (One economist worries that the government ""might use the money on tear gas against protesters."") One weird thing about the transaction is that Goldman bought the bonds for 31 cents on the dollar. That's not that weird; Venezuela is in bad shape, and its bonds are trading well below par. But it is a little weird to buy government bonds directly from the government at a big discount to par. That's not precisely what happened -- the bonds were issued in 2014 by Petroleos de Venezuela SA, the state oil company, in a private placement to Venezuela's central bank, which then sold them to Goldman through an intermediary this year -- but, economically, it kind of looks like that. The bonds were never sold to an unaffiliated third party for cash until they went to Goldman. When we first talked about the trade, I asked: The traditional answer would be no: If a government sells a new bond for 31 cents on the dollar, then it is an original-issue-discount bond and its claim in a restructuring would be 31 cents (accreting up to par over time). If the government did a restructuring, then someone with a 31-cent original-issue-discount claim could expect to get back only about one-third as much as someone with a par claim, even if that par claim was also trading for 31 cents on the dollar in the secondary market. I am not sure that that traditional answer applies here, since Goldman's bonds are not new (issued in 2014) and not government bonds (issued by PdVSA), but I am not sure it doesn't, either.  It's not just a question for Goldman, though, since Venezuela's main financing source these days seems to be finding old bonds that it issued to itself and reselling them at a discount: The bonds were originally issued ""by Venezuela’s government in a private placement to state-run Banco de Venezuela,"" so they too have remained within the government; now they're being shopped at a discount. Which worries investors: Deal fees.  The best reason for a company to pay investment bankers tens of millions of dollars to help negotiate a mergers or acquisition is that, if the bankers are good at their job, they can add (or subtract) hundreds of millions of dollars to the sale price. But this is hard to signal in advance. You can't just walk in to a pitch and say ""oh I am really good at negotiating higher prices."" I mean, you can, but anyone can say that; how do you prove it? You can point to data -- maybe your deal premiums are higher than other banks' premiums, for instance -- but this data is famously manipulable, and every deal is different, and getting a small premium on a hard deal may be more impressive than getting a big premium on an easy one. You can lay out some of your strategy in the pitch -- have a page saying ""we plan to contact large sovereign wealth funds and ask them to pay a lot of money"" -- but that doesn't really give the client a sense of your ability to think on your feet in negotiations. More satisfyingly, you can try to build a relationship with the company. This is partly general salesmanship -- the more you hang out with the chief executive officer, the more she will feel like she owes you the M&A mandate -- but if you actually have negotiating skill, then the CEO might notice it during your relationship. You'll give the CEO some free advice on negotiating to hire a new employee, or on dealing with an internal business issue, and maybe she'll think ""oh hey this guy is pretty good at giving negotiating advice"" and be more inclined to hire you for the big M&A assignment. Or, of course, there is word of mouth: CEOs who are happy with their investment bankers will tell their CEO friends, who will also go hire those bankers. Best of all, the CEOs who are happy with their investment bankers can tell a newspaper, preferably in colorful language: I hope they gave him a discount in exchange for that five-star review! (Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman, and I am therefore biased to favor this sort of shameless glorification of the firm.) Imagine going into an M&A pitch with a pitchbook page saying ""we will tell you not to talk to the buyers in the bathroom during due diligence."" That is not a good slide! (Imagine the clip art!) And yet it's the thing that stuck out to this former client, and that convinced him that Goldman's skill is what got him a 40 percent premium.  Steve Schwarzman. The best thing in this Bloomberg Markets interview with Steve Schwarzman -- besides his fondness for ""Law & Order"" reruns -- is the sort of fairy-tale quality to how opportunities seem to come in to the Blackstone Group LP. For instance, Schwarzman had been pursuing GSO Capital Partners for a while without success, but then after Blackstone went public this apparently happened: Do you think that is a common occurrence, in the world of public companies? Like people just show up at your door and say ""I read your prospectus and it brought a tear to my eye. I think your company is just so wonderful that I want you to have my company too."" That is an effective prospectus! The lawyers who drafted it should be very proud. Also here is how Blackstone got a large equity infusion from the Chinese government: The whole trick, in finance, is to work very hard to put  yourself in a position so that one day, when you are sitting at home watching ""Law & Order,"" a stranger will call you up and offer you $3 billion. Dalio vs. Trump. Ray Dalio has been a very successful hedge fund manager but don't you sort of wish that he'd take a sabbatical to serve as Donald Trump's ... chief of staff? Life coach? Therapist? Spiritual adviser? That is a reality television show that I would watch, just Dalio and Trump meeting every day, Trump listing his accomplishments and grievances, Dalio saying things like this: That's from Dalio's LinkedIn post yesterday. ""Trying to figure out Donald Trump's perspective, what choices he will make, and their feedback loops has been an interesting and challenging puzzle to try to solve,"" says Dalio. One thing that I tend to think about Bridgewater Associates is that its""Principles""-based management approach is not so much a blueprint for managing a hedge fund as it is a philosophy for living a good life, a set of techniques for solving the puzzle of life, not of financial markets. I think Bridgewater is at its core a quasi-religious organization whose purpose is to help its members find meaning and fulfillment and self-mastery. (The money is a byproduct, and frankly the link between the employees' self-knowledge and the firm's profits has always seemed a bit tenuous to me.) If that's right, then there is no particular reason for Dalio to confine himself to coaching his own employees. There might be other people who have more urgent need for his help. Of course, Dalio has said that Bridgewater's approach of radical self-reflection is ""not for everyone,"" and if there's anyone for whom it's not, it's probably Donald Trump.  Elsewhere, it's Larry Summers vs. Jamie Dimon on Donald Trump. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Jim Greco is skeptical about current blockchains-in-finance efforts: ""Blockchain startups are going to need to spend a lot more time in the weeds solving real-world problems in finance before distributed ledgers take over the back office."" The big problems are anonymity (""By definition, there are no anonymous transactions in a distributed ledger!"") and speed (""In a distributed ledger, you are continuously reconciling the entire system’s transactions""), and it is not clear that a distributed ledger is an improvement over a centralized ledger kept by a trusted counterparty. On the other hand it's clearly an improvement over some things: That is my basic thinking about blockchain in finance: If shouting the word ""blockchain!"" makes people more enthusiastic about modernizing creaky old systems, then more power to them, even if the blockchain is not the optimal way to modernize those systems. Elsewhere: There's a bitcoin comedian who asks audiences, ""Do we have any libertarians in the house?"" Yes, yes you do. People are worried about non-GAAP accounting. Well here is a short animated movie about the glories of U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. (""The Summer Movie About Accounting You Won't Want to Miss,"" says the Wall Street Journal, for some value of ""you."") One thing that you sometimes hear is that GAAP numbers are ""real"" numbers, and that companies reporting non-GAAP numbers are using ""fantasy math"" or whatever. What I liked about this little film is that it seems to have been made by accountants, who know that nothing works that way. It doesn't advertise GAAP as representing objective reality; it advertises GAAP as a useful human-made coordination system. It analogizes GAAP to traffic rules. There is no moral importance or objective truth involved in driving on the right or stopping on red and going on green; the value is that everyone agrees to follow the same rules. Similarly the value of GAAP is not so much that it reflects reality -- though it does the best it can -- but that it is generally accepted. Elsewhere: ""Tech Teams Rush to Catch Up as New Accounting Rule Looms."" People are worried about bond market liquidity. It's been a while since we talked about the worry that exchange-traded funds might create a liquidity illusion in which ETF buyers think that they own liquid securities but are then surprised by the illiquidity of the underlying bonds, but my Bloomberg View colleague Noah Smith is worried about it: Things happen.

Oil jumped, Qatari stocks plunged, and the volume of shares traded in Doha was more than 10-times the intraday average. The moves by the Saudis, Bahrain, the U.A.E. and Egypt came barely a week after U.S. President Donald Trump visited the region and joined Saudi Arabia in lambasting Iran for sponsoring terrorism from Syria to Yemen. Why does tiny Qatar anger its neighbors so much? Here's the answer.  London police adjust to new terror threat with guns and helicopters. Eight minutes after Saturday night's terror rampage started, a special-forces chopper had landed on London Bridge, police had fired 50 rounds and the three attackers were dead. It's a significant change for a police force whose officers are generally unarmed. Asia is losing faith in America. U.S. President Donald Trump’s unpredictability, transactional approach to foreign policy and perceived disinterest in alliances were overwhelming topics of concern at the annual Shangri-La meeting of defense ministers and other security officials that wrapped up on Sunday. Americans are ho-hum on Japan's stock rally. Even with a stronger yen to boost returns in dollars, Americans aren't impressed with Japanese equities. They're more excited about Europe — especially after the French presidential election — and Asian emerging markets, according to Goldman Sachs. Investors in the Wild West of tech are making a killing. Forget U.S. stocks and emerging market assets, and even ignore bitcoin — demand for other digital coins is surging. If you can stomach the risk the rewards could be substantial, but the sector isn't for the faint-hearted. This enzyme is the new focus for cancer treatment. For a fetus in the womb, it means life, a shield from a mother’s immune system that would otherwise fight the embryo as an infection. Gone rogue, it can mean death — protecting malignant tumors from attacks by the body’s defenses. That enzyme, IDO, was the talk of the town at the largest gathering of cancer researchers in the world this past weekend. It's now the target of the next wave of cancer research.  Rest assured, China has its economy's back. The People’s Bank of China has surprised many with its tolerance for market pain as it squeezes leverage in parts of the financial system. But, economists say, China won’t clamp down so hard it endangers President Xi Jinping’s goal to keep growth above 6.5 percent.  "
2017-06-05T13:35:44.867Z,Venezuelan Bonds and Niche ETFs,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-05/venezuelan-bonds-and-niche-etfs,"Venezuela. The controversy over Goldman Sachs Asset Management's purchase of Venezuelan government bonds (really Petroleos de Venezuela SA bonds) from Venezuela's government (really from a small broker acting on behalf of Venezuela's central bank) has gone on longer than Goldman probably expected, given that Goldman apparently didn't think about it at all: Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s ""compliance and legal staff are reviewing the purchase"" to see ""how the process can be improved,"" but you can see how they missed this. It's controversial for Goldman to buy controversial stuff; but GSAM isn't quite Goldman. It manages money on behalf of customers; it bought the bonds with their money, not shareholder money. Its decisions aren't, in some sense, made on behalf of Goldman Sachs; they're made on behalf of GSAM's customers. Of course those decisions are made by Goldman employees in Goldman offices, not by the customers, but still, there is some deniability there. (Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman.) There is deniability for the customers too: Sure they own and benefit from the Venezuelan bonds, but they didn't decide to buy them; Goldman did. Somehow Venezuelan bonds are owned without anyone fully taking the responsibility of owning them. Elsewhere in deniability, Ricardo Hausmann wrote last month about the moral taint of buying Venezuela's ""Hunger Bonds."" His argument is not quite that people shouldn't buy Venezuelan bonds. That would be too radical: Emerging-market bond funds almost have to invest in Venezuelan bonds. ""The returns of the JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index (EMBI+) are heavily influenced by what happens in Venezuela,"" because Venezuela's bonds make up a lot of the yield and the price volatility of the index. Emerging-markets managers can't just walk away from Venezuela; they ""currently spend a disproportionate share of their time 'getting the Venezuelan call right,' because their bonuses are based on their over-performance relative to the index – of which Venezuela is the main driver."" And investors can't just walk away from emerging-markets bond funds: The assumption here is that investment managers, and individual investors, cannot be expected to make moral decisions about investing for themselves, not when an index lurks in the background. (Others disagree; here is a story about Venezuelan investors who wrestle with the moral issues of owning Venezuelan government bonds.) Morality, on this theory, is a matter for index providers to judge. Investors -- index funds, yes, but also active funds that benchmark to an index -- are bound to follow the index, so if anyone is going to make a moral decision about what bonds to avoid, it is the index provider. I am not sure the index providers would agree! JPMorgan is not in the business of saving you from moral anguish. An index is just a list. Venezuela is an emerging market. It has bonds. Its bonds are emerging-markets bonds. If you are writing a list of emerging-markets bonds, you could quite sensibly put Venezuelan bonds on that list. What is the problem? But one thing that we talk about a lot around here is the human construction of investment indexes. The central idea of indexing, of passive investing, is that you own the entire universe of assets rather than making choices about what to buy. But in practice it's never that simple. Most actual indexes aren't really ""the entire universe of assets""; they're a particular subset of that universe, U.S. large-cap stocks or emerging-market bonds or whatever. And even within that subset, the membership criteria have to be defined by a human, with some room for judgment calls. And increasingly judgments by index constructors are overtaking judgments by investors in importance: If investors give up their agency to index providers -- if the index providers are the only people actually making decisions about governance or profitability or morality -- then the index providers had better make good decisions.  The future of passive. The central idea of indexing, of passive investing, is that you own the entire universe of assets rather than making choices about what to buy, and also it's cheap. I mean: You just buy all the stocks on the list, and then you stop. There's no need to hire brilliant analysts and portfolio managers and pay them millions of dollars to pick stocks. There are some pretty significant economies of scale: One person can pick all the stocks for a $40 billion index fund as easily as for a $40 million index fund, and doesn't need to be paid 1,000 times as much. So it is not that surprising that BlackRock Inc., Vanguard Group and State Street Corp. combine for 83 percent of the U.S. market for exchange-traded funds. ETFs are mostly passive vehicles, passive investors want low fees, and scale is how you get low fees. But there's still another 17 percent for smaller ETF providers to fight over, and this Bloomberg Markets article details their approaches. Here is my favorite, from Deutsche Asset Management, which uses the traditional financial-industry marketing approach of clothing metaphors: See, it's bespoke! I mean arguably providing service is the past of active management; arguably investors have concluded that actually they were overpaying for service and what they really want is to be handed a cheap broad market index and be left alone. But obviously that is not true of all ETFs, or all ETF investors: Many investors want narrowly focused ETFs with lots of trading opportunities -- active management by other means -- and providers are happy to give it to them. Elsewhere in niche ETFs, I wrote on Friday about Dani Burger's ""cat"" index, and the need (or lack thereof) for a human-legible economic intuition underlying a factor. About a dozen people reminded me of Robert Mercer's line in Sebastian Mallaby's ""More Money Than God"": Perhaps there is still hope for the cat factor. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Central banks seem to love thinking and writing about bitcoins and blockchains, which I guess makes sense. If you are a central bank, your basic job is to keep an electronic list of who has dollars or pounds or whatever, so you might be particularly interested in new ways of keeping electronic lists of who has money. There is not usually a lot of breaking news in Keeping Lists of Money Quarterly, so it's understandable that the blockchain stuff has caught the eye of a lot of central bankers. But the blockchain is not an obvious fit for central banks. The point of a blockchain is to decentralize the keeping of ledgers of assets. Central banks have ""central"" right in the name. I once said: ""the central bank issues the money; it could just keep a list of how much money everyone has, and that could be the official list, and that would be that. You don't need a blockchain.""  But here is Simon Scorer at the Bank of England's Bank Underground blog with what I think is the most sensible thing about blockchains I've read from a central bank. In particular, Scorer thinks that the main benefit of using a blockchain ""is the high level of operational resilience it might offer by avoiding a single point of failure"": The main solutions are ""to not include sensitive data on the shared ledger,"" which ""may limit the extent of any resiliency benefits"" (if the shared ledger doesn't include actual transaction details, it's not really usefully shared), or to include the data but fully encrypt it, which ""presents a significant challenge in asking a group of participants to agree on the validity of transactions, without allowing them to see the full details.""  Elsewhere in blockchains: Possible bitcoin unicorn! And: ""The number of job adverts on LinkedIn for blockchain-related positions has more than trebled in the past year.""  Elsewhere in central banking. Here is ""(Why) Do Central Banks Care About Their Profits?"" by Igor Goncharov and Vasso Ioannidou of Lancaster University and Martin Schmalz of the University of Michigan: ""The discontinuity is unlikely to be a mechanical byproduct of the central banking business model,"" they write, ""and more likely the result of imperfect de facto independence of the central bank."" The more worried the bank is about its independence, the more pressure there is on it to say ""well, at least we are profitable."" Elsewhere: ""Have the Swiss National Bank’s currency interventions actually been good for Switzerland?""  John Paulson. Of all the problems to have, the problem of client withdrawals leaving your hedge fund with just $2 billion in client money to go with $8 billion of your personal money is the least bad problem. Oh I know, I know, people think it's a problem for John Paulson, who at his peak ""oversaw $38 billion -- half of which belonged to outside investors.""  But the central fact is that he is still running $8 billion of his own money, which means that he has $8 billion of his own money, which means that his problem is better than anything that has ever happened to almost anyone else on Earth.  Management methods. One possibly out-of-consensus belief that I have is that there are not a lot of classic supervillain scenes at modern public companies. A popular view of the financial crisis, for instance, is that there was a meeting in an executive dining room at Goldman Sachs where the head trader said ""let's trick our clients into buying bad mortgages so we can profit from the coming crisis,"" and then the CEO said ""yes and then we can take everyone's houses,"" and then the general counsel said ""also I just want to add that this is a crime and I love it,"" and then they cackled and tossed around wads of cash, and that if prosecutors could just find the videotape of that meeting then we could finally achieve justice and put the crisis behind us. I do not think that happened. I think that most of the time, when a company does a bad thing, it is the result of a series of smaller local decisions that were understandable in their own terms, that most people don't knowingly choose to do bad stuff, and that when they do, they are shamefaced about it and don't go around gloating with each other. People who work at big corporations -- even banks! -- are, in my experience, people, and explicit self-aware evil seems to be unusual among people everywhere. But Charles Duhigg notes that Mylan NV's EpiPen, which was hugely controversial last year for how expensive it is, remains just as expensive. And he reports that, starting in 2014, Mylan executives ""began warning Mylan’s top leaders that the price increases seemed like unethical profiteering at the expense of sick children and adults."" And that one of those top leaders was chairman Robert Coury, and that this happened: Ah. Yes. What? For some reason I imagine him keeping the middle fingers up throughout what sounds like a fairly long tirade. You know how boards of directors sometimes go into executive session? Maybe Mylan's sometimes goes into Double Extended Middle Finger Session, in which everyone just vents about their critics. Mylan says that ""any allegations of disregard for consumers who need these lifesaving drugs, government officials, regulators or any other of our valued stakeholders are patently false."" Elsewhere, Ronald Barusch argues that ""Investors concerned about governance and shareholder control should think twice about investing in companies organized under Dutch law,"" like Mylan: Presumably the binding nominations are made in a Double Extended Middle Finger Session of the nominating committee. People are worried about unicorns. Here is a story about Palmer Luckey, who founded and sold virtual-reality unicorn Oculus VR to Facebook Inc., ""was pressured to leave Facebook months after news spread that he had secretly donated to an organization dedicated to spreading anti-Hillary Clinton internet memes,"" and is now working on a new startup, to be funded by Peter Thiel, that will make a virtual border wall. Also he likes cosplay and collects decommissioned missile silos. ""A person who knows him described Mr. Luckey as a casual 'prepper,' someone who prepares for societal collapse,"" and really who among us is not at least casually preparing for societal collapse?  Things happen.

         & Yuji Nakamura
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-29/japan-s-bitpoint-to-add-bitcoin-payments-to-100-000s-of-outlets,"BITPoint Japan Co., the company behind Peach Aviation Ltd.’s move to let travelers use bitcoin to pay for tickets, is planning to give hundreds of thousands of Japanese retail outlets the ability to accept the digital currency. “We’re holding discussions with a retail-related company,” Genki Oda, BITPoint’s president, said in a recent interview. “By going through a company providing payment terminal services to shops, we have the possibility of increasing its use at one stroke. It’s easier than talking to lots of individual retailers.” BITPoint is joining a flurry of companies embracing regulations, enacted in Japan last month, that recognize digital currencies as a form of payment. That has helped to make yen trades one of the world’s largest transaction pools, exceeding China’s pole position at the end of 2016, according to Oda. Bic Camera Inc., one of the country’s biggest electronics retailers, began accepting bitcoin at two stores in Tokyo last month. “We’re also talking to a big convenience store operator about using it,” said Oda, 36, who also runs BITPoint parent Remixpoint Co., which had a market value of about 21 billion yen ($189 million) on Friday. He said he’s aiming to make an announcement by early next year. The shares of Remixpoint rose as much as 18 percent to their daily price limit. Last week, Remixpoint said it will convert debt issued to BITPoint into equity, raising its ownership in the subsidiary to 97.7 percent. Bitcoin, which debuted eight years ago, is gaining wider use as a way to pay for goods and services, and lets people transact without oversight from governments, regulators or central banks. The virtual currency has been rallying against the dollar and other fiat currencies and was trading at $2,210 on Monday, near record highs. While BITPoint operates as a bitcoin exchange, it’s pushing to promote the use of the cryptocurrency in stores and other retail outlets, instead of as a speculative instrument. The company currently has ties with tens of retailers and plans to expand that number, Oda said. A change in Japanese law on April 1 formalized rules around anti-money laundering and put in place standards for security and audits. Restaurant booking site Gurunavi Inc. will start letting diners pay with bitcoin later this year, the Nikkei newspaper reported last month. “It’s funny how the whole narrative of bitcoin being risky or dangerous has changed, and it is now seen as a form of pride to regulate and embrace it,” said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Hong Kong-based bitcoin exchange Gatecoin. Asked about the recent climb in bitcoin’s value, Oda said he’s wary of the sudden jump and doesn’t think it’s sustainable. At the same time, Japanese investors and day traders are taking a serious look at bitcoin as an asset class, thanks to the new regulations, he said, adding that several large foreign exchange brokerages will begin bitcoin trading in the coming months, boosting volumes. Still, it’s unclear whether bitcoin payments can become more than a marketing gimmick. The biggest hurdles include long network confirmation times and high transaction fees. While many bitcoin community members rallied around a new proposal last week to fix the problem, deep differences within the group have led to several similar solutions falling through since 2015."
2017-06-01T15:40:38.849Z,Your Evening Briefing,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-06-01/your-evening-briefing-j3el830d,"The evening briefing will soon be available in your inbox every day. Sign up here. It’s a bleak prospect. Billionaire investor George Soros penned an editorial on Thursday predicting it may take the U.K. as long as five years to leave the European Union, concluding that Brexit “is certain to be immensely damaging to both sides.” He urged the world’s biggest trading bloc to avoid penalizing Britain and instead focus on reforming itself. With ongoing uncertainty over the upcoming June 8 general election, Bloomberg’s Brexit Barometer continued to slide today, hitting fresh lows.— Andy Reinhardt And yet, London’s Brexit apocalypse is nowhere in sight. In the year Britons voted to leave the EU, much has been made of the fear that London stands to lose its status as a global financial center. That hard-won title was achieved over decades by people, capital, and policies. Despite political turbulence, London is determined to show the world it can continue to dominate global finance, Europe be damned. Chip on his shoulder? Russian president Vladimir Putin used the occasion of the St. Petersburg International Economic Forum to accuse the West trying to prevent the emergence of a multi-polar world by countering his country’s efforts to assert itself on the global stage. He later added that he likes guys like Donald Trump and wants to build better relations with the U.S. leader, even though swirling controversies in Washington are making it difficult for Trump to govern. Norwegians are switching to electric vehicles, fast. In fact, they’re adopting them faster than anyone else on the planet, with more than a third of all new cars purchased either fully electric or plug-in hybrids. The government says that by 2025 there may be no gasoline- or diesel-powered cars sold. The electric boom is built on generous government incentives, including exemptions from car-purchase tax and sales tax. Norway’s small population and plentiful, cheap hydroelectricity help, too. Step aside, bitcoin. The value of ether, the digital currency linked to the ethereum blockchain, could surpass that of bitcoin by the end of 2018. Bitcoin currently dominates a little less than half of the digital currency market, down from almost 90 percent three months ago. The Nordic tiger. After years known as the new “sick man of Europe,” Finland is on the mend. In the first three months of 2017 the economy grew the fastest in seven years, thanks to a five percent increase in exports. Record-high consumer confidence, an expanded workforce and abundant industrial order books are all positive signs. It’s an auspicious start to the year Finland marks a century of independence from Russia. Workers of the world, drool. Staff working in Google’s planned new U.K. headquarters will have no excuse not to keep fit.

To be among the first to get it, sign up here. Morgan Stanley's Chief Executive Officer James Gorman is very encouraged by the performance of the U.S. economy. He points to falling unemployment, a recovery in house prices, stabilizing local and state government deficits and some signs of quickening inflation. And Gorman's upbeat on Asia. He plays down worries over China’s economy and says the focus shouldn’t be on the overall growth rate, but on the size of the $11 trillion economy. On the business front, the chief executive says his firm is seeing trading declines similar to its competitors. Gorman made the comments in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg Television in Beijing.— Brent O'BrienChina must rein in an increasingly reckless North Korea, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said in an exclusive interview with Bloomberg Television's Haidi Lun. Speaking ahead of his most-anticipated foreign policy speech since becoming prime minister in September 2015, Turnbull also urged China to respect the rule of law as its economic and military might grows.Australian house prices fell in May for the first time in 17 months. It's an early sign lending restrictions are starting to damp demand. And interest in Sydney property may be set to drop further after the state government announced a doubling of the stamp duty on purchases made by overseas investors. It's all part of a package aimed at appeasing voter anger over sky-high housing costs.Southeast Asia is the first stop on China's road to global tech domination. The region, which has twice the population of the U.S. and the largest Chinese diaspora in the world, is the primary target for ever-wealthier investors from the mainland who have already poured billions into everything from transport to real estate. Chinese investments in technology abroad more than doubled to $37.8 billion last year, and more deals are in the works.Step aside, bitcoin. There’s another digital token in town that’s winning over the hearts and wallets of cryptocurrency enthusiasts across the globe. The value of ether, the digital currency linked to the ethereum blockchain, could surpass that of bitcoin by the end of 2018. China's been assembling one of the essential engines of global power. Ship by ship, port by port, over the past two decades the nation has put together a modern navy capable of projecting force far from home.  It will no doubt be on the minds of Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis and others gathering in Singapore this weekend for Asia’s most high-profile security conference, the Shangri-La dialogue.It's the elite $156,000 supercar no one is talking about. The 2017 Acura NSXs have been on the road for a year now, but chances are, you haven’t seen one. It suffers from a weak public image because of its association with the hordes of forgettable Acuras out there. That’s too bad, because it more than deserves to be considered in the same vaunted category as the Audi R8, the Mercedes AMG GT, and even the McLaren 570S.  "

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-01/multiplication-gaming-and-writing,"Scamilton II. Yesterday was my birthday, and the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York got me an amazing present, this alleged Ponzi scheme in which a former math teacher named Jason Nissen allegedly scammed several big investors out of $70 million by falsely claiming that he was using their money to buy and resell tickets to ""Hamilton"" and other events. It should not be confused with the alleged Ponzi scheme from earlier this year in which the operators allegedly scammed several big investors out of $81 million by falsely claiming that they were using their money to buy and resell tickets to ""Hamilton"" and other events. That case was fine, but it's now distinctly the second-best eight-figure fake-""Hamilton""-tickets scam of 2017.  What makes Nissen's alleged Hamilponzi so superior is that he apparently got sad about it, visited one of his victims (""Executive-1""), confessed everything, and then went home to think about what he had done. At which point the investor called him up to clarify a few things, on a recorded line, leading to this exchange: It's the real numbers, but multiplied. Vast new fields of legal-mathematical theory open vertiginously beneath us. It's not fraud; it's multiplication. Everything he said was true, up to a linear transformation. Of course all numbers are the real numbers (in the legal sense, not the math one) multiplied by other numbers. Is it a defense if your numbers are divisible by the real numbers? Do they have to be integer multiples? Do you need a constant multiple for all the numbers, or can you multiply each real number by its own other number? What if the real number is zero? You can't multiply that by anything to get an appealing number; is it okay to resort to addition? Executive-1 then invited Nissen in to his company's office to discuss the Ponzi scheme in more detail, on video, with some of his colleagues, including ""CFO-1."" It turns out that Nissen's methods extended beyond arithmetic: Ever hear of multiplication? It seems to have taken an understandably long time for the facts to sink in on the victims; they kept asking Nissen variations on ""wait really you ripped us off?"" Though at least they had the presence of mind to tape everything, and he apparently had the absence of mind to keep confessing: The exchange ends there, in the complaint. CFO-1's characterization has no legal relevance; it's not like CFO-1's zinger is evidence against Nissen. The FBI agent writing the complaint just wanted to give CFO-1 the last word. And it's a good line! I have recently been cited in a federal criminal fraud complaint myself, so I'm an old pro at this sort of thing, but I didn't get a cool speaking role like CFO-1. I am a bit jealous. Of course I also wasn't defrauded by the second ""Hamilton"" Ponzi scheme this year. StockStream. We are at the doorstep of a truly modern age of investing, and it is boring. Some day soon, most people will index. Others will buy factors and stuff; there will be math, and computers. The giants of the earlier, more romantic age of investing are on their way out -- retired, running family offices, reinventing themselves as quant managers, or just reeling off consecutive down years. Everyone knows now that frantic day-trading of individual stocks is dumb, and that buying and holding low-cost index funds is virtuous. Everything is becoming rational and orderly, low-cost and low-vol. It is the right thing to do; you know it is. And yet it is dull. But while modern technology helped to create this clean, sensible, rational, boring approach, it also helped to create the reaction, the excrescences of zany irrationality that pop up to relieve the dullness of our basically sensible world. Do you know how many Ponzi schemes there are on Ethereum? So many! Also here is a guy who has set up a game on Twitch where people can tell him what stocks to buy: Here is the Twitch stream. There is a blippy-bloopy soundtrack. The most popular votes when I looked at one point yesterday were, first, Sell Tesla, and second, Buy Tesla. He will probably end up a billionaire. ""The wisdom of the crowd,"" people will say. ""Why index when you can gamify your investing,"" people will say. ""Whee this is fun let's make him buy more Tesla,"" people will say. It's not exactly less boring than indexing, for my tastes, but it is boring in a new way, and seems to satisfy both the players' urge to make baseless hair-trigger investment decisions and Roberts' urge to hand his savings over to inscrutable chance. Both of those urges feel like understandable reactions to the modern world. Marcus. A major but unheralded problem in banking is: Where can you write things? Sure, you have paper, but what if you run out of paper? What if you write something on paper, and then lose the paper? What if your handwriting is too big to fit on the paper? Or what if you want to signal that you're really, really cool? Like, much cooler than the conventional squares who write on paper? Well, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has always been at the cutting edge of financial innovation, and now it has broken new ground in finding places to write, also nose rings: It's true, I used to work at Goldman, and I only wrote on paper and whiteboards. (Also sometimes I used a computer?) That quote is from Omer Ismail of Marcus, Goldman's consumer lending business, whose logo really should be a sepia-toned portrait of its 19th-century namesake, but with a nose ring. And maybe some equations scrawled on him.  I blame the index funds. Exxon Mobil Corp.'s shareholders voted yesterday, over the opposition of the board of directors, to require the company to produce an annual report on ""the long-term portfolio impacts of technological advances and global climate change policies."" These proposals are of course partly about useful financial disclosure -- investors want to know what the impact of climate change policies will be on the bottom line -- but that is not their only purpose; there's a reason that the people pushing for climate-change disclosures also seem to be the people most substantively concerned about climate change. The point is to fight climate change; to force oil companies to think about and respond to and disclose the risk of climate change, and hopefully to change their own activities in ways that mitigate it. But the people voting for this particular proposal weren't traditional activists: A story that we talk a lot about around here is that broadly diversified institutions don't just care about profit maximizing at any one firm: They own whole industries, whole economies, and so have interests that diverge from those of concentrated shareholders in a single company. The negative spin on that is that the diversified investors can create antitrust problems: They disfavor competition and favor fat-margined oligopolies; they promote shareholder interests at the expense of workers and customers. But there are positive spins too. If you're an indexer, you internalize the externalities! If you just own Exxon Mobil, you might want it to sell a lot of oil and make a lot of money. If you also own, I don't know, coastal real-estate companies, you might care more about the environmental effects of your Exxon investment. Fund companies that own the whole economy might be better stewards of that economy than concentrated investors are. Obviously a world in which BlackRock sets all industrial policy for the entire economy would be weird. But BlackRock does have some good incentives. Artificial intelligence. Investing involves rigorously and quantitatively analyzing mountains of information in order to come to dispassionate disciplined decisions, so you would think that computers would have some advantages over humans. On the other hand investment advising involves soft skills, befriending clients and getting them to trust you, so you would think that humans would have some advantages over computers. And you might think that a human-computer combination would be an unbeatable team for investment advising, with the computer contributing its cold rationality and the human contributing her people skills. Morgan Stanley seems to agree, except that it's counting on the computer to provide the people skills: The computer is definitely going to be better at remembering the client's birthday: The thing about investing is that, while the work is complicated, the goal is pretty simple: You should buy stuff that will go up. The basic dream of artificial intelligence in investing is to get a computer to figure out what stuff will go up, and various quant hedge funds are working on that problem. But the investment advising business has a slightly different objective: not to find the things that will go up and buy them, but to find the things that you'll buy and sell them to you. That's a different problem from just finding what will go up, probably an easier problem, and one that has traditionally relied on the human touch. But perhaps it too is susceptible to computerization. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Ian Bogost is worried that ""Cryptocurrency Might be a Path to Authoritarianism"": ""Instead of defanging governments and big corporations, the distributed ledger offers those domains enormous incentive to consolidate their power and influence."" Does it? I am not sure that distributed ledgers, or cryptocurrency, do all that much for centralized power. But it is true that corporate and governmental skepticism of bitcoin has quickly morphed into corporate and governmental interest in the blockchain, and ""blockchain"" there means less ""decentralized trustless distributed ledger"" and more, like, ""ledger."" It does seem empirically true that a lot of hyped blockchain projects seem to be about concentrating information in centralized intermediaries, rather than the reverse. If the interest in blockchain becomes an interest in just having better databases, and running smart contracts automatically, then yes I can see how that might consolidate the power of corporations and governments. Meanwhile, Ethereum is gaining cryptocurrency market share from bitcoin. People are worried about unicorns. Here is Priya Anand on Uber Technologies Inc.'s efforts to popularize UberPool, which involved losing ""sometimes well over $1 million a week in San Francisco alone"" by discounting fares. It also almost involved this: You have to sort of admire Uber's bluntness. ""Give Up Your Keys,"" as a slogan, manages to be both boring and menacing. The focus is not on what Uber can do for you, or even on what you can do for Uber, but on what you can sacrifice to demonstrate your loyalty to Uber. Anyway, Anand calls Pool ""a case study of the ride-hail juggernaut’s burn-now-and-figure-it-out-later corporate ethos at a moment when it is still struggling to pinpoint a sustainable business model."" Elsewhere, Uber's ""first-quarter loss was $708 million, shrinking from the $991 million loss in the previous period,"" and revenue increased to $3.4 billion. I guess they are still burning it, but also slowly figuring it out. Meanwhile, in tech gender-equity news: ""At Top VC Firms, More Women Partners Doesn’t Mean More Women Funded."" But: ""Venture Capital Firms With More Teenage Daughters Perform Better."" People are worried about bond market liquidity. This worry is a ghost town recently, but no one seems to be trading bonds: And: Things happen. London’s Brexit Apocalypse Is Nowhere in Sight. Wells Fargo barred from business with New York City.

Inflation slowdown could crimp Fed’s tightening plans, Merkel hails India as a “reliable partner,” and bitcoin bubble might be bursting. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. The Fed’s preferred gauge of price pressures decelerated to an annual pace of 1.5 percent in April, leaving the risks to the central bank’s year-end forecast for inflation tilted to the downside. Speaking Tuesday, Federal Reserve Governor Lael Brainard said that persistently soft inflation would cause her to “reassess the appropriate path of policy.” Market-implied odds suggest that a rate hike in June is a likely event, but traders have also cooled to the notion of another increase in September. The world order that’s persisted since WWII has shown signs of fraying, prompting new geopolitical alliances to be contemplated. To this end, India’s ties with Europe appear to be on a firmer footing. Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chancellor Angela Merkel met in Berlin, with the German leader calling India “a reliable partner,” in stark contrast to comments she directed toward the U.S. this weekend after the G-7 summit, expressing doubt in transatlantic alliances. U.S. President Donald Trump had blasted Germany for its failure to spend a sufficient amount on collective defense as part of NATO as well as its massive trade surplus.  Bitcoin has slumped roughly 20 percent after hitting all-time highs last week. This could be the beginning of the end for the cryptocurrency bubble—or a brief pause in the rally that’s seen it rise more than 130 percent so far this year. Turning to more conventional assets, U.S. stocks fell from all-time highs with a modest decline Tuesday to snap a seven-session winning streak. U.S. Treasuries gained while the dollar dipped. S&P/ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 equity futures are slightly in the red as of 5:30 a.m. Tokyo time, with strength in the Japanese yen weighing on the latter. On Tuesday, stocks in the region bounced back from the prior session’s retreat with the MSCI Asia Pacific Index inching 0.1 percent higher on relatively weak volumes. Hong Kong and Chinese equity markets were closed for holidays Tuesday.  The top event on the Asia Pacific economic calendar on Wednesday will be the release of China’s official manufacturing and non-manufacturing purchasing managers’ indexes, due out at 10 a.m. Tokyo time. The former is expected to moderate slightly to 51 in May from 51.2, suggesting the sector’s rate of growth decelerated. Data out of Japan include the preliminary reading of industrial production in April, expected to quicken to an annual increase of 6.1 percent from 3.5 percent, as well as housing starts for the month, estimated to dip to an annualized pace of 970,000. Also on deck: Australia’s private sector credit growth, forecast to moderate by a tick to 4.9 percent year-on-year in April, and South Korean business surveys on the nation’s manufacturing and non-manufacturing sectors. Meanwhile, India’s first-quarter GDP is slated for release at 9 p.m. Tokyo time, and is forecast to accelerate to an annual pace of 7.1 percent from 7 percent to end 2016. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."
2017-06-01T05:37:07.038Z,This Blockchain Bubble Might Be a Good Thing,"Elaine Ou
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-06-01/this-blockchain-bubble-might-be-a-good-thing,"Cryptocurrency enthusiasts have found a way to raise hundreds of millions of dollars without the hassle of registering with the Securities and Exchange Commission: selling digital tokens on a blockchain. Bubbly as this new market looks, it might actually serve a useful purpose. The token sales are known as ICOs, or Initial Coin Offerings. Digital tokens are transferable assets that can be redeemed for future goods and services, just like Amazon gift cards or Chuck E. Cheese tokens. But in this case, the token peddler hasn’t built anything yet, and plans to use the acquired funds to create the proposed service. This crowdfunding model is similar to Kickstarter, with the added benefit of immediate liquidity and global access. Andreessen-Horowitz partner Balaji Srinivasan calls token sales “Kickstarter on Steroids.” Given all the recent hype, they look more like Kickstarter on crack. At a conference last week called the Token Summit, panelists boasted that early-stage blockchain projects have raised more than $150 million since January, an amount that makes venture capital investments look like a stingy tip jar. Last month, a prediction market called Gnosis raised $12.5 million worth of ether -- a sort of analog to bitcoin -- in an ICO that floated 5 percent of its total tokens. The market price of ether has since grown eightfold, which in a way gives Gnosis an implied valuation of about $2 billion. On Wednesday, a blockchain-based advertising company called Brave raised $35 million worth of ether in just 30 seconds. Thousands of attempted purchasers were rejected for being just a bit too slow.  The token financing boom has two main drivers: Sky-high cryptocurrency valuations and the lack of an economic ecosystem to absorb such gains. Most of the token sales are conducted on the Ethereum blockchain, which itself was funded by a 2014 token sale using Bitcoin.
            
                
                1
            
         The initial ether tokens were acquired for an average price of less than 25 cents, but today they trade at more than $230.
            
                
                2
            
         Beyond gambling and speculation, there aren’t many popular uses for digital currency right now. A recent token offering called PonzICO promises to apply the proceeds towards buying the founder a Tesla. Token holders get nothing more than the right to vote on the color of the car, and somehow even that project collected nearly $3,000. In a more humble proposal, Albert Wenger of Union Square Ventures suggests that token funding could be used to finance digital infrastructure. The software protocols that power the internet were created decades ago, largely with the help of government funding. Today, that software is in critical need of maintenance, but no one wants to pay for a public good. Internet pioneers recognized that widespread adoption could take place only if software was free, in the sense of both free beer and free speech. This open-source movement created software libraries where developers have the freedom to view, modify and distribute source code without cost. Some of the most important pieces of today’s digital world are derived from open-source building blocks: Android uses the Linux kernel, Mac OS employs parts of FreeBSD, and OpenSSL encrypts all our email and web pages. It seems that there ought to be a way to extract a profit from contributions used by so many, but giving away free software is rarely a good business model. Decentralized projects are necessarily free and open if they are to have any hope of adoption, so digital tokens may turn out to be a similarly poor investment. Nevertheless, even financial sinkholes can benefit the ecosystem: Just look at all the bandwidth that the late-1990s tech boom built. All the buyers of tokens probably aren’t doing it for charity. Some see it as a way to get in on the next Uber. The token’s most attractive feature is its distinctness from the underlying transaction. Colorful casino chips make gambling feel like a game. A child dropping Chuck E. Cheese tokens into a skee-ball arcade doesn’t elicit the same concern as a kid feeding buckets of quarters into a slot machine. It could be that the real value of a blockchain token is to preserve the illusion of gambling while actually financing a public good.

2017-05-31T14:04:12.098Z,Silk Road's `Dread Pirate' Loses Appeal Over Life Sentence,"Bob Van Voris
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/silk-road-s-ross-ulbricht-must-serve-life-sentence-court-says,"The former Eagle Scout known as Dread Pirate Roberts must serve a life sentence for running the multimillion-dollar Silk Road online drug bazaar, a federal appeals court said even as it questioned the usefulness of such harsh penalties. Ross William Ulbricht, who was found guilty of operating a site where people anonymously used bitcoins to buy drugs, hacking tools and fake identification, lost his appeal of his conviction and sentence on Wednesday. He was convicted by a jury in February 2015 of seven criminal counts including conspiracy and drug trafficking, in a case that exposed the criminal potential of the Internet’s vast underbelly. A three-judge panel of the Manhattan-based appeals court rejected Ulbricht’s claims that the government illegally obtained evidence without a warrant and that his trial wasn’t fair because he couldn’t tell jurors about two former federal agents who stole money from online accounts while investigating Silk Road. The panel also showed empathy for his claim that the sentence is too harsh, but said that it must follow the laws as passed by Congress. “People may and do disagree about the social utility of harsh sentences for the distribution of controlled substances,” Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote in a 139-page opinion. “It is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes.” At this point though, the existing laws must be enforced, the judge said. “The democratically elected representatives of the people have opted for a policy of prohibition, backed by severe punishment,” Lynch wrote. Silk Road Mastermind Handed Life in Prison for Drug Bazaar Because parole was eliminated from the federal system in 1987, a life sentence leaves Ulbricht with little hope he’ll ever leave prison. As to Ulbricht’s other claims, the panel ruled that agents were permitted to monitor Internet Protocol address traffic to his home router and computers without a warrant and that the agents’ misconduct was irrelevant. ""The agents’ corruption has nothing to do with whether Ulbricht operated the site as Dread Pirate Roberts,"" Lynch wrote. ""Ulbricht has not raised any credible doubts about the reliability of the evidence that the government presented at trial, nor has he explained why the agents’ illegal actions relate to his guilt."" The former agents, from the Drug Enforcement Administration and Secret Service, pleaded guilty and were sentenced to prison. Ulbricht, 33, has been serving his sentence at a federal lockup in Manhattan. His lawyer, Joshua Dratel, declined to comment on the appeals court’s ruling. At Ulbricht’s sentencing, prosecutors warned that Silk Road had been used as a blueprint for other online criminals. Defense lawyers, parents and friends painted Ulbricht as an idealistic, naive young man who set up the online marketplace and quickly found himself in over his head. Ulbricht admitted he founded Silk Road, but said he later turned the site over to others who developed it into a criminal enterprise, a defense that was rejected by jurors and by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest in sentencing Ulbricht. “It was a carefully planned life’s work,” Forrest said at his sentencing. “You wanted it to be your legacy. And it is.” Ulbricht’s online name was taken from the ""The Princess Bride."" In the film, released in 1987, Dread Pirate Roberts is used by a series of captains who pass the title to their successor when they retire. Prosecutors said Ulbricht used the name to deflect suspicion from himself. Forrest considered evidence that Ulbricht paid $650,000 to try to arrange the murders of five people who threatened Silk Road’s anonymity. Forrest said there was “ample and unambiguous evidence” of the plots, though both prosecutors and the defense agreed no murders were carried out. Prosecutors also presented Forrest with evidence of six Silk Road users whose deaths were related to drug use. More: The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Drug Dealers Silk Road operated on the Tor network, which allows users to access sites anonymously. The use of bitcoins also helped shield the identity of suppliers and purchasers as well as Ulbricht and Silk Road employees, who used pseudonyms online. When the U.S. government shut the site down in October 2013, there were 13,802 listings for illegal drugs including LSD, cyanide, methamphetamines, cocaine, heroin, hallucinogenic mushrooms and marijuana. Users bought about $183 million worth of drugs and other illegal items on the site from 2011 to 2013, according to the government. The case is U.S. v. Ulbricht, 15-1815, Second U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals (Manhattan)."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-31/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here Pound hit by polls, euro-area inflation slows more than expected, and China growth is robust despite the deleveraging campaign. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. The pound fell to the lowest level in more than five weeks after a projection by Yougov Plc, a U.K. polling company, showed that Theresa May's Conservative Party may fall short of winning a majority in Parliament in the June 8 election. The projection, which is based on a new methodology, is out of step with other polls that continue to show a solid Conservative lead. It does, however, have people more seriously addressing the question of what it would take for Labour's Jeremy Corbyn to win the election.  Euro-area inflation slowed to 1.4 percent in May, slightly below economist expectations, and the weakest reading this year. Core inflation dropped to 0.9 percent. The numbers are likely to aid ECB President Mario Draghi's call for continued accommodative monetary policy ahead of next week's governing council meeting. Meanwhile, unemployment data for the common-currency zone showed a drop to 9.3 percent, the lowest level since March 2009. Official manufacturing data released overnight showed that growth in China is holding up, despite worries that a leverage crackdown would feed through to investment in the world's second-largest economy. The Shanghai Composite Index rose 0.2 percent, paring its monthly loss to 1.2 percent. One place that the deleveraging campaign is apparent, however, is in the government bond market, with the nation's 10-year security falling for the second month in a row.  Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific Index was little changed, while Japan's Topix index slipped 0.3 percent with energy companies leading the losses. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was unchanged at 5:48 a.m. Eastern Time, with London's FTSE 100 Index gaining on the back of the drop in the pound. S&P 500 futures were also unchanged.  It is a fairly light day for U.S. data today, with Chicago PMI due at 9:45 a.m. and pending home sales at 10:00 a.m. It will be worth keeping an eye on Brazil, where the central bank is expected to cut the main Selic rate by 100 basis points. Also due today is a European Commission report into the future of the monetary union, which may suggest the need to issue collective bonds.  This is what's caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

""We will definitely be profitable before the end of the year,"" McAfee said in a phone interview Wednesday. ""From bitcoin mining, we will get the experience and expertise to apply the blockchain to our security products."" MGT Capital announced plans last June for the first phase of its bitcoin operation, which was the company’s only revenue driver in the first quarter. It’s stationed in the mountains of Washington state and employs two people, whose primary job is to maintain the air conditioning system for the computers that are doing the mining, McAfee said. MGT Capital has a dozen employees. The bitcoin venture generated $312,000 in sales for the three months ended March 31, 2017, according to a government filing. The company had a net loss of $5.89 million. MGT Capital said Monday that it received financing to buy 1,000 mining computers from Chinese firm Bitmain Technologies, bringing the total to around 1,300. It expects to start generating 225 bitcoins per month, up from about 100, which was the most recently disclosed number. The cryptocurrency is currently worth about $2,700 per coin. Skeptics have warned that there’s a bubble in the making. Bitcoin and other digital currencies like ethereum have surged as more companies embrace the underlying technology and some investors seek financial refuge from political uncertainty across the globe. MGT Capital primarily mines bitcoin, but also has small-scale operations for ethereum and monero, McAfee said. Read more about the surge in bitcoin and other alternative currencies ""No matter how much government and regulators may scream and complain, there will be a world standard alternative currency,"" McAfee said. ""Bitcoin appears to be the one... It cannot possibly be a bubble."" Bitcoin transactions are overseen by a network of so-called miners whose computers perform calculations to validate each transfer, preventing double-spending. Miners earn a reward of newly issued bitcoin. The pace of creation is limited, and no more than 21 million bitcoins will ever be issued. MGT Capital grabbed investors’ attention last year after naming McAfee CEO. The news sent its shares into a frenzy, but the euphoria quickly faded after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission subpoenaed the company and the stock was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The company is now embroiled in a lawsuit with Intel Corp. over the use of the McAfee moniker. Intel bought the McAfee computer-security business in 2011, but recently sold its majority stake. McAfee, who wants to change MGT Capital’s name to John McAfee Global Technologies, sued Intel for the right to use his name. Shares of MGT Capital surged as much as 63 percent Thursday to $1.14 in over-the-counter trading.  MGT Capital employees who aren’t working on bitcoin are focused on the cybersecurity business, which McAfee anticipates will ultimately be the main revenue source as it expands product offerings, and the number of bitcoins left for mining dwindles. The company’s Sentinel ""anti-hacking system,"" which consists of software and hardware, can reduce the time a hacker has to operate, according to its website. MGT Capital is also developing a ""privacy phone"" that features a kill switch. ""I don’t know anyone more capable than me,"" said McAfee. ""I have never lost in terms of business and I certainly don’t intend to start now."""
2017-05-31T20:30:06.767Z,The Daily Prophet: Oil Is Complicating Lots of Popular Trades,"Robert Burgess
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-31/the-daily-prophet-oil-is-complicating-lots-of-popular-trades,"The roller coaster that is otherwise known as the oil market is heading lower -- again -- and dragging down almost everything associated with the energy complex. Wednesday’s weakness was based on a familiar theme: doubts that prolonged cuts by OPEC and its allies will succeed in clearing a surplus while U.S. output remains so resilient.Even though Saudi Arabia’s Energy Minister Khalid Al-Falih said the cuts are working and predicted global inventories will fall to the five-year average in early 2018, American drillers continue to add rigs to shale fields, according to Bloomberg News’ Meenal Vamburkar. “There doesn’t seem to be an end to supply out there,” said Bob Yawger, director of the futures division at Mizuho Securities USA. “And demand is not exactly rip-roaring.” American drillers last week boosted the number of active rigs to 722, the most since April 2015, according to data from Baker Hughes.  To the strategists at JPMorgan, the gyrations in the price have wide implications. The broad range of $40 to $60 a barrel that the market is stuck in is depressed enough in terms of average prices and wide enough “to complicate” a number of key trades that investors have piled into that are dependent on faster inflation. Those include shorting bonds, owning debt securities that protect against rising consumer prices, and betting on the currencies of some commodity-dependent economies over the next year. Energy stocks are the worst-performing sector in the MSCI All-Country World Index this year, falling 8.39 percent on average.HOW THE MIGHTY HAVE FALLENDespite a seventh straight month of gains for the global stock market, May ended with a bit of a whimper. Equities fell as financial stocks faltered on news from JPMorgan and Bank of America, the two biggest U.S. banks, that second-quarter trading revenue is on pace to drop at least 10 percent because tranquil markets are curbing demand, according to Bloomberg News’ Hugh Son and Dakin Campbell. Even before the latest revelations, financial shares were under pressure as a rally in longer-term bonds caused the difference between short- and long-term borrowing cost to shrink, raising concern about the health of banks’ net interest margins. One proxy of financial shares, the PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio exchange-traded fund, dropped 2.80 in May, bringing its loss since the end of February to 7.40 percent. Financial shares had soared in the prior four months, leading markets higher on the prospect that the Trump administration would loosen restrictive bank regulations. The PowerShares KBW Bank Portfolio ETF soared 29 percent between the end of October and the end of February. PIMCO IS DOING LOTS OF HAND-WRINGINGIn fact, most of the Trump administration’s pro-growth policies are in doubt, from tax reform to infrastructure spending -- at least for this year. Pacific Investment Management Co. was out with a report Wednesday saying that investors have become too complacent and that monetary, fiscal, trade and geopolitical risks abound. As they see it, there’s a 70 percent chance of a recession in the next five years, according to Bloomberg News’ John Gittelsohn. “We believe that many market participants today are too relaxed, that medium-term risks are building and that investors should consider using cyclical rallies to build cash to deploy when markets eventually correct -- and possibly overshoot -- as risks are repriced,” the firm said in its annual “Secular Outlook” for the next three to five years. Of concern to Pimco is that policy makers are “driving without a spare tire” because of limited tools -- caused by big balance sheets and low or negative interest rates -- to deal with a recession. GOLD BUGS ABOUNDGiven the worrying over at Pimco, perhaps it’s not surprising that hedge funds are jumping back into gold at the fastest pace since 2007. Money managers boosted their long positions in U.S. futures by the most in almost a decade in the week ended May 23, Commodity Futures Trading Commission data show. Bullion futures have posted three straight weekly gains, helped by U.S. and European political angst that has boosted demand for the metal as a haven, according to Bloomberg News’ Joe Richter. Those bets have paid off with gold advancing Wednesday to its highest since April 25, or $1,276.80 per ounce. According to strategists at BMO Capital Markets, the Federal Reserve’s monthly Beige Book economic report struck a dovish tone on the economy, offered a divergence from the “all is well"" mantra as optimism waned in some districts, namely Boston, Chicago and New York. Is it too late to buy some gold? CHINA TAKES ON CURRENCY SPECULATORSForeign-exchange traders and strategists alike are (re)learning a tough lesson: Don’t bet against the yuan. The currency has jumped to its highest level in seven months offshore, soaring as much as 1.1 percent on Wednesday alone, despite analyst forecasts for declines this quarter. Surging interbank rates are squeezing bears by driving up the cost of short positions, according to Bloomberg News’ Helen Sun, Molly Wei and Emma Dai. The rally, which broke months of calm against the dollar, came on the heels of an unwelcome credit-rating downgrade from Moody’s. China made its displeasure clear, calling the move “absolutely groundless.” The central bank had already been battling pessimistic traders by repeatedly strengthening the daily fixing. “The Moody’s downgrade and a weaker spot rate compared to the fixing could have spurred the authorities to change the fixing mechanism and potentially intervene in the market,” said Jason Daw, Singapore-based head of emerging-market currency strategy at Societe Generale. EMERGING-MARKET STOCKS FACE NEW ERAThe stock markets of the world’s developing economies are about to undergo a bit of a revolution. As the index provider MSCI prepares to carry out its annual review in June, some of the world’s biggest markets -- with assets totaling almost $9 trillion -- are poised for reclassification, according to Bloomberg News’ Srinivasan Sivabalan. Perhaps the most notable are China and Saudi Arabia. China’s domestic equities were denied entry into MSCI’s benchmark indexes for a third year last June despite measures to address such concerns as repatriation limits and excessive trading suspensions. Only 169 mainland-listed companies will be considered for inclusion, down from 448 under a previous proposal, and all will be large-cap shares currently accessible to foreign investors through exchange links with Hong Kong. Two years after Saudi Arabia opened its stock market to global investors, foreign ownership has languished at about 5 percent and the equity index has lost about 30 percent. The market’s size fell by about $140 billion as the changes coincided with the government’s austerity measures. The country says its bourse has met all the criteria laid out by MSCI for inclusion. TEA LEAVESAfter Wednesday’s rather downbeat Beige Book, the monthly manufacturing report from the Institute for Supply Management will surely get extra attention. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News is for a reading of 54.6 for May, little changed from 54.8 in April. Recall that the weaker-than-expected result in April left the index essentially back at December’s levels that, according to the economists at Bloomberg Intelligence, may have been due to less optimism among manufacturers in the Trump administration’s capacity to deliver on a pro-manufacturing policy agenda. The BI economists say they will be paying attention to export orders, with any signs of resilience signaling a firming in external demand, which could provide a modest tailwind to growth.

The cryptocurrency extended its surge by 10 percent to a record-high $2,690 on Thursday, bringing gains this year to 182 percent, after an agreement to upgrade the speed of processing transactions.  Before the pact, which was revealed on Tuesday, the digital currency faced a swelling backlog of transactions due to a cap on the amount of data the bitcoin blockchain can process. Disagreements over the right solution had fueled fears the digital asset would be split into two. This week, Barry Silbert, founder of Digital Currency Group, posted a pact signed by more than 50 companies on increasing the block size and activating Segregated Witness, a new way of verifying transactions.  “It’s pretty significant to put this forward, have a consensus and move forward with a solution,” said Ryan Rabaglia, head trader at Octagon Strategy Ltd., a digital-currency trading firm in Hong Kong. “It’s always been on the back burner as something that can potentially disrupt bitcoin’s growth.” While the signatories represent 83 percent of bitcoin hashing power, many similar agreements have fallen through in the past, including one that was supposed to be activated in July this year. SegWit, which was released last year, has also drawn ire from some corners of the bitcoin community. “The whole industry is a bit immature in ways,” Rabaglia said. — With assistance by Yuji Nakamura"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-29/europe-s-biggest-utilities-join-blockchain-energy-trading-trial,"Some of Europe’s biggest utilities joined a project to test blockchain-based trades in wholesale power and natural gas markets.  Utilities from Enel SpA to RWE AG will start live trading based on blockchain in the fourth quarter, after tests that start in August, said Michael Merz, managing director at Ponton GmbH, the developer of the project. The software, called Enerchain, allows anonymous peer-to-peer trading without using a third party. Blockchain, the technology at the heart of bitcoin, may help the energy business to adapt to a more decentralized world with intermittent solar and wind power output. The technology is being tested by utilities from Vattenfall AB to grid companies such as Tennet Holding BV in areas from consumer electricity platforms to managing the network. ""Some utilities are taking part because they just want to test how blockchain works, others really want to find out whether it will pay off to use it in trading,"" Merz said by phone from Hamburg. For more on blockchain and bitcoins read a QuickTake here. Enerchain allows traders to anonymously send orders to a decentralized orderbook that can be accessed by other traders, according to a statement Monday. This may lower transaction costs by erasing the need for exchanges or brokers. The participating 23 utilities paid 20,000 euros ($22,000) to fund the final development of the project and aim to test trades in spot as well as forward power and gas contracts in different regions, Merz said. Other members include Vattenfall, Total SA and Iberdrola SA. Ponton isn’t alone in aiming to apply blockchain to wholesale energy trading. Vienna-based startup Grid Singularity is also working on a decentralized digital platform to sell and buy energy."

The market capitalization of digital currencies has soared over 50 percent to more than $90 billion in the past seven days as the frenzy around cryptocurrencies reaches a fever pitch.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-25/kik-messenger-app-debuts-own-digital-currency-amid-bitcoin-boom,"Messaging app Kik Interactive is the latest and potentially most well-established company to delve into a quirky new form of fundraising -- creating its own digital currency. Kik, based in Waterloo, Canada, unveiled plans for an “initial coin offering,” a process by which it sells tokens that can be used to buy services on its platform. The idea is that as more and more people use Kik, the value of those tokens, called “Kin”, will rise in value. Interest in coin offerings is high, thanks to surging prices of bitcoin and other virtual currencies. Called ICOs, they give a wide range of people the chance to invest in a company or any other endeavor early on. While unregulated, they have proved popular, with investors spending around $330 million on tokens over the past year, according to data compiled by cryptocurrency blog The Control. Earlier this month, cloud-storage startup Storj raised almost $30 million in five days via an ICO. Kik, which has raised about $120 million (in real money) from investors including Tencent Holdings Ltd., could serve to add a new layer of legitimacy to the process. “Kik will be the largest install base of cryptocurrency users in the world,” Chief Executive Officer Ted Livingston said. “Kin, on day one will be the most-used cryptocurrency in the world.” The move comes as Kik finally reveals how many people actually use its app regularly each month: 15 million. That’s a far-cry from the 300 million total registered users number it was sharing around this time last year. Kik has traditionally been most popular among teens because, unlike Facebook Inc.’s Messenger or WhatsApp, they don’t need a phone number to use it. Growth has been tough in the past few years though, as teenagers get smartphones earlier and Kik users switch to Facebook apps once they leave high school. Kik plans to gift a certain amount of Kin to each user. They’ll be able use the new currency to buy games, live video streams and other digital products. The company’s goal is to attract new merchants to sell on the platform, creating a snowball effect where Kin becomes more valuable and more sellers pile onto Kik, increasing its popularity. “We will create an economy where millions and millions of mainstream consumers are earning in a cryptocurrency for the first time ever,’’ Livingston said. “They’re going to want to spend in that same cryptocurrency as well.’’"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-23/bitcoin-executives-say-digital-currency-rotation-driving-surge,"Bitcoin’s dramatic surge may be more than just a speculative frenzy. The recent rally is being driven partially by enthusiasts rotating out of riskier digital assets and into the more established cryptocurrency, according to industry executives. ""A lot of the volume into bitcoin right now is actually not dollar or yen or euro into bitcoin, but is rather alt digital assets,"" said Peter Smith, co-founder and CEO of digital asset software platform Blockchain, at an industry conference Tuesday that brought in 2,700 people on the first day. “People do view a lot of these newer assets as more risky, and so when they make big gains there, they’re selling down those gains and rotating into bitcoin."" Numerous alternative cryptocurrencies, or ""altcoins"" such as ripple, have emerged since bitcoin broke into public consciousness in 2013. Companies can sell new tokens through initial coin offerings, or ICOs. While the cost of one bitcoin has skyrocketed to more than $2,000 from just 8 cents in 2010, you can buy one litecoin for about $30. The price of ether, the cryptocurrency tied to the Ethereum blockchain, has almost doubled in the last week. Some are worried that there’s a bitcoin bubble in the making, but Smith and Erik Voorhees, founder and chief executive officer of cryptocurrency exchange ShapeShift, aren’t too concerned. Booms and busts are a normal part of any economic cycle, they said at the Consensus 2017 conference. ""Every time bitcoin goes through these bubbles, a whole new wave of users come in,"" Voorhees said. ""The reason that bitcoin is taking off is because banks have not been innovating."" Read more on Fidelity’s Abby Johnson’s view on blockchain barriers The surge has also been tied to global political uncertainty and increased interest in Asia. Chinese stocks have slumped in recent months as bitcoin soared. The Shanghai Composite Index has fallen 6.9 percent from its high this year on April 11 amid concern authorities will step up measures to crack down on leveraged trading. China also may publish bitcoin regulations in June, according to a report earlier this month. ""Bitcoin up 100% in under 2 months. Shanghai down almost 10% same timeframe, compared to most global stocks up. Probably not a coincidence!"" Doubleline Capital CEO Jeff Gundlach wrote in a tweet Tuesday. ShapeShift users, only about 15 percent of whom are in the U.S., are moving small amounts of value between different digital tokens as they speculate about the best place to put their money, Voorhees said. Bitcoin is the ""least speculative"" of the digital assets, he explained. Smith’s company, which added former Barclays Plc CEO Antony Jenkins as a board member last year, has grown every year regardless of bitcoin’s price, he said. ""One of the beautiful things about bitcoin is you get to see free-market economics at work every day, and bubbles and creative destruction are part of that process,"" added Smith, who said people have been incorrectly writing bitcoin’s obituary as it goes through natural up and down cycles. ""I’m sure we’ll add a lot of obituaries if the market reverses and we go down below $2,000."" — With assistance by Belinda Cao, and Lee Spears"
2017-05-23T20:30:11.841Z,"The Daily Prophet: Bitcoin Goes Vertical, Wall Street Harrumphs","Robert Burgess
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-23/the-daily-prophet-bitcoin-goes-vertical-wall-street-harrumphs,"Forget Donald Trump or the Federal Reserve. It seems the only thing Wall Streeters want to discuss is the meteoric rise in the price of bitcoin -- and not in a good way. The crypto-currency has soared above $2,200, more than doubling since late March. In fact, if you were lucky enough to buy $1,000 worth of bitcoins in 2010, you'd have $36.7 million today. Even with that jaw-dropping performance, bitcoin is struggling to gain any respect. Brown Brothers Harriman came out with a report today eviscerating bitcoin and other crypto-currencies, saying they are currencies in name only because they contain a fundamental contradiction. According to the firm, if they’re a supposed to be an alternative to fiat currencies, they should be hoarded as a store of value. But if they’re hoarded, they can’t develop the critical mass of networking needed to fulfill the other functions of money, such as a means of exchange. Their volatility also means they're not a good store of value. Whereas bitcoin often moves 2 percent to 3 percent or more per day, the dollar usually doesn’t move more than 1 percent. To the extent that some retailers accept them is a bit of a novelty and marketing fluke, not confirmation of its currency status.     ""These are not currencies in any meaningful sense,"" Brown Brothers strategists led by March Chandler wrote in the report. ""They are currencies to the extent that contacts on Facebook are friends and the 'grande' means medium size at Starbucks."" About 16.3 million bitcoins exist, with about 1,800 new ones created, or mined, per day. That puts the size of the market at about $36 billion, versus the $5.1 trillion that typically trades daily in the traditional foreign-exchange market. Reasons for the rally vary, but include a decision by Japan last month to recognize bitcoin as a legal payment method as well as enthusiasts rotating out of riskier digital assets and into the more established crypto-currency along with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to review a ruling it made in March 10 that blocked a proposal for a bitcoin ETF.STOCKS RALLY AS 'OVERSHOOT' BECOMES A REAL RISKIt wasn't pretty, but U.S. stocks managed to eke out a small, 0.18 percent gain to stage their longest rally since February. The S&P 500 Index has risen for four straight sessions, the most since it gained six consecutive days between Feb. 7 and Feb. 15. With a strong earnings season now behind them, investors are wondering what will be the catalyst to keep pushing stocks higher. In one ominous sign, the biggest exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 Index lost $16.2 billion in outflows over the last seven weeks, the largest drawdown for a period that long going back two years, according to Bloomberg News' Oliver Renick. Michael Hartnett, the chief investment strategist at Bank of America’s Merrill Lynch unit, figures stocks are poised for a “speculative overshoot.” Hartnett cited a ratio between the MSCI USA Growth Index, dominated by technology stocks, and the MSCI World Value Index of developed markets as an indicator, according to Bloomberg News' David Wilson. The ratio surpassed its March 2000 peak and set a record within the past month. WILL THE REAL BOND MARKET PLEASE STAND UP?The bond market is sending some very mixed signals these days. A weekly JPMorgan Chase survey of fixed-income clients showed they are net bearish by the most since the start of 2017. Yet, the Treasury Department's auction of $26 billion in two-year notes drew the most demand in a year despite the consensus that minutes of the Federal Reserve's last meeting to be released Wednesday will bolster speculation that policy makers will raise rates again next month. Investors put in bids for 2.9 times the amount offered. Indirect bidders -- a class that includes pension funds and mutual funds -- bought 57.2 percent, higher than the 42.6 percent average at the previous 10 auctions. This week's auctions of coupon-bearing notes continue Wednesday with the sale of $34 billion in five-year notes before wrapping up Thursday's $28 billion offering of seven-year notes. BULLISH BETS BUILD ON NATURAL GASThe market for U.S. natural gas may be about to break out of a rut, if hedge funds are to be believed. Hedge funds are the most bullish on gas since 2014, when prices rocketed to $4 per million British thermal units after a frigid winter depleted stockpiles of the heating and power-plant fuel, according to Bloomberg News' Naureen S. Malik. Money managers are betting that forecasts for one of the hottest summers on record will pan out, straining supplies as exports rise and production from shale basins stages a slow recovery. “People are incredibly bullish about the summer overall, that we are going to see a ton of demand and that it’s going to be a hot one,” John Kilduff, partner at Again Capital LLC in New York, said by phone May 9. “$4 is definitely possible in the July and August time period.” Gas futures for June delivery fell 3.3 percent to $3.219 per million British thermal units on the New York Mercantile Exchange, making  worst performer in the Bloomberg Commodity Index after sugar.  CHINA BATTLES CURRENCY TRADERSThere's a tug-of-war happening with the yuan that illustrates the tension at the heart of China’s currency market. Almost every day, China’s central bank pushes up the yuan and traders push it down. Officials have used the daily fixing to guide the currency higher against the dollar for eight of the past nine days, surprising market watchers with its strength. That’s failed to inspire confidence in the yuan, which has closed lower than the reference rate on all but one of those days, according to Bloomberg News' Emma Dai and Tian Chen. As a campaign to cut risk in the financial sector weighs on the nation’s bonds and stocks, the authorities are keen to maintain stability in the yuan -- as expressed through the stronger-than-expected fixings -- and limit outflows. Yet, with the deleveraging campaign showing little sign of ending, and an economic rebound looking shaky, traders see a weaker outlook for a currency that’s still slumping against peers outside the dollar. TEA LEAVESThe big event Wednesday will be the release of the minutes from the Fed's May 2-3 meeting. The release of the May post-meeting statement was a relative non-event, as the decision to hold interest rates unchanged was unanimous and the economic assessment was straightforward -- attributing first-quarter economic weakness to transitory factors, according to Bloomberg Intelligence economists. Given the stable outlook at the time of the meeting, officials likely had extra time to evaluate scenarios to start reducing the central bank's $4.47 trillion balance-sheet, the BI economists conclude. The minutes are likely to reveal the results of additional staff analysis, as well as signal the evolution of officials' inclinations toward the timing and speed of any reduction.

OPEC extension is a ""sell the news"" event, bitcoin keeps surging, and a fresh record for U.S. stocks. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. As expected, OPEC and other major oil producers reached an agreement to extend their production curbs through March 2018 in a bid to normalize global inventories. West Texas Intermediate futures, which had been rallying in recent weeks in anticipation of a deal, sold off hard, slumping below $49 per barrel as of 5:30 a.m. Tokyo time.

The U.S. dollar was the best-performing G10 currency on Thursday, with 10-year Treasury yields also rising modestly. Despite growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will follow through on its tightening plans for 2017, Wall Street sees U.S. government borrowing costs staying subdued. S&P/ASX 200 and Nikkei 225 equity futures were little changed as of 5:30 a.m. Tokyo time, with the former marginally in the red and the latter slightly higher. The MSCI Asia Pacific Index ended its losing streak at two on Thursday with South Korean and Chinese equities leading the way higher. The outperformance of financial shares on the Shanghai Composite Index fueled rumors that state-backed funds helped fuel that market's gains. The headline event on the Asia Pacific economic calendar on Friday will be the release of Japanese inflation data at 8:30 a.m. National headline and core inflation are expected to pick up to 0.4 percent in April from 0.2 percent. Likewise, May's reading of headline and core inflation in Tokyo is forecast to come in flat on an annual basis from a 0.1 percent year-on-year retreat in the prior reading. Also due out: the final reading of Taiwan's first-quarter GDP growth and April's reading of industrial production in Singapore. South Korean consumer confidence rose to 108 in May from 101.2. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-22/peach-becomes-japan-s-first-airline-to-accept-payment-in-bitcoin,"Peach Aviation Ltd. will become the first Japanese carrier to accept bitcoin as payment for airline tickets as the discount airline aims to attract more tourists from other parts of Asia. The cryptocurrency can be used to book seats starting by the end of the year, Peach said in a statement in Tokyo Monday, adding a change in Japan’s law on fund settlements in April helped facilitate the move. The carrier also aims to increase tie-ups with local governments and regional companies to help spread usage of the currency, it said. “We want to encourage visitors from overseas and the revitalization of Japan’s regions,” Shinichi Inoue, chief executive officer of Peach told reporters in Tokyo Monday. “This is a real first step in partnerships for Japan and we are aiming for more company and service tie-ups.” Bitcoin is surging in popularity as the digital payment system that allows users anywhere in the world to transact directly without interference from intermediaries, governments, regulators or central banks. Latvian airline airBaltic announced almost three years ago that it would start accepting payment using bitcoin as it focuses on the customer. The electronic currency surged as much as 13 percent to a record $2,187.78 on Monday, and is trading about 70 percent above the price of an ounce of gold, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. It has more than doubled its value since the beginning of the year amid global political uncertainty and increased interest in Asia. Skeptics have said that there may be a bubble in the making, as bitcoin has repeatedly broken records without showing signs of slowing. Universal Air Travel Plan teamed up with Bitnet as a payment processing partner more than two years ago to allow it to offer the ability to accept bitcoin payments in a simplified manner to its network of more than 260 airlines, according to a statement from UATP."
2017-05-26T13:07:21.248Z,VIX Hedging and College Sports,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-26/vix-hedging-and-college-sports,"VIX manipulation?! We talked on Wednesday about the CBOE Volatility Index, the VIX, which is an index of implied volatility based on S&P 500 Index stock options. The VIX is used as the reference for VIX futures and options, and we discussed a paper by John Griffin and Amin Shams of the University of Texas arguing that a monthly auction for the S&P 500 options is manipulated to influence the price of the VIX and the settlement prices of VIX derivatives. One thing that I said on Wednesday is that VIX derivatives are all cash settled: ""The VIX is not a thing you can own, so if your option ends up in the money you just get paid cash for the value of the VIX at settlement."" That's mostly true -- they are cash settled -- but in a sense the VIX is a thing you can own. The VIX is calculated based on the prices of a strip of underlying S&P 500 options, so you could ""own"" the VIX by buying those options. (This is very loose -- the options, unlike the VIX, are not pure volatility products, and you'd want to hedge their S&P price exposure -- but it's a useful abstraction.) And you could even imagine a VIX derivative that was physically settled instead of cash settled: If you bought a VIX future with a price of 12, then at maturity you'd deliver $12 and your counterparty would deliver the underlying S&P 500 options. Which would be worth $13 if the VIX was at 13, or $11 if it was at 11, etc. (Not really -- they'd be worth $13 or $11 of vega -- but, again, abstraction.) This is like how, say, oil futures notionally work: You buy an oil future, so you have exposure to oil, and then it expires, but you still have exposure to oil, because you have received a delivery of oil. Again, that product doesn't exist for the VIX. But you can create it! Let's say you own VIX futures for some reason -- as an outright bet on volatility, or a hedge to some other trade. When your futures expire, they will pay you cash. But you might not want cash: You wanted volatility exposure yesterday, and you might want the same exposure tomorrow, for the same reason. So when the futures settle in cash, you can just use the cash to buy the options. If you bought a VIX future with a price of 12, and at maturity the VIX is 13, you'd get the $13 in cash and spend it on buying the underlying S&P 500 options that make up the VIX. And then the day after settlement, you would sort of have the same exposure -- the exposure to S&P 500 volatility as measured by the VIX -- as you did the day before settlement. And the most seamless and efficient way to do that would be to buy that strip of options in the VIX settlement auction. That is, I think, the best innocent explanation for Griffin's and Shams's findings that people seem to trade a lot of VIX-underlying options in the VIX settlement auction. They attribute it to manipulation -- people buy underlying VIX options to push up the settlement price of the VIX -- but it may just be people rolling their positions. Pravit Chintawongvanich of Macro Risk Advisors points out in a client note: This is a general feature of derivatives markets: You are often trading in the underlying, to put on or unwind or hedge or roll derivatives positions, in ways that influence the price of your derivative. Your motivation could be to keep your risk constant, or to move the price, or both. And the person on the other side of the trade may be doing exactly offsetting hedging trades. In isolation, buying a lot of S&P options when you have a derivative referencing those options could look like manipulation, or it could be very normal hedging behavior.  Griffin and Shams consider this explanation in their paper, by the way, but they argue that, ""inconsistent with a sudden demand for such a specific SPX position, we find no volume jump on the VIX settlement day for other tightly related exchange-traded products that mimic the same payoff."" Transforming a VIX futures position into an options position is perhaps not the most intuitive way to keep your volatility exposure. Lots of traders don't take physical delivery on their oil futures either: If you have oil exposure via oil futures, and you want to keep the exposure, and the futures are expiring, it's a lot easier to just roll your position into new futures than to actually take delivery of a bunch of barrels of oil. In S&P 500 volatility, too, you might roll into new VIX futures rather than going out and buying the options. Also, it is possible that both things -- turning VIX futures into options, and also manipulation -- are going on. Quants quants quants quants. Here's a story about how Ivy League athletes are being displaced by Ivy League computer scientists in Wall Street recruiting. You shouldn't overstate that trend: For the foreseeable future, investment banks will need to hire risk-takers who work hard, are good team players, stay calm under pressure, and are fun to go out drinking with, and they will continue to look to college lacrosse teams for those characteristics. Still I am not entirely convinced by the athletes' claims: Why? I mean obviously computers think more quickly than humans do, that is the point of computers. They are also likely to be more disciplined, insofar as they have no emotions, don't get tired, will never exceed their programmed risk limits, etc. There are a whole lot of industries that die out to the sound of special pleading. ""You can't replace us, customers really want our human touch and personal insight, a machine can never do what we do,"" the last travel agents and bond traders and financial journalists will say. Meanwhile, I said yesterday that Silicon Valley is where data scientists go to work on advertising models and pretend that they're saving the world, while Wall Street is where data scientists go to work on trading models and not do that, but I missed a possibility. Data scientists can also go to Wall Street to build advertising models: Aramco. Here is a story about a beauty pageant that is related to Saudi Arabian Oil Co.'s proposed initial public offering, but it is not about the metaphorical sort of ""beauty pageant"" where bankers trek out to Saudi Arabia to pitch their credentials and try to get hired on the deal. No, it is about a literal beauty pageant, but for camels: Saudi Arabia's royal family wanted a fancy new complex to host the camel pageant, and so Saudi Aramco quickly built one at a cost of about $55 million. It does a lot of random construction projects, actually: ""Aramco was also involved in building the counter-terrorism center in Riyadh where President Donald Trump and King Salman were photographed earlier this week touching a glowing orb.""  The question, for a potential investor in Aramco's IPO, is: Do you want your company spending its money building public projects for the Saudi royal family? And how confident can you be that the company is getting a good deal? These are particularly difficult questions in that they are traditionally answered by governance rights: If a regular company goes public in the regular way, and then it spends its money on vanity projects for friends of its chief executive officer, the board can fire the CEO, or an activist can persuade shareholders to vote out the board. (Or shareholders can sue in state court for breaches of fiduciary duty.) It is hard for a company credibly to commit to a standard like ""we will act in our shareholders' interests, not our executives',"" which is why that expectation is usually enforced by shareholder voting -- and why it is sometimes not all that well enforced in companies that are controlled by one shareholder. Elsewhere in state oil companies: ""Venezuela Secretly Plotted to Sell Banned Syrian Oil to the U.S."" The oil would go through a Russian shell company because, you know, in for a penny, in for a pound. The plot seems to have been the idea of Venezuelan oil trader Wilmer Ruperti, who does not have much of a talent for codenames: ""Sirius Venezuelan""! No one would ever guess. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Here is Kin, the cryptocurrency for Kik, the chat app. I don't really understand why a chat app would need a cryptocurrency but, you know, stickers: Here is venture capitalist Fred Wilson on the idea. And Joe Weisenthal argues (on Twitter, and in the Bloomberg Markets newsletter) for a Facebook Inc. currency: Sure, why not. The default expectation for much of human history has been that currency was associated with power: If you run a state, you get to mint and control the currency in that state. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were built on the idea of dissociating currency and power: Currencies could have value because people believed in them, without any state sanction. Perhaps the currency-power linkage is more stable, but the link between power and traditional states has broken down. Maybe social media companies and chat apps have replaced nation-states as the centers of power in the modern world; maybe they should be minting currencies. Elsewhere, the Bank of Canada is not so sure that its centralized ledger keeping track of Canadian dollars should really be replaced by a blockchain: Against ""and."" ""Academic politics are so vicious because the stakes are so low,"" and here is a story of a group of economists who staged a successful revolt against their boss over the word ""and"": Paul Romer remains the chief economist, but is no longer in charge of the researchers in the Development Economics Group, apparently because he thought they were too vague and verbose. Of course the stakes at the World Bank aren't especially low, or at least they don't have to be. ""Romer expressed to those around him that the department should communicate more clearly, dive right into public debates, and align its work with the institution’s goals of ending extreme poverty and reducing inequality."" It is easier to do that if you write clearly. Here is Romer's defense/semi-apology, and here is his internal blog post about ""and"": Yeah look that's too many ""ands""! If you want your research to actually influence policy, it probably is helpful if it expresses clear conclusions and priorities, rather than listing everything that anyone might want. I don't know that cutting out ""and"" is a perfect proxy for making hard choices and focusing one's recommendations, but I see where Romer's coming from.  People are worried that people aren't worried enough. Dean Curnutt of Macro Risk Advisors worries, at Bloomberg Prophets, about complacency in the face of weird geopolitical events: ""Of all the dangers in the world of finance, the enduring low level of market volatility is the most significant."" But James Stewart argues that markets should be pretty complacent about all the political stuff: People are worried about unicorns. The New York Stock Exchange is worried that unicorns like Spotify AB that want a direct listing instead of an initial public offering will go to Nasdaq, rather than NYSE, because NYSE's rules make it harder to direct list. (""So far Nasdaq has done more direct listings of private companies, having completed about a half-dozen since 2006, while NYSE has had none."") So the NYSE has filed a rule change with the Securities and Exchange Commission -- informally called the ""Spotify rule"" -- that would allow it to direct-list companies even if their shares don't really trade in private markets, as long as their publicly-held shares are worth at least $250 million.  Elsewhere, it is not exactly a unicorn story, but here is some worrying that we are in a (public-company) technology bubble. And I am worried about this person: ""I ate nothing but Insta-worthy unicorn-themed food for an entire day - and the experience was far more miserable than magical."" Me yesterday. I wrote about a case of alleged insider trading at the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services. Also, in Money Stuff yesterday, I said that Norway's new cod-bedecked banknote is a ""200-euro note."" Of course it is a 200-kroner note. Things happen. The Highest-Paid C.E.O.s in 2016.

2017-05-24T22:00:01.001Z,The Hottest New Way of Investing in Silicon Valley Comes With a Big Catch,"Camila Russo
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-24/digital-tokens-unlock-stakes-in-blockchain-as-icos-proliferate,"It’s too late to invest in Airbnb Inc. but a company that bills itself as the Airbnb of cloud computer storage is raising cash -- and anyone with an Internet connection can get in on the action. Storj Labs Inc. is selling digital coins at 50 cents apiece to raise $30 million in an early stage financing round. In just five days, hundreds of contributors signed up for a piece of what they hope will be the next Silicon Valley unicorn. But there’s a catch -- unlike traditional venture capital investments, the tokens don’t confer a claim on Storj’s equity or future profits. Instead, the tokens’ value derives from their utility in the firm’s app, by providing access to data storage on a distributed network. They are the latest entry in the growing ledger of cryptocurrencies, digital coins that unlock myriad apps across the computing world. The coins are tradable on dozens of online exchanges and demand for all sorts of them has exploded as people speculate on the next big tech startup. “The average investor is missing out on the Ubers and AirBnbs of the world,” said Bart Stephens, a managing partner at Blockchain Capital, a VC firm that’s invested in blockchain-related startups since 2012. “If the next Uber decides to issue tokens, that would be an opportunity for more investors to get access to the most exciting technologies out there.” The Storj sale is known as an initial coin offering, a model of finance spreading across the tech sector. Investors spent $332 million on tokens in the past year, more than double what VCs handed over in seed rounds, according to data compiled by coin-focused blog The Control. The haul is slated to hit $600 million in 2017, it says, adding to a market for tokens that’s nearly tripled in the past year. ICOs are possible thanks to blockchain, the catchall term for a digital ledger that promises incorruptible storage of financial transactions. Banks and stock exchanges have spent millions on it, looking for ways to cut the costs for transferring money or recording equity sales. One of the latest to back the technology was the chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments, Abigail Johnson. Most famously, it’s the technology that underpins bitcoin -- just as it does for every token offered in an ICO. Their massive increase in popularity has more than a few detractors warning of a bubble, worried that the allure of finding the next tech lottery ticket is fueling rampant speculation. The concern is particularly acute at a time when investors are fretting about stretched valuations for tech startups, with the likes of Uber commanding multibillion-dollar price tags even as they burn through cash. Take Gnosis, a prediction market application based on the Ethereum blockchain that raised $12.5 million in 12 minutes on April 24, resulting in a market cap of almost $300 million. It’s generated no revenue and has little more than a white paper describing what it intends to do. Yet its tokens, which would allow users to bet on things such as election outcomes, soared eightfold in the three weeks since May 2, giving it a valuation of over $2 billion -- more than the average Russell 2000 Index stock. Gnosis’s runup is just part of the craze that’s gripped the cryptocurrency market in the last month, with the price of a bitcoin surging over 30 percent in the past week alone to more than $2,500. That’s pushed the market capitalization of digital currencies over 50 percent higher to more than $90 billion. Even after that surge, the market is still relatively small, though it’s taking steps toward maturity as the ICO boom spreads. There are platforms to track historical prices and volume, and reports on individual issuances to help prospective buyers assess a firm’s prospects. The offerings happen outside the purview of regulators -- quite by design -- as technically, the coins are part of the app and not securities. ICOs don’t have disclosure requirements, and the issuer can accept an unlimited number of U.S. investors, instead of the 99 vetted investors limited to traditional VC funding rounds. The space has also been a breeding ground for scams, and some coins have turned out to be vulnerable to attacks. Hackers were able to steal $50 million from a fund called Decentralized Autonomous Organization after it raised $150 million in the biggest issuance ever in April 2016. For entrepreneurs, the appeal is obvious. A white paper published online replaces weeks of pitches to VC firms, followed by an online auction that can take minutes. The technology can be poked and prodded by geeks around the world, providing a depth of expertise often missing at even the best Silicon Valley firms. “You don’t have to limit yourself,” said Jae Kwon, who raised $16.8 million in a coin sale for Cosmos, which aims to provide custodian-like service for transactions across different blockchains. “There are just not that many VCs and they’re not experts. People who contributed to our fundraiser are the experts.” — With assistance by Lily Katz"

         & Sam Kim
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-23/cybersleuths-unearth-more-clues-linking-wannacry-to-north-korea,"Cybersecurity researchers at Symantec Corp. and FireEye Inc. have uncovered more evidence tying this month’s WannaCry global ransomware attacks to North Korea. The cyberattack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers worldwide was “highly likely” to have originated with Lazarus, a hacking group linked to the reclusive state, Symantec said. The software used was virtually identical to versions employed in attacks earlier this year attributed to the same agency, the company said in a report late Monday. FireEye on Tuesday agreed WannaCry shared unique code with malware previously linked to North Korea. “The shared code likely means that, at a minimum, WannaCry operators share software development resources with North Korean espionage operators,” Ben Read, a FireEye analyst, said in an emailed statement. North Korean diplomats and official media have denied in recent days that the country played any role in the attacks. WannaCry, the malware behind a global cyberattack dubbed “unprecedented” by Europol, infected an estimated 200,000 computers worldwide, infiltrating global institutions from the the U.K.’s National Health Service to FedEx Corp. and PetroChina Co. It gave its victims 72 hours to pay typically $300 in bitcoin or risk permanent loss of data. As of last Friday however, the estimated total amount of ransom paid failed to hit six figures. The initial attack was stifled when a security researcher disabled a key mechanism used by the worm to spread, but experts said the hackers were likely to mount a second attack because so many users of personal computers with Microsoft operating systems couldn’t or didn’t download a security patch released in March labeled “critical.” Last week, a Google researcher posted on Twitter that an early version of WannaCry shared some of the same programming code as malicious software used by Lazarus, the alleged North Korean government hackers behind an attack on Sony Corp. in 2014 and the theft of $81 million from a Bangladeshi central bank account at the New York Fed last year.  Other researchers have speculated that if the perpetrators were indeed North Korean, their intent may have been to cause a widespread internet outage to coincide with a scheduled missile test. “Despite the links to Lazarus, the WannaCry attacks do not bear the hallmarks of a nation-state campaign but are more typical of a cybercrime campaign,” Symantec wrote in its report."
2017-05-24T13:31:10.287Z,"VIX Trading, Hoaxes and Blockchain","Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-24/vix-trading-hoaxes-and-blockchain,"VIX manipulation!? The CBOE Volatility Index -- the VIX -- is a measure of expected volatility in the S&P 500 index. People pay more for options when they expect prices to be volatile, and you can compute implied volatility from option prices. So the VIX looks at the trading prices of a bunch of out-of-the-money put and call options on the S&P 500 and computes a sort of average implied volatility from them. The methodology is in this white paper. In addition to being an index that is much quoted in articles about market complacency, the VIX is used as a reference price for derivatives: If you want to bet that stock-market volatility will go up, or down, you can buy or sell futures or options on the VIX. These products are cash settled: The VIX is not a thing you can own, so if your option ends up in the money you just get paid cash for the value of the VIX at settlement. CBOE gets an official settlement level of the VIX based on a special monthly settlement auction of S&P 500 options. The auction runs from 7:30 a.m to 8:30 a.m., Chicago time. Traders submit bids and offers for S&P 500 options, the auction matches buyers and sellers to find clearing prices, and the prices of those S&P 500 options are used to compute the official settlement level of the VIX. Guess what? That's from this paper by John Griffin and Amin Shams of the University of Texas, who find a lot of trading in the S&P 500 options underlying the VIX during these settlement auctions, trading that pushes the settlement price of the VIX up or down. So for instance in months where the trading pushes the VIX up, the prevailing price of the VIX-influencing options will jump during the auction, peak at around 8:15 a.m. (the deadline for VIX-related bids in the auction), and then drop seconds after the auction ends when the options start trading normally: The blue line there is a measure of the indicative prices of VIX-influencing options, spiking at 8:00 a.m. and peaking near 8:15. (If you ignore the numbers on the axis, you can almost think of it as being a chart of the VIX price.) The red dot is the trading price of those options about 25 seconds after the auction finishes. The average effect is something like 0.31 VIX points, sometimes up and sometimes down, depending on the month.  What is going on? Usually when you see patterns like this, the innocent explanation is hedging. But Griffin and Shams consider and reject that notion here, noting for instance that traders don't seem to be closing out existing hedge positions but instead adding new ones. They argue that it's more likely to be explained by attempts to move the VIX: If you are a dealer who is long (short) VIX futures, you can push up (down) the VIX at settlement by buying (selling) some deep-out-of-the-money S&P 500 options. That is generically true in any derivatives market: If you are long a derivative, you can buy the underlying and push up the derivative price. But Griffin and Shams give a list of reasons why you'd almost expect the VIX to be manipulated: Griffin and Shams calculate that ""the size of VIX futures with open interest at settlement is on average 5.7 times the size SPX options traded at settlement, and it is 7.3 times for VIX options that are in-the-money at settlement."" So if you are a trader who owns a lot of the market in VIX futures, you could push around a large dollar value of futures by trading a small dollar value in options. This is particularly true because the S&P option volume is divided among many strikes, and the illiquid deep out-of-the-money S&P 500 options have a big influence on the VIX: You can move the price of those options a lot with relatively small trades, and those price changes have a disproportionate effect on the VIX. If cattle are trading at the wrong price when your cattle futures settle, that doesn't matter so much, because you just get the cattle. But you can't just get the VIX: You get cash, so if the VIX is at the wrong price at settlement, that's the price you get. You don't have to intervene over some long period to keep options prices up; you can just submit bids in the pre-opening auction once a month and move the settlement price for that month. There is a sort of hierarchy of manipulability in markets. At the top is Libor manipulation: Trillions of dollars of derivatives settled based on Libor, but Libor was calculated by essentially asking banks ""what should Libor be?"" The banks didn't even have to do any trading in order to push the number around; manipulation was, in effect, costless. (Later, with the fines, it was costly.) At the bottom is, like, manipulating the price of a stock by trading that stock. There are cases of it! It's a thing. But it is a dumb thing; it really shouldn't work. If you buy a stock, you will push the price up, sure. But to make any money you then have to sell the stock, which should push the price right back down.  But if you are going to manipulate a tradable market -- as opposed to a made-up one like Libor -- then VIX looks pretty tempting. The product that you trade (S&P 500 options) is different from the product where you make your money (VIX futures and options), and the trading market is in the relevant sense smaller than the derivative market: You can move a lot of value in VIX products by trading a small amount of value, in a confined period of time, in the underlying market. So you can cheerfully lose money executing the manipulation -- trading the S&P options -- and make back more in the derivative.  If Griffin and Shams are right that there's manipulation, there's no particular pattern to it: Sometimes VIX gets anomalously pushed up during the settlement, sometimes down. That's consistent with, for instance, a story of big dealers adding up their positions before each monthly settlement, realizing that they're net long (short), and trying to push VIX up (down) to help out their positions. It would be like the kind of Libor manipulation that banks did to help out their trading books (which was up or down depending on their positions) -- not the kind of Libor manipulation that banks also did to disguise their funding costs (which moved Libor systematically down). VIX manipulation, if it exists, probably doesn't add to or subtract from the market's sense of complacency. It just makes someone money. The email hoaxer strikes again. The guy who previously emailed Barclays PLC Chief Executive Officer Jes Staley pretending to be Barclays Chairman John McFarlane, eliciting polite bafflement from Staley, has now emailed Bank of England Governor Mark Carney pretending to be Anthony Habgood (the chairman of the bank's Court of Directors), and elicited polite bafflement from Carney. Carney was a bit tougher on his pretend-chairman than Staley was: Good for him. I have to say that Staley and Carney come off great in these hoaxes. They are perfect models of how to respond to inappropriate emails from your boss: Refuse to take the bait, try to smoothly shift the conversation into less awkward lines, but if he persists, be firm but respectful in shutting him down. Eventually the hoaxer will email a sexist joke to a bank CEO who'll reply ""hahahaha good one, also I killed a man last night,"" but so far the bankers are 2 for 2 on probity and tact. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. The Consensus 2017 blockchain conference is going on now, and Fidelity Investments Chief Executive Officer Abigail Johnson gave a speech endorsing bitcoin and blockchain technology, ""a rare vote of confidence by a major player in the financial world."" Ehh I can't go an hour without getting a press release about some big bank joining, or starting, some blockchain consortium. Citigroup is a top sponsor of Consensus. I think it is fair to say that votes of confidence, or at least expressions of interest, from large financial services companies are pretty common, though that interest is mainly in blockchain technology, not bitcoin or other digital currencies. Like the other big players interested in blockchain, Johnson acknowledged problems with current efforts. “Too often we see bitcoin and blockchain technologies as solutions in search of a problem,” said Johnson, whose firm has ""enabled bitcoin payments in its cafeteria."" ""How can we buy lunch,"" Fidelity employees wondered for years. Committees were set up to study the problem; solutions were tried and rejected; nothing worked. The employees were starving. And then one day, necessity being the mother of invention, someone proposed using bitcoin to solve this pressing problem. It was a perfect fit! Fidelity employees all have a lot of bitcoins, and bitcoins are an incredibly convenient way to pay for a sandwich. Hahaha no. Don't you think the actual story was that someone at Fidelity was like ""what on earth can we do with bitcoin,"" and someone else was like ""uhh I guess we could accept it in the cafeteria""? Even if you think that blockchain is often a solution in search of a problem, you can't help searching for some problems for it. ""Fewer than 100 employees at the firm have completed bitcoin transactions, she said.""  Elsewhere, Allison Schrager asks: ""Should you seriously consider bitcoin for your retirement savings?"" Oil data. Here's a story about services that track oil-market data, including one that ""aims to use computer algorithms to analyze satellite imagery, financial data and social news."" But the real fun is in the lower-tech services: Isn't that charming? Professional oil traders pay for professional data services that provide them with professional data. (Satellites, etc.) Amateur oil traders get free data services that provide them with Google spreadsheets. You might quite reasonably say, look, there is no way for these hobbyists to compete with professional traders whose job is to trade oil and who have access to the best data. And yet they keep trying. It's important to realize that not all trading in financial markets is driven by economic considerations. Sometimes people trade because it is fun. Elsewhere in privileged access to energy information, Carl Icahn's CVR Energy Inc. saved about $60 million by delaying purchases of renewable identification numbers as Icahn was advising Donald Trump to change renewable-fuel rules to make RINs less valuable.  Executive education. Here is a Harvard Crimson article about about non-degree-granting executive education courses at the Harvard Business School, which includes this lovely bit of intra-Harvard snark (about Tyra Banks): Hahaha it is a little hard for Harvard students to imagine choosing executives for business education based on their business skills rather than their standardized test scores. But there is this: For $14,000 a week, even Harvard can dispense with the GMAT. Elsewhere in graduate business education, here's ""Why Stanford MBAs Earn the Most"": I am skeptical that ""pursue your passion"" is a good generally applicable way to make a lot of money, but perhaps it works for MBA students. Maybe their passion is money! People are worried about unicorns. Here is a Farhad Manjoo article about Opendoor, a startup that has raised more than $300 million of equity capital. The article is also about what Manjoo calls ""the fat start-up"": Private markets are, as I like to say, the new public markets, and it's no sweat now to raise a few hundred million dollars without going public. But if you stay private you can still be a startup: There's less pressure to be profitable, more freedom to pursue ambitious business plans, if you don't answer to public investors.   One other thing to say about Opendoor is that it is a residential real estate trading firm: It buys houses, and then tries to resell them at a profit. There is technology involved, sure: Opendoor analyzes home-price data on computers rather than sending appraisers out to decide how much homes are worth; ""houses it sells are fitted with internet-enabled cameras, sensors and door locks""; there's a website and an app. But the business model is not ""we build software and sell it,"" or ""we build websites and sell ads against them."" It's ""we buy houses and try to resell them at a profit."" It's a real estate company. But the imperial ambitions of Silicon Valley mean that it's also a tech startup because, you know, everything is a tech startup, and tech startups are where the money is. You can raise money from technology venture capitalists to sell bags of wet vegetables, or houses: Everything in the world is technology, so tech investors can invest in anything. Elsewhere in unicorns, the Wall Street Journal visited the Park Slope unicorn store: People are worried about bond market liquidity. The New York Fed's Liberty Street Economics blog is keeping this worry alive with ""Dealer Balance Sheets and Corporate Bond Liquidity Provision."" ""We find that post-crisis regulation has had an adverse impact on bond-level liquidity,"" the authors conclude, in line with what most bond traders think but somewhat contrary to what most previous Fed and Treasury analyses have found. Meanwhile in Greece, bond market liquidity is quite poor: Food Stuff.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-22/toyota-merck-join-ethereum-group-to-build-blockchain-network,"An effort to transform how businesses work by using blockchain technology added new members from multiple industries as Toyota Motor Corp., Merck KGaA, State Street Corp. and other companies joined industry group the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. They join existing EEA members JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP LP, Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ING Groep NV that are all trying to determine if shared databases recorded on the ethereum blockchain can cut costs by speeding up financial transactions or ensuring the efficiency of a supply chain. The reason ethereum is creating such interest among industries from finance to health care is because it allows for much more complex actions to be done in a shared and decentralized manner than with bitcoin, which introduced the first blockchain to the world in 2009. The bitcoin blockchain is like a banking system that runs itself -- but its main use is just to allow people to move the digital currency from one place to another. Ethereum’s ledger does more. It stores fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts on its blockchain: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A and so on. Ethereum is a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts -- which are just operating procedures -- you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. “The enthusiasm around EEA is remarkable,"" Julio Faura, chairman of EEA and head of blockchain innovation at Banco Santander SA, said in a statement announcing the additions to the group. ""Our new members come from varying industries such as pharma, mobile, banking, automotive, management consulting, and hardware.” Toyota, for example, is experimenting with ethereum to help it develop self-driving cars and other uses.  ""Toyota Research Institute supports the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance and its members in promoting common standards and tools to accelerate the adoption of this technology and the potential benefits for Toyota’s customers,” Chris Ballinger, chief financial officer of the car company’s unit Toyota Research Institute, said in the statement. John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. European aircraft maker Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Merck, which says it’s the world’s oldest chemical and pharmaceutical company in the world dating back nearly 350 years, said its history isn’t stopping it from being innovative. ""Curiosity fuels business development and enables companies like ours to remain competitive,"" Andreas Schindler, director ideation, innovation and technology foresight for the company, said in the statement. ""We are curious to co-create with the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance on distributed ledger architectures and solutions for future digital markets in health care and life sciences.” Adoption of blockchain technology such as ethereum has significant hurdles to overcome, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. There is also the fact that very few if any actual uses of blockchain have been released to date. Regulators also have to be convinced the system is safe. And the EEA is far from alone in seeking an edge in creating standards for blockchain systems. Competitors include R3, Chain, Digital Asset Holdings and the Hyperledger Project."

         & Matthew Leising
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-23/fidelity-s-abby-johnson-urges-resolution-to-blockchain-barriers,"Abby Johnson, chairman and chief executive officer of Fidelity Investments, urged a broad group of software developers, entrepreneurs and academics to work together to solve problems that are preventing the broader adoption of blockchain technology. ""You are the community who will drive the future of this technology. I challenge you to start collaborating together -- and I don’t just mean with people that think like you -- we need to be having hard conversations,” Johnson said in prepared remarks Tuesday at the Consensus 2017 conference in New York. Johnson told the gathering of the blockchain industry that her firm isn’t giving up on digital currencies despite hurdles. She pointed to several barriers to blockchain adoption, including limits of the technology, policy issues, control of the systems and customer usability. While blockchain technology has drawn attention from the financial industry because of its potential to free up billions of dollars in capital, it also faces significant hurdles, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. Regulators must also be convinced that linked networks of computers can be trusted to manage aspects of some of the world’s most important financial markets. JPMorgan Chase & Co., BP Plc, Microsoft Corp., International Business Machines Corp. and ING Groep NV are among companies trying to determine if shared databases recorded on the blockchain can cut costs by speeding financial transactions or ensuring the efficiency of a supply chain. Fidelity has invested in blockchain through venture deals with TradeBlock, Axoni and Boost VC and forged academic partnerships to explore the area, Johnson said. The firm’s innovation group, Fidelity Labs, has also been conducting research and experiments in the area. ""Blockchain technology isn’t just a more efficient way to settle securities -- it will fundamentally change market structures -- and maybe even the architecture of the Internet itself,"" she said. The virtual currency bitcoin introduced the world to the first blockchain in 2009. Since then, a more expansive type of software has gained attention. Called ethereum, its blockchain does far more than allowing bitcoin users to send value from one person to another as easily as sending an email. Ethereum is gaining interest among industries from finance to health care because it allows for much more complex actions to be done in a shared and decentralized manner. It stores fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts on its blockchain. Ethereum is a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once participants create contracts they can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. Still, such technology isn’t able to offer scalability, privacy and peer-to-peer settlement all at once, she said. Fidelity is focused on investing in privacy since that’s important to customers, Johnson said. Johnson also encouraged the industry to have an open dialogue with regulators because the technology’s rapid growth is making it difficult for them to keep up. ""Talk with people on the opposite side of the argument. Talk with people who are using these products. Talk with big businesses and the regulators. And come talk to us -- we need to hear your voice,"" she told the conference. Johnson, who has been CEO since 2014, took full control of Fidelity from her father, Edward ""Ned"" Johnson, in November 2016. She’s the third generation to run the company and, like her family members, keeps a low profile. The firm had $6.1 trillion in assets under administration, including managed assets of $2.2 trillion, as of April 30."
2017-05-21T21:00:17.770Z,Think Twice About Going Cashless,"Satyajit Das
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-21/world-should-think-twice-before-abolishing-cash,"Even now, after the chaos caused by India's decision last November to eliminate nearly 90 percent of its banknotes, few people would argue with the policy's underlying assumption: Going cashless is, if handled well, a good thing. Yet the fact is, most arguments in favor of demonetization don't stand up to scrutiny. And those that do should raise other concerns. Proponents of moving beyond paper money cite several rationales. They say it'll make life harder for tax cheats, terrorists and other criminals, and speed up the flow of funds, thus reducing costs and enhancing economic efficiency. Some even suggest that it will improve hygiene, by eliminating crumpled and germ-infested bills. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain These arguments aren't terribly convincing. To start, banning cash is inherently discriminatory. It doesn't distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate uses of paper money, assuming that anyone holding large amounts of cash must be guilty of something. This disadvantages the clear majority of the population in order to punish a minority. More importantly, abolishing cash isn't likely to solve the problems it's meant to address. Criminals and terrorists will simply seek out alternative methods of transferring funds, even if they happen to be more expensive. Unless taken unawares, tax cheats can easily convert their illicit hoardings into gold, foreign currency or property. Even in India, where Modi's decision came out of the blue, most of the outstanding currency was redeposited into bank accounts without providing the predicted increase in tax collections. Surely, though, moving to virtual cash will boost innovation and efficiency? Fintech firms, sensing a gold rush, have indeed proposed innovative digital payment solutions. But there's no clear-cut evidence that electronic payments are especially efficient or cost-effective. European studies have found that cash incurred the lowest cost per transaction in most countries, followed by debit-card transactions. This shouldn't be surprising, given economies of scale and high usage of existing systems. In the U.S., cash is still used for a bit more than 40 percent of consumer transactions by volume, around half that by value. In emerging markets, and for small-value transactions generally, the numbers are even higher. Meanwhile, the digital-payments sector remains fragmented and requires large infrastructure investments, often duplicating existing systems. The real arguments in favor of cashlessness aren't as often discussed. Demonetization, for example, would provide central banks with a powerful new tool. Currently, negative rates can be circumvented by investors physically withdrawing cash and holding it to avoid the effective tax on savings. That helps explain why large cash holdings are particularly prevalent in Japan and Switzerland -- two countries not generally associated with criminals or terrorists, but which do feature negative interest rates. In a future economic or financial crisis, this so-called zero-lower-bound constraint could restrict the effectiveness of monetary policy. The only way to overcome the hurdle may be to eliminate cash, as the Bank of England's chief economist Andrew Haldane argued in 2015. Demonetization could help governments in other ways as well. Behavioral studies show that consumers spend more when using a credit card than when using cash. Eliminating cash could thus in theory be used to boost consumption. On the other hand, forcing citizens to do all their spending digitally would also provide states with unprecedented levels of personal information. The anonymity of cash is useful to everyone, not just tax cheats and criminals. The costs to abolishing cash aren't insignificant either. Central banks would lose seigniorage revenue, or the difference between the minimal cost of creating currency and the investment return on government bonds. This would reduce their loss-absorption capacity and impact a source of revenue, affecting public finances. Cash use remains high in emerging markets, and among the poor and older people globally. As quickly became clear in India, demonetization can thus worsen social and financial exclusion. The costs of converting citizens to digital payments can quickly add up. An exclusively digital or electronic payment system also increases security and operational risks. The risks of online fraud or cyber-theft, as well as disruptions to operations due to technology failures, are significant. The intrusion of the state on this scale is an explosive social or political issue rather than an arcane economic matter. In his speech advocating cashlessness, Haldane accepted that public support was uncertain. Citizens may not easily surrender their anonymity and privacy. Where the elimination of cash is linked to negative rates, they may resist what's effectively a tax on savers. Nations that truly want to go cashless need to confront these questions truthfully and openly, rather than hiding behind more politically palatable arguments. Simply imposing such a radical change on citizens would only further erode trust in governments. That's a cost they're ill-equipped to pay.

2017-05-17T21:00:00.002Z,Inside Bitfinex's Comeback From a $69 Million Bitcoin Heist,"Yuji Nakamura
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-17/inside-bitfinex-s-comeback-from-a-69-million-bitcoin-heist,"After hackers stole $69 million from Bitfinex last year, the bitcoin exchange’s fate seemed sealed: lawsuits, bankruptcy and years of liquidation proceedings. That’s what happened to Mt. Gox, the high-profile marketplace for trading the virtual currency, which lost $480 million. There were also other smaller implosions such as Cointrader and Bitcurex. But against the odds, Bitfinex pulled out of its spiral dive, announcing last month that all customers were repaid. The exchange posted its most profitable month and claimed its spot as the largest bitcoin venue for U.S. dollar trading. “We’ve demonstrated an alternative to bankruptcy,” said Phil Potter, 45, Bitfinex’s chief strategy officer. Behind the turnaround, unusual in an industry with few safeguards, is a combination of an uptick in market activity that boosted fee-based income and a mostly successful effort to mollify angry customers with an innovative market-based solution to how everyone would be compensated. Assuming the strategy doesn’t unravel down the road, Bitfinex may prove to be a valuable template for how the bitcoin community deals with a crisis in the future. On Aug. 2, as the U.S. presidential election got into full swing after the Republican and Democratic conventions, Potter got an early morning phone call at his beach home in Long Island saying hackers had breached security and were draining customer deposits. Bitfinex’s executives don’t work in a single location, but are peppered throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. Its parent company iFinex Inc. is incorporated in the British Virgin Islands, while back office functions are done in Taiwan, technology support is concentrated in London and the compliance team is run out of Hong Kong. While the exchange succeeded in protecting U.S. dollar and other currency deposits, by the time they could block access, thieves had walked away with about 57 percent of bitcoin deposits. Even though the virtual currency exists as software, it can be stolen and transactions are irreversible. In the aftermath, bitcoin briefly slumped 15 percent against the dollar. “The first thought we all had was, ‘Oh my god, is this another Mt. Gox?’"" said Harry Yeh, managing partner at digital currency dealer Binary Financial and a large Bitfinex customer. A key concern was whether another large bitcoin exchange implosion would undermine the virtual currency’s ecosystem and trigger a bear market like the one that followed Mt. Gox’s demise in 2014. As Potter, who once worked in Morgan Stanley’s wealth-management business, and other Bitfinex executives assessed the damage, they spoke to bankruptcy lawyers. After four sleepless days, they decided against shutting down the exchange and bet they could pull out of the mess. The first step was the toughest. Bitfinex decided to ‘socialize’ losses evenly among all customers and apply a 36 percent haircut to every account. Even though some people’s bitcoin weren’t stolen, the exchange had a margin lending system that affected almost everyone. Unsurprisingly, users whose accounts weren’t breached were outraged and began rounding up allies to file class actions. “We thought we might still have had to go in to bankruptcy, and if we did, this is likely how it would have had to work out: everyone takes an equal hit,"" Potter said. On the whole, however, the community saw the benefits of avoiding a drawn out bankruptcy with their money locked up indefinitely, and were relieved to receive at least 64 percent of their money back. Next, Bitfinex sweetened the deal by issuing IOU tokens to each customer equal to the 36 percent that was taken from their accounts. Management promised the tokens would eventually be exchanged for cash or equity in Bitfinex’s parent company. In another clever move, Bitfinex said users could trade the tokens and let the market decide how much they were worth. Customers who wanted nothing more to do with Bitfinex could sell the instruments at a discount and walk away. Those who believed they would be repaid could gamble on a recovery by snapping up more tokens, although U.S. customers were given fewer options in order to comply with local regulations. Initially, the price of each token plunged to around 15 cents on the dollar, indicating that traders thought there was only a one-in-eight chance the exchange would make good on its promise to pay back losses. Then, the value of each token began to pick up as Bitfinex’s big customers started buying. Within a month, prices were at about 50 cents on the dollar. Potter said Bitfinex insiders and employees were barred from trading tokens. Eventually, a virtuous cycle kicked in. As the tokens rose in value, confidence swelled and traders returned, boosting earnings from transaction fees and the likelihood of a successful turnaround. In mid-October, customers agreed to convert about a third of all tokens into equity. The deal valued the parent company at $200 million, underscoring the recovery in confidence. A bitcoin rally that began last year, with prices more than doubling since August, also lifted market turnover. Bitfinex used the profits and drew down reserves to exchange more of the tokens for cash each month. The cycle continued until March when, with income at an all-time high and tokens trading at more than 90 cents on the dollar, management redeemed the remaining tokens and announced the recovery complete. “They didn’t go into receivership, nobody lost money and now if anything they’re back and bigger and more profitable than ever,” said Binary Financial’s Yeh. Not everyone was happy. Some smaller customers sold their tokens early, failing to recoup most of their losses. Essentially, the token market inherently favored bigger customers, whose close relationship with Bitfinex gave them a better idea of their potential. That also made it harder for disgruntled users to find allies to sue the exchange. Still, it might be too early for Bitfinex to celebrate. Two weeks after announcing the $69 million was paid off, Bitfinex was forced to halt withdrawals and deposits of fiat currencies after its banks stopped processing payments. Potter said the situation is improving, but it remains unclear when access to fiat funding will be restored. Meanwhile, Mt. Gox’s customers are still waiting for details on when and how much money they’ll get back. The trustee overseeing the liquidation told creditors in March that the investigation ""is still on-going."" While it’s not clear whether Bitfinex’s recovery strategy is one that will be adopted for another crisis, the idea of using tradeable tokens is catching on. Used as derivatives that represent a share of future profits, equity or any other underlying asset, the tokens are gaining in popularity because they are unregulated and can be immediately bought and sold. “Bitfinex’s recovery is an example of people starting to get creative with how to utilize tokenized systems to engineer solutions or mechanism that previously didn’t exist,” said Brian Lio, who runs research firm Smith + Crown. “Groups are going to step forward and try and come up with solutions in the absence of regulations.” (An earlier version of this story was corrected to show that employees were barred from buying or selling tokens.)"
2017-05-19T12:55:00.969Z,"As Deadline Begins to Pass, WannaCry Falls Short of Six Figures","Nate Lanxon
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-19/as-deadline-begins-to-pass-wannacry-falls-short-of-six-figures,"One week ago a global cyberattack dubbed “unprecedented” by Europol began infecting an estimated 200,000 of the world’s computers, starting a seven-day countdown to the destruction of data if victims didn’t pay a ransom. On Friday, those countdowns begin reaching zero. But so far, as of 13:00 in London, the attackers have claimed only about $92,000 in payments from their widespread ransom demands, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a U.K-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculates the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands. The ransomware, called WannaCry, began infecting users on May 12 and gave them 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin or pay twice as much. Refusal to pay after seven days was promised to result in the permanent loss of data via irrevocable encryption. Witt affected institutions including the National Health Service., FedEx Corp. and PetroChina, few initially paid up, leading to speculation that organizations were taking their chances on fixing their corrupt machines before the ransom forced a mass deletion of critical data. A week later, experts agree the financial gains of the hackers remain astonishingly low. “With over 200,000 machines affected, the figure is lower than expected,” said Jamie Akhtar, co-founder of the London-based security software firm CyberSmart. “If even 1 percent paid the ransom that would be $600k.” Akhtar said we experts may never know how much larger this figure would have been if a so-called kill switch wasn't accidentally triggered by a cyber security researcher, who registered an internet domain that acted as a disabling tool for the worm’s propagation. While the world’s law enforcement is pointing its resources at trying to identify the culprits, Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises, says it’s unlikely the money taken from victims will be taken from the digital bitcoin wallets they’re being anonymously held in. “Given the amount of scrutiny this has come under, I would be surprised if they moved it anytime soon,” he said. “I just don't think the risk is worth the $90,000 they've raised so far.” Akhtar agrees but doesn’t think the criminals have given up hope while machines infected later still have time ticking on their ransom countdown. “It seems like they are still actively trying to bring funds in,” he said, noting a Twitter post from Symantec Corp. Thursday, which seemed to show fresh messaging from the attackers promising to hold their end of the decryption bargain if victims paid up. Akhtar believes the best thing the perpetrators can do to hide from authorities is “destroy any evidence and abandon the bitcoin wallets.” Of course, the hack may have nothing to do with money at all. Any movement of funds from a bitcoin wallet would act as a valuable clue for law enforcement as to who is behind the attack. Preliminary finger-pointing has already targeted groups with suspected links to the North Korean regime, but clues are few are far between still.  "
2017-05-17T12:23:49.167Z,"Bitcoin's Link to Crime Is a Growing Worry, Nordea Bank Warns","Peter Levring
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-17/bitcoin-s-link-to-crime-is-a-growing-worry-nordea-bank-warns,"The biggest bank in the Nordic region says this month’s ransomware attack underscores the need for lawmakers to look more closely at bitcoin’s role in financial crime. Nordea Bank AB, whose chief risk officer, Julie Galbo, testified to the Danish parliament on Tuesday in response to questions about management’s efforts to fight money laundering, says virtual currencies like bitcoin are making that battle harder to win. “Bitcoin is an unregulated and opaque currency that’s often used in shady transactions,” Galbo told Bloomberg after testifying. She says bitcoin represents a “big risk” standing in the way of efforts to fight money laundering because of the anonymity it affords those who use it. Nordea has been investigated by authorities in Denmark and Sweden for its failures to comply with anti-money laundering requirements. Last year, it was also responding to inquiries from the U.S. government on alleged breaches of anti-money laundering rules that have already led to fines in Sweden. The bank, the only global systemically important financial institution in the Nordic region, featured prominently in the Panama Papers for allegedly helping rich clients hide their wealth from tax authorities. Management, led by Chief Executive Officer Casper von Koskull, has tried to address the criticisms, adding hundreds of people to Nordea’s compliance department. Galbo, who used to work at Denmark’s financial regulator, said “patterns of financial crime change constantly,” making it increasingly difficult for those fighting it to do their jobs. She says working closer with the relevant authorities, including sharing knowledge, would help banks comply with the rules. Galbo said WannaCry, which affected more than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries, is a clear example underscoring the need to treat bitcoin with suspicion. The hackers gave those targeted 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin. If people refused to pay after seven days, their computers would be permanently locked. Galbo told lawmakers in the Danish parliament that aside from complying with the law, Nordea is “morally obliged” to do everything in its power to prevent its systems being used in connection with money laundering. While bitcoin was singled out for criticism, Galbo said the technology behind the payment form -- blockchain -- was something Nordea continues to view “very positively.”"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-15/hardly-anyone-paying-the-hackers-because-using-bitcoin-is-hard,"An unprecedented cyberattack swept across the globe over the weekend, but so far the majority of victims haven’t paid hackers a ransom. After the ransomware began infecting users on Friday, they were given 72 hours to pay $300 in bitcoin -- chosen by the hackers because the crypto currency is harder to track than conventional payments -- or pay twice as much. If they refused to pay after seven days, their computer would be permanently locked -- a serious problem for those who haven’t backed up their data. As of early Monday, only about $50,000 had been paid in ransoms, according to Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a London-based company that tracks illicit use of bitcoin. The company calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands, adding that it expects the total to rise. ""The amount is indeed low,"" said Michela Menting, digital security research director at ABI Research. ""This is likely due to the fact that organizations have initiated their backup and recovery procedures."" Moreover, for those who didn’t save their data on a separate system, paying a ransom isn’t like buying something from Amazon by entering their credit or debit card information. Even though the hackers provided a helpful link for those new to paying in bitcoin, the crypto currency is a black box for most people. ""If you’re presented with something that says pay this amount in bitcoin, most people don’t know where to start with that,"" said James Smith, the CEO and co-founder of Elliptic. There are several steps. First, a person or business has to obtain the bitcoins by registering with one of the various online exchanges and going through its verification process. After that, money can be deposited into the exchange. For those living in countries that don’t have an exchange, including the U.K., money must be converted into another currency. Once the money is deposited on the exchange, the bitcoins can be sent to the address provided by the extortionist. ""It looks like a long garbled string of text,"" Smith said. After the fee is paid, the hackers supposedly free the affected computer. ""A large amount of bitcoin is actually somewhat difficult to source quickly,"" said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at bitcoin research company CoinDesk, adding it might take a few days to create an account at a bitcoin brokerage or exchange, connect a bank account, and then receive the bitcoin. One notable difference with this attack is that the perpetrators demanded a relatively small amount of money but from a large number of people, said James Chappell, chief technology officer and co-founder of U.K. security company Digital Shadows. More typically, he said, hackers demand one large ransom to unlock all the infected machines. ""Quite often they’re in the thousands rather than the hundreds of dollars,"" he said. ""It is unusual to see this piecemeal approach, computer by computer."" Although harder than tracking a traditional bank payment, hunting down the bitcoin payments will be a key way law enforcement authorities attempt to track down those responsible. It’s almost impossible to know who the perpetrators are based on the bitcoin addresses they give to victims, according to Elliptic, but once the bitcoins are moved from that address, it can be tracked, potentially helping lead to the culprits. ""There are things you can do to identify the actors behind suspicious addresses or transactions,"" says Kevin Beardsley, head of business development at Elliptic, which also works with law enforcement."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-18/the-wannacry-global-hack-could-have-been-much-much-worse,"On the morning of May 12, computer systems were held for ransom as a cyberattack on companies and critical infrastructure began to pinball around the world, rolling through Spain’s Telefónica SA, French carmaker Renault SA, and Russia’s interior ministry and crippling U.K. hospitals. The rogue code has reached more than 300,000 computers that run on Microsoft Windows in thousands of companies in 150 countries. It all sounds grim. In fact, we’ve been lucky. The WannaCry ransomware, the code in question, was fairly shoddy work. It achieves the basics: spreading through the computers on a network, encrypting everything on the machines, and demanding payment to return the contents to their original form. But it can’t evade investigators the way sophisticated malware can—which is designed to avoid systems used to test for dangerous code. WannaCry is also more obvious in going about its work of destroying backup contents on a computer, so it’s easier to stop, according to Allan Liska, a ransomware expert at cybersecurity firm Recorded Future. Another stroke of luck: Within hours, a security researcher in the U.K. discovered an unregistered web address in the malware. He was able to register the domain, disabling a key mechanism the code used to spread to more computers. The amateurishness also shows in WannaCry’s bottom line. The hackers demanded payment in the digital currency bitcoin, but the wallets they set up for the ransoms show they’d gathered just a bit more than $71,000 as of May 16. We can’t depend on luck next time. These assaults are becoming the archetypal crime of the 21st century, hurtling toward us in full view. This one was heralded more than a month ago. That’s when a group calling itself Shadow Brokers released a hacking toolset targeting Windows operating systems, purportedly stolen from the National Security Agency, an intelligence branch of the U.S. Department of Defense. Researchers have been warning for weeks that criminals would begin using the toolset on vulnerable systems. What can companies and institutions do to step out of the way of these attacks? In theory it’s simple, and security experts have repeated the same phrase for decades: “Just patch.” That is, install code that replaces the bugs that give hackers entry. Microsoft Corp. released a “critical” patch in March, fixing the vulnerabilities that the Shadow Brokers tools used. Consumers get an instant fix when their machines are auto-updated by Microsoft, Apple Inc., and other technology makers. But it’s not that simple for budget-strapped institutions. The National Health Service in the U.K. is a case in point. Many of its computers work on the Windows XP operating system—so old that it’s no longer supported by the software maker, which hasn’t issued patches for it since 2014. The NHS did pay Microsoft to continue issuing special patches until 2015, but in the midst of an austerity move, it ended the £5.5 million ($7.1 million) support deal. By the time Microsoft responded to the attacks and issued an emergency patch, it was too late. Patients were stranded, emergency services hobbled. Corporations and government agencies sometimes have good reason for not patching quickly. Complex computer networks, fragile custom code, and sheer bureaucratic inertia mean organizations spend a long time testing patches to ensure they don’t break anything and cause crippling network downtime. And computers do break from patches: Some users criticized Microsoft last year when the upgrade to Windows 10 “bricked” their PCs, turning the machines into useless lumps. The financial-services industry—already among the biggest investors in cybersecurity—is so thorough and cautious in its process that it takes an average of 176 days, longer than almost any other industry, from identifying a vulnerability to fixing it, according to a study by NopSec Labs. In contrast, health-care organizations average 97 days, according to NopSec. Hospitals and doctors’ offices have the added challenge of balancing security with the demands of providing medical services, where patients don’t just stop coming in with problems on the weekends so critical systems can go offline. Most of the time, the plodding pace of improving network security is punished only mildly. In the case of WannaCry and the NHS, the result was a whipping—and it may prod reform. “Events like this raise the public’s awareness, and the more that happens the more demand there is for some type of government reaction to it,” says French Caldwell, a former Gartner Inc. analyst who’s chief evangelist at MetricStream, which makes risk analysis and compliance software. “People have to die or lose lots of money before government steps in to regulate.” The WannaCry chaos has reignited a fractious debate in Silicon Valley over who ultimately bears responsibility. Is it the customers’ fault for dilly-dallying and failing to apply a patch that Microsoft labeled “critical”? Or are tech vendors to blame for creating a system in which ancient software such as Windows XP and Server 2003 is kept on life support indefinitely for users willing to pay extra, an accommodation that simply keeps insecure software in circulation longer? “One could argue that given the severity of the vulnerability, they should have provided patches for XP and Server 2003 to everyone, not just the organizations that pay a king’s ransom for the privilege of having Microsoft support their legacy software,” says Ryan Kalember, senior vice president for cybersecurity strategy at Proofpoint, a Sunnyvale, Calif.-based email security company whose technology scans 1 billion emails a day. “To be clear, Microsoft would prefer that companies upgrade and realize the full benefits of the latest version rather than choose custom support. Security experts agree that the best protection is to be on a modern, up-to-date system that incorporates the latest defense-in-depth innovations,”  said a Microsoft spokesperson in an emailed statement. A blog post by Microsoft President Brad Smith has pointed the finger at the U.S. government, calling the attack a “wake-up call” for military and intelligence agencies to stop stockpiling tools to exploit the digital vulnerabilities of potential cyber rivals. The criticism was echoed by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who blamed the NSA and its toolkit for the WannaCry assaults, which hit his country particularly hard. Meanwhile, researchers scrambling to figure out who’s behind the ransomware have found similarities between WannaCry and code used in attacks pinned on North Korea. The identity of the perpetrators would matter less if everyone were better prepared. Patching is essential, but it’s not the only answer, says Nathaniel Gleicher, a former Department of Justice prosecutor and director of cybersecurity policy for the White House under President Obama. He’s now head of cybersecurity strategy at Illumio, which helps companies stop cyberthreats from spreading laterally inside networks, data centers, and the cloud. Companies that know they’re vulnerable but don’t want to shut down key systems to patch can reduce the potential impact by shutting off the computer ports used by malware; in the case of the Shadow Broker tools and WannaCry, that’s port 445. Defenders have to think about cybersecurity more like physical security. “You leave this door open everywhere even though you’re not using it. At some point, someone’s going to walk through it,” Gleicher says. Andrew Whinston, a University of Texas at Austin professor of management science and information systems, has been working to show what might happen if governments did intervene more actively to assess the security status of companies and give them a public rating. His research, which uses data on spam and phishing emails from thousands of business networks to give companies a security rating, suggests that government policy would spur companies to spend more on security, driven by consumer awareness. “Let’s say you have to go to the hospital, and maybe besides checking the doctors, you check the security level,” Whinston says. “If, according to the ranking from the government, this is a place that’s not all that safe, you’d say, ‘Well, I’ll drive a couple of miles more and go to a safer place.’ ” There’s no easy way to stop companies from clinging to flawed, obsolete software. But the stakes are only getting higher with the emergence of internet-connected devices deployed in previously unimaginable places, from power meters to pacemakers, some of which have no built-in security controls, says Frank Zou, founder of Sunnyvale-based startup HoloNet Security. These become new portals for infection. Says Zou: “There’s no reason not to expect future attacks to go beyond health-care organizations to other mission-critical national infrastructure like nuclear energy, water treatment plants, air traffic control, or the nation’s financial or communication systems.” In fact, an online statement purportedly posted by Shadow Brokers on May 16 promised a “Data Dump of the Month” service, with more advanced hacking tools for sale. We’ll need better luck—or better preparation—next time. (Adds comment from Microsoft Corp. in ninth paragraph.) The bottom line: The WannaCry computer hack reached 300,000 machines in 150 countries. It could have been much, much worse."
2017-05-16T07:48:50.192Z,What We Currently Know About the Global Cyberattack,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-16/expert-finds-more-north-korea-links-in-ransomware-attack,"New York (AP) -- As danger from a global cyberattack that hit some 150 nations continues to fade, analysts are starting to assess the damage. Hard-hit organizations such as the U.K.'s National Health Service appear to be bouncing back, and few people seem to have actually paid the ransom. But the attack has served as a live demonstration of a new type of global threat, one that could encourage future hackers. Here's what we currently know about the ransomware known as WannaCry, which locked up digital photos, documents and other files to hold them for ransom. WHERE IT CAME FROM Researchers are still puzzling out how WannaCry got started. Figuring that out could yield important clues to the identity of its authors. The malware spread rapidly inside computer networks by taking advantage of vulnerabilities in mostly older versions of Microsoft Windows. That weakness was purportedly identified and stockpiled for use by the U.S. National Security Agency; it was subsequently stolen and published on the internet. But it remains unclear how WannaCry got onto computers in the first place. Experts said its rapid global spread suggests it did not rely on phishing, in which fake emails tempt the unwary to click on infected documents or links. Analysts at the European Union cybersecurity agency said the hackers likely scanned the internet for systems that were vulnerable to infection and exploited those computers remotely. Once established, WannaCry encrypted computer files and displayed a message demanding $300 to $600 worth of the digital currency bitcoin to release them. Failure to pay would leave the data scrambled and likely beyond repair unless users had unaffected backup copies. RANSOM PAYMENTS Investigators are closely watching three bitcoin accounts associated with WannaCry, where its victims were directed to send ransom payments. The digital currency is anonymized, but it's possible to track funds as they move from place to place until they end up with an identifiable person. So far, there have been no withdrawals from those accounts. Given the scope of the attack, relatively few people appear to have actually paid the ransom. According to a Twitter account that monitors those accounts , they've received only about 250 payments worth a total of slightly more than $72,000. NORTH KOREA Several sets of investigators have now reported tentative findings that suggest hackers linked to North Korea might have been involved with WannaCry. But they could all be drawing conclusions from a very small set of clues. On Monday, the Russian security firm Kaspersky Lab said portions of the WannaCry program use the same code as malware previously distributed by the Lazarus Group, a hacker collective behind the 2014 Sony hack. Another security company, Symantec, related the same findings, which it characterized as intriguing but ""weak"" associations, since the code could have been copied from the Lazarus malware. Two law enforcement officials likewise said U.S. investigators suspect North Korea based on code similarities; the officials called that finding preliminary. The officials spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak publicly about an ongoing investigation. But WannaCry remains a puzzle, in part because some of its elements seemed amateurish. Salim Neino, CEO of the Los Angeles-based security firm Kryptos Logic, said the WannaCry worm was ""poorly designed"" — patched together and consisting of a ""sum of different parts"" with an unsophisticated payment system. Typical ransomware also generates a unique bitcoin account for each payment to make tracing difficult. That wasn't done here. DIGGING OUT One of the organizations hardest hit by WannaCry — the U.K.'s National Health Service — appears to be recovering. On Friday, many NHS hospitals had to turn away patients after WannaCry locked up computers, forcing the closure of wards and emergency rooms. NHS Digital, the body that oversees cybersecurity in Britain's health system, said that as of now, it has ""no evidence that patient data has been compromised."" The agency told hospitals to disconnect all infected computers, apply a Microsoft patch that closes the vulnerability, then ""roll back"" the infected computers and restore them from backed-up files. U.K. hospitals are supposed to back up data frequently and at multiple locations. It's possible that some data that wasn't backed up could be lost. SIGN OF HACKS TO COME WannaCry could also serve as a kind of template for future cyberattacks. Neino of Kryptos Logic, for instance, said the leak of the NSA hacking tools have significantly narrowed the gap between nations and individuals or cyber gangs. ""The concern has always been, when are the real bad guys, the ones that don't care about rules of engagement, the ones who are really out to hurt us, will they become cyber-capable?"" he said in an interview Monday night with The Associated Press. ""I think today we found out that those who really want to hurt us have begun to, because they became cyber-capable the moment that the NSA cybertools were released."" ___ Jill Lawless and Sheila Norman-Culp in London and Michael Balsamo in Los Angeles contributed to this report."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-12/and-a-bitcoin-is-now-worth,"With a 94 percent year-to-date gain, and a single ""coin"" now worth $1,843, bitcoin has been on a helluva run lately.  The increase in the cost of the massively-volatile electronic tokens has led to many comparisons with that other favorite outsider ""currency'' — gold — recently. True, a unit of bitcoin passed the dollar value of one troy ounce of gold this year, and is now more than $600 higher.  But the daily swings in the digitally created asset have been vast. Even during the huge run up this year, it has moved more than five percent on 21 different days, with nine of those being moves lower. Gold on the other hand, has been much more stable.   Volatility aside, there is a major problem with gold as a comparator for the software-based unit.  Nobody thinks comparing one share of Apple Inc.  — current price around $155 — with one share of, for example, outdoor lighting company Acuity Brands Inc. — current price around $178 — is valid. It certainly does not show that Acuity, with its market cap of $7.9 billion, is worth more than Apple's market cap of $814 billion. By the time the supply of new bitcoins ends, sometime after the year 2110, there will be 21 million bitcoins in (digital) existence, meaning the total value of all of the electronic tokens that will ever exist, at today's market price, is just under $39 billion. According to the World Gold Council, total gold stocks amount to approximately six billion troy ounces, or $7.3 trillion at today's price. To put it another way, in order for bitcoin to be worth more than gold, one 'coin' would have to trade at $347,000 in order for 'bitcoin worth more than gold' to be a defensible statement. Must dash now, one bitcoin is about be worth more than one aluminum future... (Corrects spelling in first and fourth charts.)"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-15/fireeye-symantec-jump-as-ransomware-hack-seen-boosting-spending,"FireEye Inc., Symantec Corp. and other cybersecurity stocks jumped Monday as a global computer hacking attack entered its third day, suggesting higher corporate and government spending on their technology will follow. A wave of threats demanding a ransom of $300 to unlock the computer or risk losing data hit more than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries from the U.S. to Europe to Asia. The malware used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. The victims were given 72 hours to pay the ransom in bitcoin. FireEye, which provides software security services, rose as much as 8.8 percent in New York. Analysts at Oppenheimer Securities said the Milpitas, California-based company could be the biggest beneficiary of higher cybersecurity spending, due to its exposure in Europe, where the most high-profile of the attacks occurred. At the height of the crisis Friday and early Saturday, 48 organizations in Britain’s National Health Service were affected, and hospitals in London and elsewhere urged people with non-emergency conditions to stay away as technicians tried to stop the spread of the malicious software. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre said new cases of ransomware are possible “at a significant scale.” The so-called WannaCry attacks ""could serve as a wake-up call for many organizations and countries delaying a review of their cybersecurity hygiene,"" said Shaul Eyal, an analyst at Oppenheimer & Co., in a note to clients. A new version of the ransomware may have also been spreading over the weekend. Companies including Palo Alto Networks Inc., Symantec, Check Point Software Technologies Ltd., Cisco Systems Inc. and Oracle Corp. are others that are likely to benefit, according to Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. The $967 million PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF, or HACK, jumped the most in six months. Symantec rose as much as 5.3 percent, the most since August, to $32.65 in New York. Just last week the company reported revenue forecasts for the current quarter that missed analysts’ estimates. It has been struggling with falling sales of its Norton antivirus to consumers. Proofpoint Inc., rose as much as 8.9 percent to $87.32, its highest intraday price since November. The weekend’s attack, as well as President Trump’s Cybersecurity Executive Order, signed last week and aimed drawing attention to security improvements, are both incrementally positive for the cybersecurity sector, Ferragu said. Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, in a blog post Sunday, said the attack is a “wake-up call” for governments around the world. “This attack is a powerful reminder that information technology basics like keeping computers current and patched are a high responsibility for everyone, and it’s something every top executive should support.” He said the attack “demonstrates the degree to which cybersecurity has become a shared responsibility between tech companies and customers.” — With assistance by Dani Burger"
2017-05-17T11:30:42.739Z,British Cyber Cops Face Biggest Test After Worldwide Cyberattack,"Kit Chellel
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-17/british-cyber-cops-face-biggest-test-after-worldwide-cyberattack,"Days after the global cyber attack, U.K. police are trying to figure out whether it was an established network of criminals, state-backed hackers or bored teenagers that crippled the country’s health service. The malware campaign affected more than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries, locking users out of systems at Chinese government agencies, Deutsche Bahn, automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Renault, logistics giant FedEx Corp., and hospitals around the world. As security experts gain the upper hand in containing the infection, police have begun the hunt for its creators. “The response is beyond anything I’ve seen before,” said Steven Wilson, the head of Europol’s EC3 cyber crime unit. “The picture is starting to emerge slowly. This could be something that is going to take us a considerable period of time.” Finding and locking up hackers may be the toughest job in law enforcement. Criminals can use the darkweb -- the subterranean layer of the internet untouched by conventional search engines -- to disguise their activities, and make use of a complex online ecosystem of black market services that is global in nature. Suspects are often in Eastern Europe, Russia or other hard-to-reach jurisdictions for U.S. or European police. The U.K. and Russia were among the worst hit, making them the likely leaders in any investigation. “We are absolutely focused in finding out who the criminals behind this attack are,” said Lynne Owens, director general at the National Crime Agency, known as the U.K.’s FBI. “At this moment in time, we don’t know whether it’s a very sophisticated network or whether it’s a number of individuals working together,” Owens said in an interview posted on the agency’s website. Unlike being hacked by clicking on a malicious email or link, the “WannaCry” virus replicated itself, spreading for computer to computer automatically and demanding that computer users pay a ransom in bitcoin, an online currency that is extremely difficult to track. “It takes a colossal amount of time, resource, knowledge, skill and effort to look through all the data and follow it through all the encrypted steps,” said Brian Lord, a former director at the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency, GCHQ. Lord, now an executive at security firm PGI Cyber, said it takes “strategic patience” and that law enforcement agencies -- with all of their competing priorities and demands -- rarely had such qualities. This time it may be different, given the widespread damage caused by WannaCry, according to Thomas Brown, a former assistant U.S. attorney in New York who supervised a cyber crime unit. “The wealth of available evidence given the vast scope of the attack, as well as the fact that there will probably be very strong international cooperation in light of the huge number of affected countries (including Russia), indicate that the investigation will be extremely robust,” he said. The probe will likely feature a combination of high-tech evidence gathering and traditional gum shoe techniques, such as interviewing suspects and confidential sources, said Brown, a managing director at Berkeley Research Group. An NCA spokeswoman said the agency would use its international liaison officers, based in 120 countries, to work with overseas forces. Leading the NCA operation is Oliver Gower, a former civil servant who speaks fluent French and who has spend the past five years helping build a coordinated government response to cyber crime, according to his LinkedIn profile. “Cyber criminals may believe they are anonymous but we will use all the tools at our disposal to bring them to justice,” Gower said in a statement last week. The NCA has made progress in dismantling the online systems that distribute viruses, and recently arrested suspected cyber money launderers. Unlike U.S. authorities, it doesn’t have a track record of extraditing overseas hackers or, in one instance, seizing them while on holiday in the Maldives. The NCA’s cyber division is probably best known for an advertising campaign trying to dissuade teenagers from breaking computer laws. The NCA can also call on the U.K.’s new National Cyber Security Centre, a GCHQ division created last year to be the public face of the famously secretive data collection agency. The NCSC coordinated the immediate response to the ransonware attack, its first major incident. Over the weekend, the centre made contact with some of the world’s largest private cyber security companies, including Secureworks Corp. and FireEye Inc., compiling information about the ransomware and how to contain it. “This is the NCA’s biggest challenge to date,” said Alex Mendez, joint founder of Remora, a London-based computer security firm. The agency could potentially work together with other countries but in practice it can be hard to agree on operational actions due to the underlying political environment, he said. — With assistance by Jeremy Kahn"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-15/corporates-governments-fight-back-as-cyber-attack-spreads,"Governments and companies around the world began to gain the upper hand against the first wave of an unrivaled global cyberattack, even as the assault was poised to continue claiming victims this week.  More than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries have so far been infected, according to Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre said new cases of so-called ransomware are possible “at a significant scale.” ""For now, it does not look like the number of infected computers is increasing,"" said a Europol spokesman. ""We will get a decryption tool eventually, but for the moment, it’s still a live threat and we’re still in disaster recovery mode."" At Germany’s national Deutsche Bahn railroad, workers were laboring under ""high pressure"" Monday to repair remaining glitches with train stations’ electronic departure boards, a spokesman said. French car-maker Renault SA, which halted production at some factories to stop the virus from spreading, said 90 percent of factories worldwide had now resumed operations, according to a spokesman Monday. QuickTake Cybersecurity A new version of the ransomware may have also been spreading over the weekend. Matt Suiche, founder of United Arab Emirates-based cyber security firm Comae Technologies, said around 10,000 machines have been infected by the second variation of the malware. The malware used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. It affected the U.K.’s National Health Service, Russia’s Ministry of Interior, China government agencies, Deutsche Bahn, automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Renault, PetroChina, logistics giant FedEx Corp., and other company and hospital computer systems in countries from Eastern Europe to the U.S. and Asia. The hackers used the tool to encrypt files within affected computers, making them inaccessible, and demanded ransom -- typically $300 in bitcoin. Russia and Ukraine had a heavy concentration of infections, according to Dutch security company Avast Software BV. Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, in a blog post Sunday, said the attack is a “wake-up call” for governments in the U.S. and elsewhere to stop stockpiling tools to exploit digital vulnerabilities. “They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world,” he said. About 97 percent of U.K. facilities and doctors disabled by the attack were back to normal operation, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Saturday after a government meeting. At the height of the attack Friday and early Saturday, 48 organizations in the NHS were affected, and hospitals in London, North West England and Central England urged people with non-emergency conditions to stay away as technicians tried to stop the spread of the malicious software. The initial attack was stifled when a security researcher disabled a key mechanism used by the worm to spread, but experts said the hackers were likely to mount a second attack because so many users of personal computers with Microsoft operating systems couldn’t or didn’t download a security patch released in March that Microsoft had labeled “critical.” Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday that it was taking the “highly unusual“ step of providing the patch for older versions of Windows it was otherwise no longer supporting, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. While the scale of the attack shows Microsoft needs to strengthen its own capabilities, “there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their system,” Smith said in his blog post. “Otherwise they’re literally fighting the problems of the present with tools from the past. “This attack is a powerful reminder that information technology basics like keeping computers current and patched are a high responsibility for everyone, and it’s something every top executive should support."" The Good Guys Can Have the Upper Hand on Cybersecurity Victims have paid about $50,000 in ransom so far, with the total expected to rise, said Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a ransomware consultant that works with banks and companies in the U.K., U.S. and Europe. Robinson, in an interview by email, said he calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands. Last year an acute-care hospital in Hollywood paid $17,000 in bitcoin to an extortionist who hijacked its computer systems and forced doctors and staff to revert to pen and paper for record-keeping. A spokesman for Spain’s Telefonica SA said the hack affected some employees at its headquarters, but the phone company is attacked frequently and the impact of Friday’s incident wasn’t major. FedEx said it was “experiencing interference,” the Associated Press reported. Renault halted production at some factories to stop the virus from spreading, a spokesman said Saturday, while Nissan’s car plant in Sunderland, in northeast England, was affected without causing any major impact on business, an official said. Russia’s Interior Ministry, with oversight of the police forces, said about “1,000 computers were infected,” which it described as less than 1 percent of the total, according to its website. In China, the malware affected computers at “several” unspecified government departments, the country’s Cyberspace Administration said on its WeChat blog Monday. Since that initial attack, agencies and companies from the police to banks and communications firms have put preventive measures in place, while Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and other cybersecurity firms have begun making protection tools available, the internet overseer said. China National Petroleum Corp., which owns PetroChina, reported that some of its 21,000 gas stations had seen their digital payment systems disabled by the attack and resorted to accepting cash. More than 80 percent of the stations had been reconnected to the network as of noon on May 14, the company said. Several Chinese universities had also been hit by the attacks, according to local media reports. In Japan, Hitachi Ltd. said that some of its computers had been affected. In South Korea, CJ CGV Co., the country’s largest cinema chain, said advertising servers and displays at film theaters were hit by ransomware. Movie servers weren’t affected and are running as normal, it said in a text message Monday. Indonesia’s government reported two hospitals in Jakarta were affected. While any size company could be vulnerable, many large organizations with robust security departments would have prioritized the update that Microsoft released in March and wouldn’t be vulnerable to Friday’s attack. Ransomware is a particularly stubborn problem because victims are often tricked into allowing the malicious software to run on their computers, and the encryption happens too fast for security software to catch it. Some security experts calculate that ransomware may bring in as much as $1 billion a year in revenue for the attackers. The attack was apparently halted in the afternoon in the U.K. when a researcher took control of an Internet domain that acted as a kill switch for the worm’s propagation, according to Ars Technica. “I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental,” wrote the researcher, who uses the Twitter name @MalwareTechBlog. “So long as the domain isn’t revoked, this particular strain will no longer cause harm, but patch your systems ASAP as they will try again.” A second variant of the domain also became apparent. Suiche, founder of Comae Technologies, said on Sunday he registered another kill-switch for a different version of the ransomware. About 50% of machines that would have spread the infection by the second variation of the malware have Russian I.P. addresses, according to Suiche. There is a high probability that Russian-language cybercriminals were behind the attack, said Aleks Gostev, chief cybersecurity expert for Kaspersky Labs. “Ransomware is traditionally their topic,” he said. “The geography of attacks that hit post-Soviet Union most also suggests that.” — With assistance by Stepan Kravchenko, Ksenia Galouchko, Robert Hutton, Jack Sidders, Adam Satariano, Nour Al Ali, Aibing Guo, Penny Peng, and Aaron Ricadela"

The $967 million PureFunds ISE Cyber Security ETF, or HACK, jumped the most in six months. The malware unleashed late last week used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. It’s affecting companies including FedEx Corp. and government agencies like the U.K.’s National Health Service. More than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries have been infected, according to Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency. Last Thursday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order to focus attention on cybersecurity improvements. Along with the attack, “we see both of these events as incrementally positive for cybersecurity spend,” Pierre Ferragu, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., wrote in a note Monday. “The opinion of enterprise decision makers is heavily influenced by such events, and this one is likely to support spending decisions.” The HACK fund has benefited before from headline-grabbing online crime. The PureFunds ETF had one of the most successful debuts in history after investors poured $1.4 billion into the fund following a breach at Sony Pictures Entertainment. On Monday, the fund gained 3.2 percent to $30.69, the highest in almost two years, as of 10:03 a.m. in New York. FireEye -- the stock with the biggest weighting in HACK -- gained 6.8 percent.  The ransomware used by hackers encrypted files within affected computers, making them inaccessible, and demanded ransom -- typically $300 in bitcoin. After the first wave of attacks on Friday, bitcoin fell 7.1 percent, it’s biggest slide in almost two months. The digital currency pared some of those loses Monday, gaining 3.2 percent. U.K. health care services were among those hit, as health stocks dipped 0.8 percent during Monday trading. Yet losses were minimized as government agencies began to gain the upper hand. About 97 percent of U.K. facilities and doctors disabled by the attack were back to normal operation, U.K. Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Saturday after a government meeting. — With assistance by Stephen Sweeney"
2017-05-15T13:30:07.213Z,Ransomware and Direct Listings,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-15/ransomware-and-direct-listings,"The cyber. There is some chance that when you showed up to work this morning your computer was encrypted and demanded a $300 ransom to be decrypted, raising the fundamental question: Would you pay $300 to do your work? I assume that a lot of office workers looked at the ransom screen, chuckled ""you win this round computer,"" and headed right back out the door. But, right, a lot of cyberattacks: Perhaps the best thing to read about ransomware is this post by cryptography professor Matthew Green from February. Green points out the critical problem with ransomware -- with ransom, generally -- which is that, if a criminal locks up your computer and demands $300 in bitcoins to unlock it, you have no reason to trust him to actually unlock the computer if you pay the ransom. He is, after all, a criminal; he has not done a lot to build up trust with you. But he's getting paid in bitcoins. On the blockchain. The blockchain is of course the place where people go to transact without trusting each other. Once you have started down the blockchain path, the solution for your problem is obvious. What you need is a smart ransomware contract, one that can credibly and verifiably promise -- in software -- to decrypt your information if you follow its requirements (sending the ransom). There are some technical issues -- how can you verify that the software decrypts the files before it does it? -- but the concept is sound. And from there, madness: Do you worry at all that the cryptographic-economic focus on building trustless transaction systems will undermine trust? The value of market capitalism is not just that it allocates resources efficiently; it also creates a society in which we all rely on each other for our well-being. I don't grow my own food; I am connected to farmers by a largely invisible web of exchanges, of debits and credits. I rely on the farmers to grow the food I need, and the supermarket to stock it, and the bank to keep track of the money I use to pay for it. Over time, technology has improved all of these processes, but there has always been some residual need for trust that was not entirely susceptible to technological solution, some need for cooperation and belief in the system for that system to function.  The blockchain dream is about solving that problem. Why trust in banks when you can have a decentralized trustless monetary system? Why trust managers to run a business when you can have a decentralized autonomous organization? But this dream of getting rid of the need for trust in human interaction is not entirely benign. Bitcoin's appeal in criminal transactions -- drug deals, ransomware -- is not just that it's ""untraceable."" (It's pretty traceable!) There's a philosophical appeal, too: A trustless currency is good for people who don't trust each other, and who aren't trustworthy. The rise of bitcoin might make us all a bit more like that. Elsewhere: ""Bitcoin’s surge fuels fears of asset bubble."" And: ""Microsoft hits out at US government ‘stockpiling’ of cyber weapons."" Direct listing. Spotify AB is rumored to be thinking about going public by ""direct listing,"" where it just plops its stock on an exchange without bothering with the usual apparatus -- roadshow, bookbuilding, pricing -- of an initial public offering. Here is an argument for direct listing from Felix Salmon, who notes that ""it helps to marginalize Wall Street investment banks, for one thing, which is generally a good thing."" I am somewhat less convinced, though, disclosure, I used to be an equity capital markets banker.  But the start of trading seems hard, for a direct listing. After a regular IPO -- and the opening trade the next day -- the stock is in the hands of a lot of different unaffiliated investors who just want to trade it normally, and the stock will bounce around on a series of small trades that are fairly smoothly connected to each other by the usual mechanisms of the stock market. With a direct listing ... that might happen? Like, Spotify might announce that its stock will open for trading on a Tuesday, and on Tuesday morning a bunch of investors who want Spotify stock will put in market-on-open or limit-on-open orders to buy it, and a bunch of Spotify insiders who want to sell will put in orders to sell it, and the exchange's opening auction procedure will cross those orders and come to a clearing price for Spotify to start trading, and then a minute after the opening a bunch of regular investors will own the stock and be free to trade it around amongst themselves. But that is sort of an IPO by other means, and those means are much less well adapted to the goal. All those investors trying to buy will have to do so without any marketing effort from the company, or any analysis from banks. All those insiders thinking about selling will have to do so with no coordinated idea of who else is selling. And everyone on both sides will have to make their decisions without much idea of what the clearing price will be. I mean, they'll have some idea -- the NYSE and Nasdaq opening auctions give traders indications of the clearing price -- but not much. The exchanges start giving indicative opening prices at 9:28 a.m., for a 9:30 opening, giving investors two minutes of price discovery. IPO roadshows -- in which banks and investors and companies figure out the opening price for the company's stock -- can last weeks, and even after that the opening auction can be a mess. The transition from ""not trading"" to ""trading"" is not smooth and automatic; it requires some sort of auction, some sort of coordination of buying and selling interest. Most stocks don't trade (much) between 4 p.m. and 9:30 a.m., and so exchanges run auctions every morning to effect the transition from ""not trading for the night"" to ""trading for the day."" The transition from ""not trading ever"" to ""trading from now on"" seems like a bigger shift, and one that would require a bigger coordination process. That's why IPOs happen the way they do: to coordinate that sharp transition in an organized way. Or maybe you wouldn't have a big sharp transition on the first day of listing: Maybe few investors will buy, or few investors will sell. That will make the stock very volatile, perhaps for months: Any insider looking to sell, any institution looking to buy, will swamp the existing supply of stock and move the price dramatically. The stock price won't reflect fundamentals; it will reflect the weird dynamics of doing a weird quasi-IPO.  Still I like the idea of direct listing, even though I am not sure it's a great practical tool for many companies. It is a good conceptual response to a world in which private markets are the new public markets, and in which public companies are largely engaged in the business of returning capital to shareholders. If companies don't need to go public to raise money, it is odd that they more or less always go public by raising money. It seems weird to make such a big deal of IPOs, or to pay banks a lot of money to run them. Why not just check a box saying ""we're public now"" and be done with it? You can sort of think of the postmodern corporate life cycle as: In that model, step 3 starts to feel like a vestigial appendage. It is just a matter of timing and convenience. At lots of private companies, early investors can cash out by selling their shares in private transactions to new investors, or to the company itself. And plenty of companies go straight from Step 2 to Step 4: They raise money, build businesses, and return money to shareholders without ever going public. It wouldn't be all that surprising if that one day became the norm for unicorns too. Direct listings -- going public, but not caring very much about it -- are a step in that direction. X-accounts. Elsewhere in bookbuilding, here's a funny story about bond offerings in China: That sort of happens everywhere -- capital markets bankers usually assume that investors inflate their demand on hot deals in order to get good allocations -- but it is particularly noteworthy in Chinese deals in which investors place anonymous ""x-orders"" with one bank in the syndicate, so that that bank gets credit for the order when the company pays underwriting fees: Stories like this are the result of taking literally financial practices that have become dead metaphors in the West. In theory, underwriters everywhere are paid for going out and finding investors to buy bonds. But in practice, underwriting fees in the U.S. are about relationships and advice and lending and reputation and many other things; the actual process of going out and finding orders is thought to more or less take care of itself. But in the Chinese market, companies say, well, okay, we are paying you to find buyers for our bonds; whoever finds the most buyers will get paid the most. Passive investing. One widely discussed fact about the rise of indexing is that, as people say, ""passive isn't passive."" Buying an S&P 500 index fund doesn't relieve you of the need to make decisions: By buying the S&P 500, you've decided to buy large-cap stocks instead of small ones, and U.S. stocks instead of foreign ones, and stocks instead of bonds, and something instead of nothing. Choosing one index (one asset class, geography, etc.) over another could lead to higher or lower returns, as could choosing when to buy the index. Active decision-making is still required. You just avoid the problem of picking which companies to buy. That problem is now less complicated than the problem of picking which index to buy: ""The number of market indexes now exceeds the number of U.S. stocks.""  You can sort of decompose investing into two parts:  Those two activities are closely connected: Analyzing a company requires thinking about the future of its industry and the economy, while analyzing economic trends requires some understanding of how companies make money. But the top-down work of predicting economic and social trends, and the bottom-up work of analyzing corporate financial statements, are different activities, which will appeal to different personalities and require different skill sets. Intuitively, the top-down theorizing about economic trends seems like it would be more appealing to hobbyists? I mean, not necessarily -- if you love the careful detailed work of building model trains, you might enjoy reading 10-Ks! -- but it does seem a little easier to have a casual half-informed view about the effect of social media on society than about the price-earnings ratio of Twitter's stock. The profusion of indexes provides new ways to turn ideas into investments, while hiding the mechanics of how those ideas translate into companies. If you think the big economic story is the rise of China, you can go buy a Rise of China Index Fund, without analyzing the operations of hundreds of companies to see which are most exposed to China. The index creators are giving people what they want, but what they want might not be passivity, exactly.  People are worried that people aren't worried enough. I tell you, after laboring for years in the mines of ""people are worried about bond market liquidity"" without ever seeing it quite break into the big time, I am continually impressed by how far ""people are worried that people aren't worried enough"" has come in such a short time. It is everywhere! Here at Bloomberg View, Mohamed El-Erian worries that ""Unusually Low Volatility Can Be Dangerous for Markets"": Another Bloomberg View colleague, Tyler Cowen, considers other feedback loops: At CNBC, Michael Santoli has ""3 reasons why Trump drama isn't rattling the bull market"": And at the Financial Times, Robin Wigglesworth talks to brokers and traders about how worried they are about the lack of worry: They have no time for lunch because there's so little to do!  People are worried about unicorns. Here's a reason to worry about Uber Technologies Inc.: Alphabet Inc.'s Waymo unit is teaming up with Lyft Inc. to work on self-driving cars.  ""Lyft is a ride-hailing company that is not Uber,"" a Waymo spokesperson said. Wait no that is not what Waymo said -- they said ""Lyft’s vision and commitment to improving the way cities move will help Waymo’s self-driving technology reach more people, in more places"" -- but it is probably what they meant. Waymo is suing Uber for allegedly stealing its self-driving-car technology, and teaming up with Lyft seems like another way for Alphabet to twist the knife. Things happen.

2017-05-12T23:59:32.817Z,"Hospitals Gain Control After Ransom Hack, More Attacks May Come","Jordan Robertson
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-12/ransom-hack-racking-up-victims-with-hospitals-most-at-risk,"Most U.K. health facilities whose computer systems were crippled in a global cyber-attack are back to normal operation, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said, even as experts warned that hackers would probably launch a new round of attacks with many computers still vulnerable. About 97 percent of facilities and doctors affected are able to work normally, Rudd said Saturday after a U.K. government meeting. At the height of the attack Friday and early Saturday, 48 organizations in the National Health Service were affected, and hospitals in London, North West England and Central England urged people with non-emergency conditions to stay away as technicians tried to stop the spread of the malicious software. “There will be lessons to learn from what appears to be the biggest criminal cyber-attack in history,” Rudd said in response to a letter from Jonathan Ashworth, the shadow secretary of state for health. The malware, using a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency, also affected Russia’s Ministry of Interior, Germany’s Deutsche Bahn rail system, automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA, logistics giant FedEx Corp., and other company and hospital computer systems in countries from Eastern Europe to the U.S. and Asia. More than 75,000 computers in 99 countries were compromised, with a heavy concentration of infections in Russia and Ukraine, according to Dutch security company Avast Software BV. The hackers used the tool to encrypt files within affected computers, making them inaccessible, and demanded ransom -- typically $300 in bitcoin. The initial attack was stifled when a security researcher disabled a key mechanism used by the worm to spread, but experts said the hackers were likely to mount a second attack because so many users of personal computers with Microsoft Corp. operating systems couldn’t or didn’t download a security patch released in March that Microsoft had labeled “critical.” Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday that it was taking the “highly unusual“ step of providing the patch for older versions of Windows it was otherwise no longer supporting, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. The Good Guys Can Have the Upper Hand on Cybersecurity Victims have paid about $30,000 in ransom so far, with the total expected to rise substantially next week, said Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a ransomware consultant that works with banks and companies in the U.K., U.S. and Europe. Robinson, in an interview by email, said he calculated the total based on payments tracked to Bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands. Last year an acute-care hospital in Hollywood paid $17,000 in bitcoin to an extortionist who hijacked its computer systems and forced doctors and staff to revert to pen and paper for record-keeping. Hospitals are also fertile ground for identity thieves because of their often-lax security policies. Bloomberg Businessweek wrote in 2015 about a spate of malware infections at hospitals where radiological machines, blood-gas analyzers and other devices were compromised and used to siphon off the personal data of patients. A spokesman for Spain’s Telefonica SA said the hack affected some employees at its headquarters, but the phone company is attacked frequently and the impact of Friday’s incident wasn’t major. FedEx said it was “experiencing interference,” the Associated Press reported. Renault halted production at some factories to stop the virus from spreading, a spokesman said Saturday, while Nissan’s U.K. car plant in Sunderland, in northeast England, was affected without causing any major impact on business, an official said. In Germany, Deutsche Bahn faced “technical disruptions” on electronic displays at train stations, but travel was unaffected, the company said in a statement on its website. Newspaper reports showed images of a ransomware message on display screens blocking train information. Russia’s Interior Ministry, with oversight of the police forces, said about “1,000 computers were infected,” which it described as less than 1 percent of the total, according to its website. While any sized company could be vulnerable, many large organizations with robust security departments would have prioritized the update that Microsoft released in March and wouldn’t be vulnerable to Friday’s attack. Ransomware is a particularly stubborn problem because victims are often tricked into allowing the malicious software to run on their computers, and the encryption happens too fast for security software to catch it. Some security expects calculate that ransomware may bring in as much as $1 billion a year in revenue for the attackers. The attack was apparently halted in the afternoon in the U.K. when a researcher took control of an Internet domain that acted as a kill switch for the worm’s propagation, according to Ars Technica. “I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental,” wrote the researcher, who uses the Twitter name @MalwareTechBlog. “So long as the domain isn’t revoked, this particular strain will no longer cause harm, but patch your systems ASAP as they will try again.” There is a high-probability that Russian-language cybercriminals were behind the attack, said Aleks Gostev, chief cybersecurity expert for Kaspersky Labs. “Ransomware is traditionally their topic,” he said. “The geography of attacks that hit post-Soviet Union most also suggests that.” — With assistance by Stepan Kravchenko, Ksenia Galouchko, Robert Hutton, Jack Sidders, and Adam Satariano"
2017-05-16T00:09:42.169Z,Microsoft Faulted Over Ransomware While Shifting Blame to NSA,"Dina Bass
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-16/microsoft-faulted-over-ransomware-while-shifting-blame-to-nsa,"There’s a blame game brewing over who’s responsible for the massive cyberattack that infected hundreds of thousands of computers. Microsoft Corp. is pointing its finger at the U.S. government, while some experts say the software giant is accountable too.The attack started Friday and has affected computers in more than 150 countries, including severe disruptions at Britain’s National Health Service. The hack used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency to target Microsoft’s market-leading Windows operating system. It effectively takes the computer hostage and demands a $300 ransom, to be paid in 72 hours with bitcoin. QuickTake How Ransomware Works Microsoft President and Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith blamed the NSA’s practice of developing hacking methods to use against the U.S. government’s own enemies. The problem is that once those vulnerabilities become public, they can be used by others. In March, thousands of leaked Central Intelligence Agency documents exposed vulnerabilities in smartphones, televisions and software built by Apple Inc., Google and Samsung Electronics Co. The argument that it’s the NSA’s fault has merit, according to Alex Abdo, staff attorney at the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. Still, he said Microsoft should accept some responsibility.  “Technology companies owe their customers a reliable process for patching security vulnerabilities,” he said. “When a design flaw is discovered in a car, manufacturers issue a recall. Yet, when a serious vulnerability is discovered in software, many companies respond slowly or say it’s not their problem.'” Microsoft released a patch for the flaw in March after hackers stole the exploit from the NSA. But some organizations didn’t apply it, and others were running older versions of Windows that Microsoft no longer supports. In what it said was a  “highly unusual” step, Microsoft also agreed to provide the patch for older versions of Windows, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.  In 2014, Microsoft ended support for the highly popular Windows XP, released in 2001 and engineered beginning in the late 1990s, arguing that the software was out of date and wasn't built with modern security safeguards.  The company had already been supporting it longer than it normally would have because so many customers still used it and the effort was proving costly. Security patches would be available for clients with older machines, but only if they paid for custom support agreements. But with Microsoft making an exception this time and providing the patch free to XP users, it may come under pressure to do the same next time it issues a critical security update. (These are the most important patches that the company recommends users install immediately). That could saddle the company with the XP albatross for many years past when it hoped to be free from having to maintain the software. The precedent may impact other software sellers too. “They’re going to end up going above and beyond and some vendors are going to start extending support for out-of-support things that they haven’t done before,” said Greg Young, an analyst at market research firm Gartner Inc. “That’s going to become a more common practice.”On Monday,  private-sector sleuths found a clue about potentially who’s responsible for the WannaCrypt attack.  A researcher from Google posted on Twitter that an early version of WannaCrypt from February shared some of the same programming code as malicious software used by the Lazarus Group, the alleged North Korean government hackers behind the destructive attack on Sony Corp. in 2014 and the theft of $81 million from a Bangladesh central bank account at the New York Fed last year. Others subsequently confirmed the Google researcher’s work.On its own, the shared code is little more than an intriguing lead. Once malicious software is in the wild, it is commonly reused by hacking groups, especially nation-states trying to leave the fingerprints of another country. But in this case, according to Kaspersky Lab, the shared code was removed from the versions of WannaCrypt that are currently circulating, which reduces the likelihood of such a ‘false flag’ attempt at misdirection. Some security researchers speculated that if the perpetrators were North Korean, the goal may have been to cause a widespread internet outage to coincide with this weekend’s latest missile test. As for Microsoft, some intelligence agency experts questioned its NSA criticism, saying it’s unreasonable for the company to ask governments to stop using its products as a way to attack and monitor enemies. “For Microsoft to say that governments should stop developing exploits to Microsoft products is naive,” said Brian Lord, a managing director at PGI Cyber and former deputy director at the Government Communications Headquarters, one of the U.K.’s intelligence agencies. “To keep the world safe these things have to be done.” He said that intelligence agencies tended to be good and responsible stewards of the hacks and exploits they develop. “Occasionally mistakes happen,” he added. --With assistance from Gerrit De Vynck and Jeremy Kahn"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-15/five-things-you-need-to-know-to-start-your-day-j2qnk6ve,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. Saudi Arabia and Russia lift oil prices, global cyber-attack abating, and China gobbles up U.S. debt. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. West Texas Intermediate futures rose as much as 3.8 percent after energy ministers from Saudi Arabia and Russia said agreed-upon production curbs from OPEC and other major oil producers should be extended through the first quarter of 2018. Crude’s advance may have caused some consternation in the hedge fund community: This group recently unwound the bullish bets they placed on an oil rally since the OPEC deal was reached last year. Petrocurrencies fared well, as the Canadian dollar was the best-performing G10 currency after positioning data released last week showed a record number of loonie bears. The worst of this ransomware attack looks to have passed. European authorities claim  the number of infected computers doesn’t look to be increasing, while U.K. politicians said the overwhelming majority of companies affected by the malware had returned to normal operations. However, experts warn that governments should be on alert for a potential wave of these kinds of attacks. One reason why the hackers may not have gotten all they bargained for in ransom payments? Using bitcoin is hard. Meanwhile, a flight to cyber-safety saw companies that provide software security services advance on Monday. China boosted its holdings of U.S. debt by $27.9 billion in March, according to a monthly report from the Treasury Department released on Monday. Belgium, often seen as an additional proxy for Chinese demand for Treasuries, saw its holdings rise to $109 billion. These purchases help reverse the increasing domestic dominance of the U.S. Treasury market and allay fears of risk appetite potentially being dented by Chinese sales of American debt. That kind of sentiment reportedly contributed to the carnage in equities following the shock devaluation of the yuan in August 2015. Chinese reserves have risen for three consecutive months through April. The S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index posted fresh records, with materials, financials, and energy stocks rising the most. Homebuilders rallied more than 1 percent amid optimism demand will keep picking up. With the U.S. dollar in retreat and Treasury yields edging higher, the risk-on sentiment spanned asset classes Monday. The Japanese yen was the weakest G10 currency Monday, offering a tailwind for Japanese equities. Indeed, Nikkei 225 and S&P/ASX equity futures are pointing to a higher open on Tuesday as of  5:30 a.m. Tokyo time. Asian shares rose to open the week as President Xi Jinping’s enormous spending plans outweighed largely soft readings on economic activity for April. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."
2017-05-15T11:48:27.973Z,Ransomware Attack Shows Threat of Cyber War Crimes,"Leonid Bershidsky
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-15/ban-cyberweapons-that-target-civilian-infrastructure,"Last week's ransomware attack that brought down MRI scanners in the U.K., railroad ticket machines in Germany, interior ministry computers in Russia and parts of the FedEx network in the U.S. is bound to cause a backlash against spy agencies' cyberwarfare capabilities. It shows that services such as the U.S. National Security Agency hoard weapons that, by their very nature, target civilian infrastructure. The WannaCry attack wasn't a big-time nation state operation, though it's likely that it may have originated in Russia. Last year, 75 percent of crypto ransomware -- malware that encrypts files on the target machine to force its owner to pay a ransom in exchange for their decryption -- originated from the Russian-speaking hacker underworld. The largest number of WannaCry attacks occurred in Russia and Ukraine. The hackers here weren't playing some political interference game: They were after money, in bitcoin. Researchers who tracked the bitcoin addresses hardwired into the malware found that tens of thousands of dollars had been paid before the spread of the virus was halted by a cybersecurity expert who accidentally found a flaw in WannaCry. That flaw, apparently the result of the hackers' rather clumsy attempt to prevent their malware from being analyzed, shows the attack wasn't highly sophisticated. Its main element was developed by the NSA, not the hackers -- a vulnerability codenamed Eternalblue, which allowed the agency to commandeer old, pre-Windows 10 versions of the Microsoft operating system. The NSA code was released in April by a hacking group calling itself Shadow Brokers, which had apparently failed to find a buyer for a large trove of NSA cyberweapons. After the recent leaks of hacking tools from the NSA and the Central Intelligence Agency, cyberespionage critics, including NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden and WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange, have criticized the agencies for hoarding vulnerabilities for their own use instead of flagging them to companies like Microsoft in the interest of public safety. Following the WannaCry attack, one of the biggest in history, Microsoft itself has joined the ranks of the critics. In a strongly worded blog post, Brad Smith, the company's president and chief legal officer, wrote: Repeatedly, exploits in the hands of governments have leaked into the public domain and caused widespread damage. An equivalent scenario with conventional weapons would be the U.S. military having some of its Tomahawk missiles stolen. And this most recent attack represents a completely unintended but disconcerting link between the two most serious forms of cybersecurity threats in the world today – nation-state action and organized criminal action. Microsoft and its peers shouldn't count on the NSA to hand over information about vulnerabilities; spies will be spies. Given the current regulatory environment, it's the responsibility of these companies themselves, with their enormous financial resources, to track down these gaps in the security of their products, paying to acquire information if necessary.  Smith, however, is right when he calls for a ""Digital Geneva Convention"" that would protect civilians against nation-states' cyberwars, just as the Fourth Geneva Convention defends civilians in time of conventional war.  How did the NSA plan to use Eternalblue in the first place is a good question.  The fact that it only works against old Windows systems shows that it is specifically directed against civilian infrastructure, such as public sector networks that are often administered cheaply, by overworked and less qualified information technology professionals, on obsolete hardware, with software that won't run on Windows 10.  The newest version of the Microsoft operating system now holds just 26 percent of the global market. The share of Windows 7, released in 2009, is 48.5 percent and 7 percent of the world's internet-connected computers still use 16-year-old Windows XP. No matter how Microsoft pushes the newest system to customers (the upgrades are free), some systems stick with the old versions, simply because they can't afford the switching effort in terms of the time required and the old hardware's insufficiency. Expensive MRI machines used by the British National Health Service are a good example; medical equipment everywhere is likely to run antiquated systems -- and it's exposed to attacks delivered through the internet. The Russian interior ministry's computers affected by the WannaCry virus aren't military-use machines; they're old computers in police stations and service centers, the ones that are always the last to get an upgrade. For the German railroads, too, switching all the ticket terminals to Windows 10 is not exactly a priority. It's easy to say everyone should be vigilant, install every patch released and, preferably, never miss an operating system update. Certainly many institutions and companies underinvest in this area. These civilian systems, however, will always lag behind -- and that's why the NSA thinks old Windows vulnerabilities are worth hoarding. It's tempting for an intelligence service to find ways to shut down an adversary's power grid or hospital system, or to hack traffic lights in a big city to cause chaos. But that's as unethical as shooting or torturing the civilians in war. It should be illegal to develop such weapons, just as it is to produce nerve gas for military uses. Intelligence agencies should be legally required to give up any cyberweapons that don't specifically target the military capabilities of adversary states.  It would be naive to believe that would rule out the use of such cyberweapons. But it will improve intelligence services' accountability and, at the very least, force them to take better care of any dark stuff that comes into their hands. As it is, if they have a piece of malware, it's highly likely that even small-time criminals will have it, too.

2017-05-15T03:40:05.150Z,Japan Wakes Up to Global 'Ransomware' Cyberattack,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-15/japan-wakes-up-to-global-ransomware-cyberattack,"Tokyo (AP) -- The global ""ransomware"" cyberattack hit computers at 600 locations in Japan, but appeared to cause no major problems as Japanese started their workday Monday even as the attack caused chaos elsewhere. Nissan Motor Co. confirmed some units had been targeted, but there was no major impact on its business. Hitachi spokeswoman Yuko Tainiuchi said emails were slow or not getting delivered, and files could not be opened. The company believes the problems are related to the ransomware attack, although no ransom appears to have been demanded so far. They were installing software to fix the problems. The Japan Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center, a nonprofit providing support for computer attacks, said 2,000 computers at 600 locations in Japan were reported affected so far, citing an affiliate foreign security organization that it cannot identify. At least one hospital was affected, according to police. The city of Osaka said its home page suddenly went blank, although email and other problems had not been detected. ""We cannot confirm why this happened, and we are in the middle of investigating,"" said Hajime Nishikawa of the city hall's IT division. The attack, known as ""WannaCry,"" paralyzed computers that run Britain's hospital network, Germany's national railway and other companies and government agencies worldwide in what may be the largest online extortion scheme ever. Japanese Twitter users posted complaints about their computers shutting down and posted photos of the ransom demands on their computer screens. The attack held users hostage by freezing their computers, popping up a red screen with the words, ""Oops, your files have been encrypted!"" and demanding money through online bitcoin payment — $300 at first, rising to $600 before it destroys files hours later. Eiichi Moriya, a cyber security expert and professor at Meiji University, said that most major Japanese companies have already set up safeguards or a ""patch"" and should avert the attack, so that damage in Japan should be limited compared to other countries. He noted that many payments were already being made, but warned that paying the ransom did not ensure any fix, and suggested people keep data backups as the attack causes encryptions. ""You are dealing with a criminal,"" he said. ""It's like after a robber enters your home. You can change the locks but what has happened cannot be undone. If someone kidnaps your child, you may pay your ransom but there is no guarantee your child will return."" ___ Follow Yuri Kageyama on Twitter at twitter.com/yurikageyama Her work can be found at https://www.apnews.com/search/yuri%20kageyama"
2017-05-16T13:30:47.729Z,Hedge-Fund Pay and Trader Lies,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-16/hedge-fund-pay-and-trader-lies,"Hedge-fund pay. Institutional Investor's Alpha's annual ""Rich List of the World's Top-Earning Hedge Fund Managers"" is out today, and as usual the best-paid hedge-fund manager in 2016 was Warren Buffett, who made about $13.7 billion for the year. He earned it: His fund -- Berkshire Hathaway Inc. -- returned 23 percent in 2016, versus about a 12 percent total return for the S&P 500 index.  Actually wait no, Alpha's list starts with James Simons of Renaissance Technologies, who made only $1.6 billion. (He also had a good year.) Buffett is for some reason not on the list. Perhaps that is because he no longer manages a hedge fund? (Berkshire is a public company, and Buffett got out of the hedge fund business in 1969.) But Simons doesn't either; he retired at the end of 2010. Perhaps it is because Buffett's $13.7 billion in 2016 earnings wasn't actually ""pay"" at all; it's just appreciation on the Berkshire stock that he already owned? But that is also true for Simons, and for most of Alpha's list, which includes earnings on the managers' own capital in their funds as part of their ""pay."" We talk about this every year. (Here are the versions for 2013, 2014 and 2015.) The ""Rich List,"" as its title suggests, ranks rich hedge-fund managers. (And rich former hedge-fund managers still closely associated with their funds, like Simons, or like David Shaw, ranked number 9 this year, who founded D.E. Shaw Group but ""is no longer actively involved in their day-to-day operations."") If you are very rich, and you run a hedge fund, and you keep billions of dollars of your own money in the fund (as one does), and it has positive returns -- even small positive returns -- then you will make a lot of money. But that is not compensation for your hedge-fund-managing, good or bad; it's return on capital. The best-paid job in the world, year after year, is being a billionaire. But every year the discussion of the list suggests otherwise. ""Even the lowest-ranking manager on Alpha magazine’s expanded top-50 list made more money in 2016 than any big United States bank executive,"" reports the New York Times, incorrectly. Lloyd Blankfein owns 2.7 million shares of Goldman Sachs Group Inc., which were up about $158 million in 2016; add $7 million of dividends and his $22 million in official compensation and you get about $187 million, putting him easily into the top 25. Jamie Dimon's numbers at JPMorgan Chase & Co. -- 10.4 million shares (including options), almost $210 million in capital gain, $19 million in dividends and $27 million in reported compensation -- put him at about $256 million; the cutoff for the top 10 hedge-fund managers is $410 million. Of course we don't usually think about a bank chief executive officer's stock price appreciation as compensation, but if a hedge-fund manager's returns on his own capital count as pay, then so should the bank CEO's. Anyway the big picture is that pay, or ""pay,"" was down this year, in line with performance generally being down. Only two managers -- Simons and Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates -- cracked a billion dollars, versus five last year. The cutoff for the top 50 was just $30 million dollars. ""Some of the best-known names in the industry — including William A. Ackman, John A. Paulson and Edward S. Lampert — failed to make the list."" A small percentage return on a lot of money is a lot of money, but a negative return on a lot of money is still negative. Litvaking. A thing that apparently happens a lot, or at least used to happen a lot, is that bond traders lie to their customers about the price that they paid for bonds, in order to induce the customers to pay more for the bonds. ""Ugh, it is killing me to sell you these bonds at 77, I paid 76.99 for them, I'm barely making any money,"" the bond trader will say, even though she really bought the bonds for like 74 and is making tons of money. You can tell that this happens a lot because the traders keep getting arrested, or sued by the Securities and Exchange Commission, or at least fined by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority. It happens so much, in fact, that the customers are catching on. Yesterday the SEC brought civil charges against the former heads of Nomura's commercial mortgage-backed securities desk, James Im and Kee Chan. On one trade, Chan allegedly told a customer (""Trader B"") that he had bid 51-05 for some bonds and ended up buying them at 52, and that he would sell them to the customer for 52 plus an additional spread to compensate him for the work. (He had actually paid 51-01.) The customer agreed, but grumbled: They were ""certain"" that Chan ""made up"" his bid! They knew that he was lying, but they paid him anyway. The SEC cites this as evidence that Chan's lies were material to the customer, but it sounds a bit like the reverse: It sounds like Chan's customers grudgingly accepted that they were in a used-car-dealing world in which dealers lie about their profit margins, and there wasn't much they could do about it. ""im trying to get paid a scrap,"" Chan told a counterparty in another trade, sounding like a stereotype of a used car dealer. The customers may not have taken this sort of hyperbole all that seriously. They traded mortgage bonds all day; they perhaps had an inkling that some of the traders were lying. On the other hand, they did ask, and Chan put them off by doing this: Where have I seen that before? Jesse Litvak, the former Jefferies LLC managing director who was the first person prosecuted for this sort of thing, was convicted of lying to customers and sentenced to two years in prison, but then had his conviction reversed on appeal and sent back for a new trial where he could argue to a jury that everyone lies to customers so it's no big deal. So he did, and he mostly convinced the jury -- except that they were bothered that he had altered a chat transcript to make his lies to a customer more convincing, and convicted him of fraud for that. He was re-sentenced to the same two years in prison. Meanwhile, Chan settled with the SEC for about $214,000 in fines and disgorgement (and a three-year industry ban), without admitting or denying the charges; Im is fighting the charges. Incidentally, I say ""bond traders lie to their customers,"" but all of the cases so far are about mortgage-backed securities. (Residential mortgages for Litvak, and most of the others so far; commercial mortgages here.) Corporate bond traders don't lie to their customers about how much they paid for bonds, or at least they don't get in trouble for it. There's a reason for that, and it's not the innate honesty of corporate bond traders. It's that corporate bond trades in the U.S. are generally reported to Finra's TRACE system, so their prices are publicly available. If a dealer buys a corporate bond for 50 and then tells a customer that she paid 52, the customer can just look on TRACE to see that she's lying. So you don't see a lot of lying, or successful lying anyway. Meanwhile in commercial mortgage-backed securities, anything goes. The SEC's press release says that ""Im and Chan operated under cover of an opaque CMBS secondary market to gain illegal trading profits,"" but the word ""opaque"" here pretty much just means ""not TRACE eligible."" If bond dealers were required to publicly report the prices of CMBS trades, then they'd have no opportunity to lie about them. You get the sense that that's what the SEC wants. But actually doing the notice-and-comment rulemaking for post-trade transparency in the CMBS market would be a complicated endeavor for the SEC. It's easier to do the rulemaking by enforcement, to mandate honesty by suing a few traders instead of mandating transparency with a rule. Break up the banks! The Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 was a law forbidding commercial banks from doing investment banking, and vice versa. It was more or less dead by the end of the 1990s, with big universal banks combining banking and securities businesses. After the financial crisis of 2008, many people argued -- on sketchy evidence -- that the repeal of Glass-Steagall contributed to the crisis, and that we needed some sort of ""21st Century Glass-Steagall Act"" to break up the universal banks and make them safer and less crash-prone. And since Donald Trump likes to say words that people like to hear, he has echoed those suggestions: But, while Trump likes to say popular words, he does not seem to care about their meaning, and so Max Abelson reports that no one thinks that his ""21st century"" approach to Glass-Steagall will involve breaking up the banks, or separating commercial and investment banking, or otherwise doing anything related to the Glass-Steagall Act. Instead it will just be about bank deregulation: Hey great yes. Sure, right, improved. Uh-huh. Repealing Glass-Steagall was a deregulatory move, but bringing back a new Glass-Steagall will also be deregulatory. Meanwhile larger banks will also get regulatory relief in the form of a rollback of the Volcker Rule. It will all be Glass-Steagall! Glass-Steagall could mean taking principal trading activities out of commercial banks, or putting them back in, or whatever. ""Glass-Steagall"" means doing a thing about banks, and declaring it good.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain. I am a big fan of Ethereum, the smart-contract blockchain platform that has allowed a lot of innovation in ... well, Ponzi schemes? Think about it. The criteria for an early-adopter smart-contract application are pretty much: A Ponzi scheme is perfect, and so, when we first talked about Ethereum, I went to its app store and quickly found a Ponzi scheme, a chain-letter scheme, and two pyramid schemes. (Later we talked about the Distributed Autonomous Organization on Ethereum, which was not a Ponzi scheme, but which did get hilariously hacked.) These schemes were all pretty open about what they were! One innovation of the blockchain is that you can just say that your Ponzi scheme is a Ponzi scheme, and people will buy in anyway, because, you know, innovation. And because at a certain point the sort of paranoid skepticism that brings you to trustless solutions like the blockchain circles back into naivety.  The latest Ethereum Ponzi scheme is called PonzICO, and it is especially open about being a Ponzi scheme, but it comes with a charming white paper (on Medium or, much better, as a PDF): ""As a double bonus, if everyone stays irrational it might greatly enrich the author, providing future funding for blockchain performance art."" The great art project of our age is to entirely collapse the distinctions between ""fraud"" and ""performance art,"" so that one day mortgage-bond traders will be able to say ""wait, no, I wasn't lying about bond prices to increase my bonus, I was performing a metafictional narrative about bond-price negotiations in order to problematize the underlying foundations of bond trading in late capitalism.""  Elsewhere: ""Fed's Kashkari: blockchain has more potential than bitcoin itself."" I mean, for comedy, sure. A proxy fight. I have no idea what is going on at Cypress Semiconductor Corp., but it's more fun that way. Just cast your eyes over this proxy filing from T.J. Rodgers, Cypress's former chief executive officer, who was pushed out in 2016 and who is now running a proxy fight against the board. ""The Board’s lawyers have 'spun' my efforts to get at the truth on behalf of all Cypress stockholders as a 'personal vendetta' against executive chairman Ray Bingham,"" writes Rodgers. Then check out this press release from the board: I don't know if this is true or what they are fighting about or who should win or anything. My point is only that all proxy fights should be like this. Like if you are going to mount an insurgent campaign against a corporate board of directors, you should first have to have dinner with the directors and yell at them to their faces, and then the proxy statements should contain conflicting accounts of what you said.  An embezzlement. Here is a story about a former Bank of America Corp. wealth manager who possesses the glorious name Palestine ""Pam"" Ace, but who nonetheless allegedly turned to crime: According to prosecutors, the money came out of Bank of America's marketing budget, and came back to Ace and her co-conspirators in the form of personal checks (what?) or ""to a Bank of America account, to which the defendants had access."" Honestly if I were a nonprofit extorted in this way I would mostly be ... confused? I have only an amateur interest in bribery, but my understanding is that the way it works is that you first negotiate the bribe, then give out your employer's money. Giving out Bank of America money to nonprofits and then demanding bribes seems kind of backwards. People are worried that people aren't worried enough. ""Should We Fear the Stock Market’s Lack of Fear?"" asks the Wall Street Journal's Streetwise column. ""Fear Not the Fear of Complacency in Markets"" responds the Wall Street Journal's Heard on the Street column. I am glad we have settled that, I think. People are worried about unicorns. Well Uber Technologies Inc. keeps being worrying. The latest bad news is that a federal judge has enjoined Anthony Levandowski -- an engineer whom Uber poached from Alphabet Inc. and who allegedly stole a bunch of secrets on his way out -- from working on Uber's self-driving cars. Things could always be worse, though: ""Despite the judge’s ruling on Mr. Levandowski, Uber also had cause for celebration because its self-driving research program was not shut down, which would have been a more serious blow.""

A barrel of West Texas Intermediate for June delivery was trading more than a dollar higher at $49.05 by 5:21 a.m. Eastern Time. The jump comes after Saudi Arabia and Russia said at a joint press conference in Beijing that they favor prolonging curbs on the output of global producers through the end of the first quarter of 2018. Also in China, Wang Yilin, Chairman of China National Petroleum Corp., said the country will import more crude oil and natural gas from the U.S.  The cyber-attack which breached systems across the planet and forced U.K. hospitals to turn away patients on Friday is continuing to claim victims as people switch on their computers after the weekend. In the U.S., President Donald Trump asked his homeland security adviser to convene two emergency meetings on the threat posed by the hack.  German Chancellor Angela Merkel's Christian Democratic Union had an unexpectedly strong victory in elections in the country's most populous region yesterday. Her party took 34 percent of the vote, with the rival SPD taking less than 31 percent, its worst showing since World War II. The win is a boost for Merkel ahead of September's federal election. Also yesterday, Emmanuel Macron became the youngest ever president of France, promising to bring back the country's self-confidence.   Overnight, the MSCI Asia-Pacific Index gained 0.3 percent, while Japan's Topix Index closed broadly unchanged. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.2 percent lower at 5:45 a.m as gains for miners and energy producers were offset by losses for drugmakers. S&P 500 futures were flat.  Britain's Brexit Secretary David Davis rejected key EU demands on both the sequencing of exit negotiations and the rights of European citizens living in the U.K. The hardline stance could be a political move to paint the EU as the 'bad guy' during the current election campaign. JPMorgan Chase & Co., meanwhile, agreed to purchase an office building in Dublin which will be able to accommodate more than 1,000 workers, which a spokesperson said would give the bank ""some flexibility within the European Union.” This is what's caught our eye over the weekend."

Xi Jinping touts Silk Belt and Road, global cyber-attack set to spread, and another boost to Merkel's re-election hopes. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about. Chinese President Xi Jinping detailed the nation’s plan to lead globalization efforts as part of the Silk Belt and Road Initiative in a speech to world leaders at a forum in Beijing on Sunday. Xi also upped China’s pledged contribution to funds associated with a massive build-out of infrastructure and other investments throughout Asia, Europe, and Africa to better connect the world’s second-biggest economy with the rest of the world. China also plans to import more energy from the U.S. to meet its domestic needs. However, in a sign that cooperation between China and its neighbors still remains an aspirational goal, North Korea conducted a ballistic missile test shortly before Xi’s speech.  The global cyber-attack that crippled more than hundreds of thousands of computers across over 150 countries is poised to swell on Monday. The “ransomware employed by hackers, who have demanded bitcoin payments from the victims, renders files stored on afflicted computers inaccessible. A number of large corporations, including FedEx Corp. and Nissan Motor Co., have been infected with this malware, as have many hospitals. U.S. President Donald Trump directed his homeland security adviser to hold meetings on the matter over the weekend. Centrists are well-positioned to be in charge of Europe’s two largest economies for the foreseeable future. Angela Merkel’s Christian Democratic Union party won a clear victory in state elections held in North Rhine-Westphalia, home to more than 20 percent of German voters, with the Social Democrats —  the most visible opposition on the national stage — winning their lowest share of the vote in this region since World War Two. This result comes on the heels of another victory for Merkel’s party over the Social Democratic incumbent last weekend in a state vote, seemingly bolstering the chancellor’s odds at winning a fourth term in September. Meanwhile, the 39 year-old Emmanuel Macron officially became France’s youngest president on Sunday after winning the run-off against Marine Le Pen on May 7.   At midday Beijing time, we’ll get a trifecta of Chinese data of April: retail sales, fixed asset investment, and industrial production. Sales are expected to rise 10.8 percent year-on-year, a slight deceleration from March’s rate of annual increase. Fixed asset investment is expected to be up 9.1 percent year-to-date versus the same period in 2016, while industrial production is forecast to rise by 7 percent year-on-year from 7.6 percent in March. Last week, Chinese credit growth exceeded estimates despite recent regulatory curbs aimed at reining in leverage.  As this month's OPEC meeting looms, crude output in Libya is ramping higher as two oil fields re-open. After three consecutive weeks of declines, crude prices rebounded with West Texas Intermediate futures closing at $47.84 on Friday. But the soft end to the week came amid rising rig counts in the U.S., while Libya’s production jump shows shale isn’t the only challenge in rebalancing the physical market. As such, major producers may have to do more than merely extend current curbs if they aim to bring down global inventories expediently. This is what caught our eye over the last 24 hours."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-05-14/hospitals-gain-control-in-ransom-hack-more-attacks-may-come,"An unrivaled global cyber-attack is poised to continue claiming victims Monday as people return to work and turn on their desktop computers, even as hospitals and other facilities gained the upper hand against the first wave. More than 200,000 computers in at least 150 countries have so far been infected, according to Europol, the European Union’s law enforcement agency. The U.K.’s National Cyber Security Centre said new cases of so-called ransomware are possible “at a significant scale.” “We’ve seen the rise of ransomware becoming the principal threat, I think, but this is something we haven’t seen before -- the global reach is unprecedented,” Europol Executive Director Rob Wainwright said on ITV’s “Peston on Sunday” broadcast.  QuickTake Cybersecurity The malware used a technique purportedly stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency. It affected the U.K.’s National Health Service, Russia’s Ministry of Interior, China government agencies, Germany’s Deutsche Bahn rail system, automakers Nissan Motor Co. and Renault SA, PetroChina, logistics giant FedEx Corp., and other company and hospital computer systems in countries from Eastern Europe to the U.S. and Asia. The hackers used the tool to encrypt files within affected computers, making them inaccessible, and demanded ransom -- typically $300 in bitcoin. Russia and Ukraine had a heavy concentration of infections, according to Dutch security company Avast Software BV.   Microsoft Corp. President Brad Smith, in a blog post Sunday, said the attack is a “wake-up call” for governments in the U.S. and elsewhere to stop stockpiling tools to exploit digital vulnerabilities. “They need to take a different approach and adhere in cyberspace to the same rules applied to weapons in the physical world,” he said. About 97 percent of U.K. facilities and doctors disabled by the attack were back to normal operation, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said Saturday after a government meeting. At the height of the attack Friday and early Saturday, 48 organizations in the NHS were affected, and hospitals in London, North West England and Central England urged people with non-emergency conditions to stay away as technicians tried to stop the spread of the malicious software. The initial attack was stifled when a security researcher disabled a key mechanism used by the worm to spread, but experts said the hackers were likely to mount a second attack because so many users of personal computers with Microsoft operating systems couldn’t or didn’t download a security patch released in March that Microsoft had labeled “critical.” Microsoft said in a blog post Saturday that it was taking the “highly unusual“ step of providing the patch for older versions of Windows it was otherwise no longer supporting, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. While the scale of the attack shows Microsoft needs to strengthen its own capabilities, “there is simply no way for customers to protect themselves against threats unless they update their system,” Smith said in his blog post. “Otherwise they’re literally fighting the problems of the present with tools from the past. “This attack is a powerful reminder that information technology basics like keeping computers current and patched are a high responsibility for everyone, and it’s something every top executive should support."" Matt Suiche, founder of United Arab Emirates-based cyber security firm Comae Technologies, said he’s seen a variant on the original malware that still contains a kill-switch mechanism -- though future versions could find a way to overcome it. “We are lucky that this logic bug is still present,” Suiche said. The Good Guys Can Have the Upper Hand on Cybersecurity Victims have paid about $50,000 in ransom so far, with the total expected to rise, said Tom Robinson, chief operating officer and co-founder of Elliptic Enterprises Ltd., a ransomware consultant that works with banks and companies in the U.K., U.S. and Europe. Robinson, in an interview by email, said he calculated the total based on payments tracked to bitcoin addresses specified in the ransom demands. Last year an acute-care hospital in Hollywood paid $17,000 in bitcoin to an extortionist who hijacked its computer systems and forced doctors and staff to revert to pen and paper for record-keeping. A spokesman for Spain’s Telefonica SA said the hack affected some employees at its headquarters, but the phone company is attacked frequently and the impact of Friday’s incident wasn’t major. FedEx said it was “experiencing interference,” the Associated Press reported. Renault halted production at some factories to stop the virus from spreading, a spokesman said Saturday, while Nissan’s car plant in Sunderland, in northeast England, was affected without causing any major impact on business, an official said. In Germany, Deutsche Bahn faced “technical disruptions” on electronic displays at train stations, but travel was unaffected, the company said in a statement on its website. Newspaper reports showed images of a ransomware message on display screens blocking train information. Russia’s Interior Ministry, with oversight of the police forces, said about “1,000 computers were infected,” which it described as less than 1 percent of the total, according to its website. In China, the malware affected computers at “several” unspecified government departments, the country’s Cyberspace Administration said on its WeChat blog Monday. Since that initial attack, agencies and companies from the police to banks and communications firms have put preventive measures in place, while Qihoo 360 Technology Co., Tencent Holdings Ltd. and other cybersecurity firms have begun making protection tools available, the internet overseer said. China National Petroleum Corp., which owns PetroChina, reported that some of its 21,000 gas stations had seen their digital payment systems disabled by the attack and resorted to accepting cash. More than 80 percent of the stations had been reconnected to the network as of noon on May 14, the company said. Several Chinese universities had also been hit by the attacks, according to local media reports. In Japan, Hitachi Ltd. said that some of its computers had been affected. In South Korea, CJ CGV Co., the country’s largest cinema chain, said advertising servers and displays at film theaters were hit by ransomware. Movie servers weren’t affected and are running as normal, it said in a text message Monday. Indonesia’s government reported two hospitals in Jakarta were affected. While any size company could be vulnerable, many large organizations with robust security departments would have prioritized the update that Microsoft released in March and wouldn’t be vulnerable to Friday’s attack. Ransomware is a particularly stubborn problem because victims are often tricked into allowing the malicious software to run on their computers, and the encryption happens too fast for security software to catch it. Some security experts calculate that ransomware may bring in as much as $1 billion a year in revenue for the attackers. The attack was apparently halted in the afternoon in the U.K. when a researcher took control of an Internet domain that acted as a kill switch for the worm’s propagation, according to Ars Technica. “I will confess that I was unaware registering the domain would stop the malware until after I registered it, so initially it was accidental,” wrote the researcher, who uses the Twitter name @MalwareTechBlog. “So long as the domain isn’t revoked, this particular strain will no longer cause harm, but patch your systems ASAP as they will try again.” There is a high probability that Russian-language cybercriminals were behind the attack, said Aleks Gostev, chief cybersecurity expert for Kaspersky Labs. “Ransomware is traditionally their topic,” he said. “The geography of attacks that hit post-Soviet Union most also suggests that.” — With assistance by Stepan Kravchenko, Ksenia Galouchko, Robert Hutton, Jack Sidders, Adam Satariano, Nour Al Ali, Aibing Guo, and Penny Peng"

The ransomware used in Friday’s cyber-attacks encrypts files and demands that victims pay $300 in bitcoin for them to be decrypted, the latest in a vexing style of security breaches that, at the very least, forces organizations to revert to backup systems to keep critical systems running. The malicious software has infected more than 75,000 computers in 99 countries worldwide on Friday, most of them concentrated in Russia, Ukraine and Taiwan, according to Dutch cybersecurity company Avast Software BV. The attackers were exploiting a vulnerability in Microsoft Corp. software that was patched in March, according to cybersecurity researchers. Attack code targeting that vulnerability was released publicly by Shadow Brokers, a group that has been leaking stolen hacking tools purportedly from the NSA. That connection has given critics of U.S. hacking ammunition for their argument that governments finding flaws in commercial technologies and keeping them secret for the purpose of exploiting them can carry a public risk. “These attacks underscore the fact that vulnerabilities will be exploited not just by our security agencies, but by hackers and criminals around the world,” said Patrick Toomey, a staff attorney at the American Civil Liberties Union’s National Security Project. “It is past time for Congress to enhance cybersecurity by passing a law that requires the government to disclose vulnerabilities to companies in a timely manner. Patching security holes immediately, not stockpiling them, is the best way to make everyone’s digital life safer.” While the victim tally is likely to grow, the ransomware, called WanaCrypt0r, only affects computers that haven’t applied Microsoft’s two-month-old fix, a reminder that individuals and organizations that don’t routinely update their machines are vulnerable. Hospitals are notoriously slow in applying security fixes, in part because of how disruptive it is to take patient-facing equipment and databases offline. That has made them a reliable target of ransomware and identity-theft attacks, and why they routinely fall victim even to random mass attacks.   In the U.K. on Friday, hospitals urged people with non-emergency conditions to stay away after the cyber-attack affected large parts of the country’s National Health Service. Forty-five NHS organizations were hit, while a large number of Spanish companies were also attacked using ransomware. “We’re not able to tell who’s behind the attack,” Home Secretary Amber Rudd told the BBC on Saturday. “It’s not targeted at the NHS -- it feels random in terms of where it’s happened.” She said she’d been told there was no evidence of patient data being stolen, and said the hack was partly the result of people using outdated operating systems. “Windows XP is not a good platform for keeping your data secure,” she said. Hospitals in London, North West England and Central England have all been affected, according to the BBC. Mid-Essex Clinical Commissioning Group, which runs hospitals and ambulances in an area east of London, said on Twitter that it had “an IT issue affecting some NHS computer systems,” adding “Please do not attend Accident And Emergency unless it’s an emergency!” The impact on services is not due to the ransomware itself, but due to NHS Trusts shutting systems to prevent it from spreading, said Brian Lord, a former deputy director of Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ), the U.K.’s signals intelligence agency, who is now managing director of cybersecurity firm PGI Cyber. Lord, who described an attack of this type as ""inevitable,"" said the impact was exacerbated because most NHS Trusts had ""a poor understanding of network configuration meaning everything has to shut down."" A screen-shot of an apparent ransom message, sent to a hospital, showed a demand for $300 in bitcoin for files that had been encrypted to be decrypted. Workers across the NHS have since been sent emails from the health service’s IT teams warning not to open or click on suspicious attachments or links. Spain’s National Cryptologic Center, which is part of the country’s intelligence agency, said on its website that there had been a “massive ransomware attack” against a big number of Spanish organizations affecting Microsoft’s Windows operating system. El Mundo reported that the attackers sought a ransom in bitcoin. “Today many of our customers around the world and the critical systems they depend on were victims of malicious ‘WannaCrypt’ software,” Phillip Misner, principal security group manager at Microsoft’s Security Response Center, said in a statement on the company’s website. “Seeing businesses and individuals affected by cyberattacks, such as the ones reported today, was painful.” Misner said the company took the “highly unusual step” of releasing free security patches for unsupported out-of-date operating systems, including Windows XP and Windows Server 2003. While Friday’s attack could damage the reputation of Microsoft’s security, it’s likely to be limited, said Sid Parakh, a fund manager at Becker Capital Management, which owns Microsoft stock. There have been so many high-profile hacks that if a fix is available, it’s the user’s responsibility to download it, he said. “Every time this happens it hurts the underlying product’s reputation,” Parakh said. But Microsoft has “been in a worse state in the past.” Ransomware typically gets onto a computer when a person unsuspectingly downloads a file that looks like a normal attachment or web link. A hacker can then trigger the malware to freeze the computer, prompting a person to pay a ransom or lose all their files. Hospitals have been a common target because the culprits know how critical digital records are for treating patients. There have been several incidents in the U.S., including one in Indiana where a hospital’s IT system was taken down and patients had to be diverted to other facilities, according to a local news report.  Ransomware attacks have also been soaring. The number of such attacks increased 50 percent in 2016, according to an April report from Verizon Communications Inc. These types of attacks account for 72 percent of all the malware incidents involving the health-care industry in 2016, according to Verizon.

Spain’s National Cryptologic Center, which is part of the country’s intelligence agency, said on its website that there had been a “massive ransomware attack” against a big number of Spanish organizations affecting Microsoft Corp’s Windows operating system. El Mundo reported that the attackers sought a ransom in bitcoins. A group of computers at Telefonica SA’s headquarters in Madrid was attacked by a virus, a spokesman for the company said. Attacks occur regularly against Telefonica and today’s wasn’t major, the official said. The incident was a generic one that affected several companies, Telefonica’s Chief Data Officer Jose Maria Alonso said on Twitter. Scanned images of internal Telefonica emails posted on line by Eldiario.es showed that the company’s security department ordered employees to switch off their computers and log-off from internet wi-fi connections. The order was also broadcast through load-speakers. As a client of Telefonica, Iberdrola SA has taken some preventive measures such as switching off computers, a press officer for the company said by phone. Iberdrola’s operations are working normally, he said. El Mundo also reported that Gas Natural SA had been affected by the attack. An official for the company wasn’t immediately available for comment."

2017-05-04T20:30:08.216Z,"The Daily Prophet: If You're Long Commodities, Our Condolences","Robert Burgess
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-05-04/the-daily-prophet-if-you-re-long-commodities-our-condolences,"It would be an understatement to say it was an ugly day for anything related to commodities. The Bloomberg Commodities Index tumbled 1.82 percent, its biggest drop since November. Energy markets, agriculture-related raw goods such as wheat and cattle, and metals such as copper, nickel and the iron ore used to make steel were all hit hard. Even gold dived. Economists like to say commodities are not the referendum on the global economy they once were, but it’s hard not to notice how closely the recent weakness tracks the drop in the Citi Economic Surprise Index, which measures the data that exceed forecasts relative to those that miss, to its lowest level since the start of the year.   OPEC HAS FAILED -- AGAINThe oil rally following OPEC’s deal to curb supply has disappeared. Futures on both sides of the Atlantic dropped to their lowest since late November on growing signs that the group’s production cuts are failing to clear a surplus of crude, according to Bloomberg News' Mark Shenk. Oil stocks felt the pinch, with the S&P Oil & Gas Exploration and Production Index slumping as much as 4.9 percent Thursday to the lowest since August. ""Evidence is mounting that the OPEC agreement, and the market’s reaction, were much ado about nothing,"" said John Kilduff, a partner at Again Capital LLC, a New York-based hedge fund that focuses on energy. U.S. crude output has risen to the highest since August 2015 as shale drillers add rigs every week. In response, OPEC is likely to extend the 1.2 million barrel-a-day cut agreed to in November for six months, according to Nigerian Oil Minister Emmanuel Ibe Kachikwu. OPEC will meet May 25 in Vienna to make a decision. Russia is said to support prolonging the curbs, according to a government official. COPPER, NICKEL AND IRON ORE  TAKE A BATHCopper posted the biggest two-day loss since 2015, as industrial metals plunged amid concern over demand in China and speculation that the Federal Reserve is intent on raising interest rates two more times this year. Demand concerns are mounting just as copper stockpiles tracked by the London Metal Exchange jumped 25 percent in two days, the most since March, signaling ample supplies, according to Bloomberg News' Susanne Barton and Mark Burton. The Bloomberg World Mining Index of equities fell for a fourth day as iron ore tumbled in Dalian and steel plummeted in Shanghai. Metals have come under pressure after data this week signaled a slowdown in China’s manufacturing, with the LMEX Index of six major metals tumbling 2.5 percent on Wednesday and a further 0.8 percent Thursday. Iron ore is in full-scale retreat, with futures in China plunging to end limit-down on investor concern about the outlook for demand in the world’s top user, fresh signs of burgeoning supply from Australia and the hostile backdrop of a broad-based sell-off in base metals, according to Bloomberg News' Martin Richie and Jasmine Ng. “Iron ore’s center of gravity is constantly moving lower,” said Zhao Chaoyue, an analyst at China Merchants Futures Co. WILL THE DEFLATION TALK HEAT UP AGAIN?The drop in commodities prices is leading bond traders to reduce their outlook for inflation. Breakeven rates on five-year inflation-protected bonds, or the inflation rate that traders see over the life of the securities, have fallen to their lowest levels since November. That's significant because it’s believed that rising inflation expectations were one key variable that allowed Fed policy makers to suggest in early March that they were ready to accelerate the pace of interest-rate increases, which they did on March 15. Although the Fed left rates unchanged Wednesday following its policy meeting, the central bank issued a statement that said “inflation measured on a 12-month basis recently has been running close to the committee’s 2 percent longer-run objective.” The Fed may be looking backward, but the bond market looks forward. EUROPE IS HOT!One group that is all smiles is euro traders. The shared currency soared as National Front leaders are beginning to acknowledge that the euro skeptic Marine Le Pen may be headed for defeat in Sunday’s French presidential election after she failed to land the decisive blow in Wednesday’s television debate that she needed to overtake Emmanuel Macron, according to Bloomberg News' Helene Fouquet, Mark Deen and John Follain. The Bloomberg Euro Index jumped to its highest level since early November, and is up 3.26 percent from its closing low this year on April 14. It gained against all 30 major currencies tracked by Bloomberg. Scoring 40 percent in the runoff “would be an enormous victory,” the candidate’s niece and a fellow National Front lawmaker Marion Marechal-Le Pen, told website Boursorama Thursday. The optimism extended to European stocks and bonds, where French 10-year yields fell to within 42 basis points of German bund yields, down from about 75 basis points last month and the narrowest spread since December. CAN ANYTHING STOP BITCOIN?Those who say that you're never able to identify a bubble until after it bursts have never seen bitcoin. The digital currency keeps flying higher and no one seems to know exactly why. The price of one bitcoin surpassed $1,600 today for the first time, before easing back to $1,540 and bringing its gain since late March to more than 50 percent. A year ago it was traded for a little more than $400. In its short history Bitcoin has been known for rapid spikes followed by rapid descents. Its backers say the digital currency has become a haven along the lines of gold. That would make sense given the concerns about China and commodities, but gold has been tanking. Another explanation for the recent leg up has been the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's decision to review a ruling made on March 10 that blocked a proposal by the Winklevoss twins for a publicly traded fund based on the digital currency. Bloomberg Intelligence says that the SEC's approval of the first quadruple-leveraged ETFs on May 2 may provide hope to backers of bitcoin ETFs.  TEA LEAVESIt seems as if whenever the Fed feels the economic data isn’t coming in as strong as it would like, whether it be sluggish growth or rates of inflation that are too low, it trots out the word “transitory” to describe the conditions. It has used that word a lot in recent years, including yesterday when the Federal Open Market Committee said after deciding leave interest rates unchanged that “the committee views the slowing in growth during the first quarter as likely to be transitory.” The April employment report to be released Friday will either ratify that statement or raise questions of whether the weakness is extending into the second quarter. The median estimate of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News is for an increase of 190,000 jobs last month, up from the disappointing 98,000 in March.

2017-04-27T13:15:46.725Z,Fund Conflicts and Tax Napkins,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-27/fund-conflicts-and-tax-napkins,"Family offices. If you run an investment firm that invests other people's money, should you also run a different investment firm that invests your own money? The problems are fairly obvious. There are conflicts of interest: If you find a good investment, how do you decide whether to put your money or your clients' money into it? And how do you deal with selling investments from one fund to another? There are attention issues: If you're spending your time on your personal fund, you're not spending it on your clients' fund. And there is a conceptual problem: Why should clients put their money in your fund when you are putting a lot of your own money in a different fund? Here's a Wall Street Journal article about the family offices of big hedge-fund and private equity fund managers, full of conflict-y stories, like the time Blackstone Group LP President Tony James's family office bought some of a company from Blackstone and then later sold it back to a different Blackstone company. You'd think that this stuff could be mostly avoided, but only mostly:  But even there you can run into problems: What if one of your hedge fund's public portfolio companies wants to buy one of your personal private portfolio companies, as happened to Ackman? Generally speaking the conflicts of interest seem to be, like, 80 percent solvable. You have conflicts committees, and recusals, and disclosure, and general rules about dividing up the investment universe. And you expect the fund's managers to mostly work for the fund, and work for themselves a little bit. ""We want to make sure the fund is always the primary beneficiary of investment ideas and the primary beneficiary of the portfolio manager’s time,"" says an investment adviser. ""Primary,"" not ""exclusive,"" but you live with the imperfection mostly because, in finance, conflicts of interest tend to be a good sign. You want to invest your money with someone who sees a lot of deal flow, who thinks about investing all the time, who has built up a network of information and favors with bankers and investors. And if some of the deals she sees, or some of the thoughts she has, or some of the favors she gets, aren't appropriate for her client's fund, why shouldn't she take advantage of them for herself? ""Important people,"" runs John Whitehead's famous commandment, ""like to deal with other important people. Are you one?"" Fund investors like to deal with important fund managers, and conflicts are a pretty good measure of importance. Beyond the conflicts issue, there is the conceptual issue:  This one, though, has a fairly straightforward answer. The clients aren't 100 percent in the managers' fund, so why should the managers be? The clients want the fund to do the thing it is supposed to do, to give them exposure to a particular asset class or strategy or risk factor. They want the fund manager to take certain risks -- the risks she told them she'd take -- because they have built a whole portfolio that balances out the risks that different managers will take. If you have money in a long fund, and money in a short fund, and you think that you're market neutral, then you want the short fund to actually be short. But if your short fund manager has 100 percent of her wealth in her own fund, and the market keeps going up, she is going to be tempted to get a bit less short. Letting the fund manager diversify out of her fund lets her remain concentrated within the fund; letting her lower her personal risk lets her increase the risk in her funds. ""Be regular and orderly in your personal account, so that you may be violent and original in your hedge fund,"" that sort of thing. You want her to manage her fund in the best interests of diversified investors, because all of the outside investors are diversified themselves. (Though, I mean, she could just index with her personal money.)  Elsewhere in family offices, family offices are buying art, which seems much worse than families buying art: But ... what ... why? If you are rich enough to have a family office, you can afford to buy art because you like to look at it. You don't have to look at the numbers at all! That is the whole point of art, and of being rich! I don't understand people. Taxes. Yesterday the Trump administration pretended to release a tax plan, and while this obliges reporters, and poor Steven Mnuchin and Gary Cohn, to pretend that it was a tax plan, we are under no such obligation here. It doesn't even look like a tax plan! You can tell because there are almost no numbers in it, and the fonts are all wrong. Also, it would fit on a napkin, but it takes planning to print things on a napkin, and they clearly wrote this on the bus over to the press conference. Bloomberg reports: It was designed to fool Donald Trump into thinking that it's a tax plan, but the rest of us don't need to be fooled. Still there will be a lot of talk about winners and losers in the hypothetical universe where this plan becomes law. An obvious set of winners is corporations, whose top tax rate would drop from 35 to 15 percent. But through the magic of accounting, some of these winners would look like losers: Next time someone complains that companies that report non-GAAP earnings are using ""fantasy numbers,"" let's all remember that GAAP would require Citigroup and Bank of America to report billions of dollars of losses solely because they will pay lower taxes in the future. Under this tax plan, Citi and BofA would have the same amount of money now, and more money in the future, but under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles they would have to report a huge loss anyway. Presumably shareholders would also be interested in the pro forma non-GAAP numbers excluding that loss. Another set of hypothetical winners is owners of pass-through entities, like hedge-fund managers and law firm partners and Trump himself, whose taxes on their business income would top out at 15 percent. Here is one who is hypothetically excited: Cute! Wait, why not? Because he wants to keep her in the dark about the family's finances, or because, like me, he is not counting on this tax break being real? I assume that the way it would work is that any pass-through business income that is kept in the business would be subject to a 15 percent tax, while any income that is paid out in compensation -- and in particular, any income that is used to pay personal expenses -- would be subject to higher personal tax rates. In practice this would turn into sort of a consumption tax, at least on the rich: You'd pay personal income taxes on the money you need to live on, but 15 percent on money you can save. Those who need their money would be taxed more than those who don't. But here I am interpreting a lot, from the one-pager. Hypothetical losers include people who live in New York, who would pay federal taxes on the money they pay in state taxes. I mean, also people in other high-tax states, but I live in New York, so that is of more hypothetical interest to me. Though I can avoid some of the problem by selling Money Stuff to Bloomberg via Money Stuff Business Thing LLC, my pass-through entity. (I have consulted the academic literature on naming and gravitas in coming up with its name.) Elsewhere in executive theater, the Trump administration pretended to plan to pull out of Nafta for a few hours yesterday, but then backed away from that. Markets reacted sharply to the pretend withdrawal, and don't they feel silly now? Poor Jesse Litvak. Jesse Litvak is a former Jefferies LLC managing director who was convicted of lying about bond prices in 2014 and sentenced to two years in prison. His conviction was reversed on appeal in 2015, because the appeals court decided that he should have had the opportunity to explain to a jury that actually everyone lies about bond prices so it's no big deal: It can't be fraud if it doesn't deceive anyone, and if everyone lies then no one will be deceived. So he got a new trial, and he presented this defense, and it worked: This year a jury acquitted him on nine out of the 10 counts he faced. But it did convict him on one count, because he altered the transcript of a chat and sent it to a customer, and apparently the jury concluded that that's beyond the pale even in bond trading.  At the time, I said that this was a ""totally sensible distinction"": Lying about your cost for a bond seems like the sort of used-car-salesman-y tactic that (a jury could reasonably conclude) a customer would treat skeptically, while altering documents seems like ... you know ... fraud. But I also said that it was sad for Litvak: ""In the federal white-collar sentencing system, one conviction is not all that much better than 10."" That was correct: Yesterday he was sentenced to the same two years in prison, and a larger fine than the first time. Litvak's lawyers did their best: That is true. Litvak's case is part of a broader crackdown on lying by bond traders, which both Litvak and the government seem to agree is (or was) pervasive. But the crackdown has been pretty uneven: One of Litvak's ex-colleagues, who was accused of very similar conduct, got a $30,000 fine and a three-month suspension from the industry, while Litvak will spend two years in prison. I suppose the point is to make a few examples out of people to scare the rest straight, but it's a bit rough if you are the example. Bitcoins and banks. U.S. bank regulation is so weird: The concern here is that JPMorgan might transfer money for another bank, and that other bank might transfer money for a bitcoin exchange, and that bitcoin exchange might transfer money for a drug dealer. Which, in the eyes of the law, means that JPMorgan might as well be dealing drugs itself. I sometimes think about the analogy between banks and airlines: If a drug dealer uses a bank to move money, that bank is held responsible, but if he just gets on a plane with a bag of money, no one thinks to hold the airline responsible. But this is much further removed. This is like, a taxi driver flies on United Airlines from New York to Miami, and in Miami he picks up a guy who owns a boat and drives him to the marina, and then the guy with with boat transports bags of cash for a drug dealer, and you hold United responsible. Vast swathes of legitimate financial transactions will be cut off if you punish banks for dealing with people who deal with people who deal with people who commit crimes.  Alternatively banks are just protecting their financial hegemony by trying to shut down bitcoin exchanges. That's also possible. But bitcoin's claim to be able to supplant the banking system is a little undermined by its reliance on big U.S. banks to actually be useful. People are worried about unicorns. ""All of Uber's problems can be boiled down to a single policy,"" says a guy, and it's not one of the 20 policies you're thinking of! (It's the no-tipping policy.) Meanwhile Didi Chuxing, Uber Technologies Inc.'s Chinese rival, ""is raising between $5 and $6 billion in a funding round that would value the company at around $50 billion."" I remember once declaring that a $50 billion valuation makes a private company an ""ubercorn,"" and now there will apparently be two of them, both in the same industry.  Elsewhere, Robinhood, the free stock-trading app, is now a unicorn, raising $110 million at a $1.3 billion valuation. So the Enchanted Forest is now also Sherwood Forest.  People are worried about stock buybacks. When people in the U.S. worry about stock buybacks, it's usually because they think that buybacks encourage short-termism and reduce investment and innovation. There's occasionally an element of worry that the buybacks could be market manipulation, but you rarely see anything quite like this, about China Evergrande Group in Hong Kong: ""Analysts believe that the buybacks are related to the need for a higher valuation in order to inject Evergrande’s property assets into a Shenzhen-listed vehicle,"" and I am always happy to see companies buying back stock in order to make it easier to sell stock.

2017-04-28T13:23:27.374Z,"Disclosure, Transparency and Criticism","Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-28/disclosure-transparency-and-criticism,"Private companies are the new public companies. A well-known fact is that there are fewer public companies than there used to be, and companies prefer to remain private for longer. One standard story is that public markets have become less attractive, what with increased disclosure requirements and evil short-termist high-frequency traders, but that story does not entirely fit the facts. Last month I argued that ""a more interesting answer is that public markets haven't really gotten worse; instead, private markets have gotten better."" The disclosure and nuisance of being public was always burdensome, but public markets used to be where the money was. Now that you can raise a lot of money in private markets, why bother going public? Here are a blog post and related article from Elisabeth de Fontenay arguing that ""the culprit need not be rising costs of corporate disclosure, but declining benefits"": One mystery is: If disclosure is good, why don't private investors demand it too? Regulators don't require Uber to disclose audited financials to raise billions of dollars, but why don't Uber's investors require it? De Fontenay's answer ""is that disclosure has material third-party effects or externalities,"" helping not just the particular company's shareholders but the market and society more broadly. Uber's investors get the optimal amount of information (not much!) for them, while, say, Apple's investors get the optimal amount of information for society. But it is an unstable equilibrium for Uber: But if that's the case, then more companies should stay private, which will reduce the volume of public information, which will make fund-raising for private companies increasingly difficult. ""Public companies have little reason to continue to provide this subsidy."" Radical transparency. Here is a story -- on LinkedIn, of course -- about the time that a Bridgewater Associates employee named Jim Haskel sent an email to founder Ray Dalio saying ""you deserve a 'D-' for your performance today in the meeting ... you did not prepare at all because there is no way you could have and been that disorganized."" Of course Dalio loved it: From the outside, it always seems to me like Bridgewater's radical transparency exists, as it were, in quotation marks. There is a lot of strenuous performance of openness and egalitarianism. The idea of this story is that Dalio has such natural, unpretentious, tell-me-anything interactions with his employees that they feel comfortable sending him harsh honest emails like this. Which is true. But also, when they send him those emails, he turns them into a TED talk. I never do that when my friends send me blunt emails. (Should I?) If you send your boss an email criticizing his performance, and he says ""you're fired,"" that is one kind of power move. But if he says ""ho ho ho, you old rascal, well done,"" and then tells a room full of chuckling TED listeners about his benign tolerance, that is a different kind of power move. I think I find it more intimidating? But I don't work at Bridgewater. Anyway Dalio is on Twitter now, which is going to be great for him. If you like getting negative feedback, you'll love Twitter! Maybe next year he can give a TED talk about mean things that people have tweeted at him. Lawsuits. There is a well-known asymmetry in financial markets, which is that if you are short a company and say mean things about it, you might get sued or investigated or otherwise accused of manipulation and fraud, while if you are long a company and say nice things about it, no one will ever complain. Of course this is an asymmetry in life, too: If you say mean things about a person, he might sue you for slander, but if you say nice things about him, no one else is likely to sue you for inaccurate praise. That's not even a thing. Of course if you say nice things about a person, and someone dates or hires him on your recommendation, and he is terrible, then you have caused harm. But it is not the kind of harm that the law concerns itself with. Similarly, if you buy a stock and publicly announce ""this is a great stock,"" and then it goes to zero, people will think you were dumb or unlucky. If you short a stock and publicly announce ""this is a terrible stock,"" and it doubles -- or goes to zero! -- people will think that you were dishonestly trying to manipulate the stock for your own benefit.  Anyway shortly after the formation of the universe in the Big Bang, some hedge funds including SAC Capital Advisors LP shorted the stock of Fairfax Financial Holdings Ltd., and they said mean things about it, and Fairfax sued, and time passed, and generations of people were born and died, and empires rose and fell, and still that case is somehow going on. And yesterday a New Jersey appeals court said it could continue: Yes, short selling will do that. Meanwhile, ""a New York State Supreme Court judge dismissed a lawsuit by Highland Capital Management accusing one of the asset-management firm’s investors of libel."" International regulation. If you have a world in which every big developed economy is run by globalist technocrats, they are going to agree on a lot. Bank regulations, for instance, will be harmonized, so that each country's banks can operate safely and efficiently in every other country. If, on the other hand, you have a world in which a lot of the biggest developed economies are run by nationalists who want to back away from international commitments and focus on their countries' interests above all else, then bank regulation could get weird: Of course it doesn't have to go that way. You could imagine an anti-globalist government tightening bank regulation, rejecting international technocratic norms to be less generous to banks, rather than more. Having more banks might be good for a country, but having more bank failures is bad, and nationalists could, in the abstract, want to reduce the influence and danger of international banks in their countries. Contemporary nationalist populism is often described -- including by those nationalists! -- as a delayed reaction to the global financial crisis of 2008, and to the excessive power of global banks. And yet in practice the nationalists all seem to want more banks, and to reduce regulation to attract them. Distressed debt. I try not to write about, or link to, Donald Trump psychologizing or Kremlinology much around here, because that is what, you know, the entire rest of the internet is for. But I am going to make an exception for this excellent Gillian Tett column, because it has a financial angle. She points out that Trump's advisers (other than Rex Tillerson) ""do not have the usual instincts of seasoned S&P 500 chief executives,"" but instead ""have been shaped by the world of dealmaking and arbitrage"": There is also an obvious zero-sum element to a lot of distressed dealmaking. The basic job of a corporate executive is to grow the pie, to find new markets and products and ideas to make people, and the company, better off. The job of a distressed dealmaker is, sometimes, to save the pie -- to find a way to keep a troubled business going -- but also often just to divide the pie, to identify the security or process or argument or trick that will give him the most leverage and the biggest chunk of a limited recovery. Elsewhere  in Trump psychologizing: ""Trump says he thought being president would be easier than his old life."" And here is Larry Summers on Trump's pretend tax plan: ""I can only imagine how demoralized the Treasury tax staff — a group that rightly prides itself on its professionalism and analytic seriousness — must be."" And elsewhere in distressed debt, here is a profile of Adam Savarese, the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. distressed trader who outperformed last year and underperformed this year. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. There are roughly three ways to think about blockchains in banking: Number 1 is the sort of bitcoin-utopian dream. Maybe it will come true! But not if the banks have anything to say about it. Most of the action in financial-industry blockchain initiatives is being led by groups of banks, and by traditional middlemen like stock exchanges and clearinghouses. Their dream is of a centralized, trusted, permissioned system that happens to use some of the technology of the blockchain.  Number 2 is the sort of Davos-y dream, in which ""rather than to stay at the margins of the finance industry blockchain will become the beating heart of it."" Maybe it will come true! But if it does, it will require an extraordinary level of cooperation. Banks, governments, corporations, individuals, whatever will all have to get on a single blockchain, or a system of blockchains that talk to each other seamlessly, in order to realize the benefits of a global architecture. Number 3 is, like, some bank database programs are old, and need an upgrade. It's no one's dream. No one dreams about upgrading databases. But they actually do it, which is something. Anyway here's a story about how JPMorgan Chase & Co. is quitting ""the mammoth bank blockchain consortium led by New York-based startup R3 CEV""; other banks including Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Morgan Stanley had previously quit, but a bunch of other banks remain. Also JPMorgan remains in a bunch of other blockchain groups: I suppose all this fragmentation of blockchain initiatives could be just a hedging of bets, and one day one of them really will be the architecture of the entire financial system. Or more likely one consortium will build a settlement system for syndicated loans, and another will build the clearinghouse for one emerging-market stock exchange, and a third will build a blockchain for shipping companies clearing customs, and the world will continue much as it is, a bunch of different transaction types with a bunch of different processes, none of them particularly talking to each other. Shareholder meetings. We talked the other day about Wells Fargo & Co.'s shareholder meeting, in which an old-timey activist shouted an approximate movie quote while being removed from the hotel ballroom for violating Robert's Rules of Order. That is pretty classically how U.S. bank shareholder meetings go. Meanwhile in Switzerland: Yeah you don't see a lot of rappelling at U.S. shareholder meetings. Our meetings tend to be contentious, yes, but not particularly athletic. ""When I moved here, I was told this is a quiet, mountainous country,"" said Thiam. ""This is more excitement than I expected.""  People are worried about unicorns. Uber Technologies Inc. is interviewing candidates for the job of chief operating officer, whose responsibilities would include helping Chief Executive Officer Travis Kalanick to grow up. It seems challenging: Presumably the COO's responsibility would be to move the seshes to 9 a.m., and to draw up agendas in advance. I hope that Uber goes public soon, because I really want to read about this in its prospectus. ""We make many of our decisions in late-night sessions, which we refer to as 'seshes,'"" some junior lawyer will have to write. Meanwhile, here is a deep-dive investigation into claims that Kalanick ""once held the world's second-highest score for the Nintendo Wii Tennis video game.""

2017-04-27T04:01:00.001Z,"Cyberattacks Involving Extortion Are on the Up, Verizon Says","Jeremy Kahn
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-27/cyberattacks-involving-extortion-are-on-the-rise-report-shows,"Cyberattacks involving ransomware -- in which criminals use malicious software to encrypt a users’ data and then extort money to unencrypt it -- increased 50 percent in 2016, according to a report from Verizon Communications Inc. And criminals increasingly shifted from going after individual consumers to attacking vulnerable organizations and businesses, the report said. Government organizations were the most frequent target of these ransomware attacks, followed by health-care businesses and financial services, according to data from security company McAfee Inc., which partnered with Verizon on the report published Thursday. Instances of ransomware attacks have grown along with the market for bitcoin, the digital currency that is most commonly how cybercriminals demand ransoms be paid because of its anonymity. While overall most malware was delivered through infected websites, increasingly criminals were turning to phishing -- using fraudulent emails designed to get a user to download attachments or click on links to websites that are infected with malware -- to carry out attacks. A fifth of all malware raids began with a phishing email in 2016, while fewer than 1 in 10 did the year before, according to the report. ""These emails are often targeted at specific job functions, such as HR and accounting -- whose employees are most likely to open attachments or click on links -- or even specific individuals,"" the report said. Verizon is currently in the process of acquiring Yahoo! Inc.’s internet properties at a $350 million discount after revelations of security breaches at the web company. Yahoo said in December that thieves in 2013 stole information from 500 million customer accounts, from email addresses to scrambled account passwords. Such a data cache may allow criminals to go after more sensitive personal information elsewhere online. Whereas in the past most ransomware simply encrypted the data on the device where it was first opened, Marc Spitler, a Verizon security researcher, said criminal gangs were increasingly using more sophisticated hacking techniques, seeking out business critical systems and encrypting entire data servers. ""There is increased sophisticated surveillance and targeting of organizations to maximize profit,"" he said in an interview. Criminal gangs were behind the majority of all cybersecurity breaches, Verizon said, with financial services firms the most common victims, accounting for about a quarter of all attacks. But espionage - whether that was by foreign governments or unknown entities - was on the rise, Verizon said, accounting for 21 percent of all breaches in 2016 up from less than 10 percent in 2010. Besides governments, manufacturing firms were the most likely to be targeted in espionage-motivated attacks, the report said. There has also been a surge in espionage-related breaches targeting universities and other educational institutions, spiking from almost none in 2012 to more than 20 percent last year, it said. The Verizon report, which is published annually, draws on the company’s own data from breaches its security consultants have responded to and data contributed by 65 partner organizations, including the U.S. Secret Service. NTT Security, a unit of Japan’s Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., released a report earlier this week that showed results similar to Verizon’s findings"
2017-04-26T11:00:22.745Z,The Seven Habits of Highly Effective Drug Dealers,"Max Chafkin
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-26/the-seven-habits-of-highly-effective-drug-dealers,"Just over two years ago, a federal jury convicted Ross Ulbricht, the then-30-year-old creator of the online marketplace Silk Road, of conspiring to distribute narcotics, among other charges. In announcing that Ulbricht had received a life sentence under the so-called kingpin statute, the Department of Justice compared his transgressions to those committed by crime bosses in the offline world. “Make no mistake,” said Preet Bharara, at the time the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, which oversaw the prosecution, “Ulbricht was a drug dealer and criminal profiteer who exploited people’s addictions.” In American Kingpin (Portfolio, $27), a potboiler recounting of Ulbricht’s exploits and eventual capture, journalist Nick Bilton suggests an alternate archetype for understanding his subject: the Silicon Valley chief executive officer. Bilton, who covers tech for Vanity Fair, writes that Silk Road was “no different from Facebook or Twitter,” in that it was a web-based marketplace that tolerated bad behavior on the part of its users. Except instead of inadvertently facilitating, say, fake news in the case of Facebook or hate speech in the case of Twitter, Silk Road was optimized for the trade of drugs and weapons. The site was founded in 2011 as a sort of activist project, an Amazon.com-like mall of illegal goods where the use of bitcoin ensured buyers remained anonymous. It was devious and brazen. Ulbricht, a militant libertarian with limited technical abilities who’d recently flunked out of a materials-science Ph.D. program at Penn State, hoped it would make American drug laws essentially unenforceable. By the time the FBI seized Silk Road’s assets and arrested Ulbricht in 2013, the marketplace had a half-dozen remote employees and almost a million customers—and had sold more than $1 billion in goods. Bilton portrays Ulbricht as a gentle but radical idealist whose only possessions seem to have been a pair of shorts, a djembe drum, and a copy of The Fountainhead. The “CEO of the Silk Road,” as Bilton calls him, came into his own only after moving to San Francisco, where he rubbed elbows with Bay Area startup founders. “They had all read the same Ayn Rand books,” Bilton writes. “These chief executives shared the same quotes on Facebook as he did: ‘The question isn’t who is going to let me; it’s who is going to stop me.’ ” In Bilton’s telling, Ulbricht eventually spun out of control, paying an $80,000 bitcoin bounty to wipe out a snitch, then justifying his moral decrepitude by comparing murder for hire to the working conditions at iPhone factories. Thankfully, no one actually died; his would-be assassins were undercover police gathering evidence as part of the investigation that eventually led to his capture. As the FBI closed in, Ulbricht attempted to cheer up his demoralized lieutenants with a cheesy motivational speech adapted from the management theorist Peter Drucker. The moment, which comes just after Bilton’s description of another murder-for-hire attempt, damns not only Ulbricht but also the entire genre of business books. During the 2015 trial, Ulbricht’s lawyers acknowledged that their client had started Silk Road, but they alleged that he’d subsequently turned the business over to an unknown (and more ruthless) third party who framed him. Bilton’s scrupulous research, drawing on Ulbricht’s diary entries and the chat history found on his laptop, makes this defense seem absurd. Yet the book’s cinematic approach means there’s little room to explore some of the larger questions the case raises. For instance, if the creator of Silk Road is responsible for illegal trade on the platform, do the supporters of bitcoin, who now include executives from the world’s largest financial institutions, bear responsibility for facilitating that trade? Even more pressing, if it took federal investigators two years to stop a dorm room libertarian, how effective can they possibly be against the professional cybercriminals we now face?"
2017-04-25T20:30:09.248Z,The Daily Prophet: Even Wall Street's Biggest Bull Says to Chill,"Robert Burgess
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-25/the-daily-prophet-even-wall-street-s-biggest-bull-says-to-chill-j1y0a1kh,"It was another day of superlatives for U.S. stocks as the Nasdaq Composite Index closed above 6,000 for the first time and the Dow Jones Industrial Average reclaimed the 21,000 level in intraday trading. That cued the naysayers to again trot out the charts to back their claims that equities are grossly overvalued by just about any measure. Although such warnings seemingly have been around for almost as long as the more than eight-year-long bull market, they are worth noting when Wall Street's most optimistic strategist lends credence to the idea that stocks have reached levels that are hard to justify. Deutsche Bank Securities Chief Global Strategist Binky Chadha said in a Bloomberg TV interview that ""it's time for a sort of a pause"" in equities and that ""you don't want to be too overweight right now."" In the latest Bloomberg News survey of strategists, Chadha had the highest year-end forecast for the S&P 500 Index, or 2,600. The benchmark closed today at 2.388.61. Here's a sobering factoid: Almost half the Nasdaq's run-up since Jan. 26, when the index first crossed 5,500, can be attributed to gains in Google parent Alphabet, Amazon.com, Apple, Facebook and Microsoft. The group also accounts for about a third of the S&P 500's rise this year, according to Bloomberg News' David Wilson. The latest move higher in stocks was being tagged to optimism for the Trump administration's coming tax plan and strong earnings from Caterpillar Inc. and McDonald’s Corp., which raised optimism that first-quarter profit growth will, in fact, match the heady 14 percent growth being estimated by strategists. Stock market valuations have become divorced from reality as the likelihood of policy changes that would drive company earnings has slipped, according to David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital. ""The bulls explain that traditional valuation metrics no longer apply to certain stocks,"" the firm wrote in a letter to clients Tuesday that was seen by Bloomberg News. ""Perhaps as the prospects for tax reform have dimmed, the market has regained enthusiasm for profitless companies that aren’t at risk of paying taxes.""BOND BULLS RECEIVE A COLD WARNINGDon't look for cover in the bond market. U.S. Treasuries are just as overvalued, according to Franklin Templeton star bond-fund manager Michael Hasenstab. He called government debt one of the world’s biggest financial bubbles, saying investors seeking safety in the securities face the prospect of significant losses as yields rise. Hasenstab, who manages the $40 billion Templeton Global Bond Fund, cited a variety of factors behind his bearish wager, from higher consumer prices brought by a hot U.S. job market, to a Federal Reserve that’s behind the curve, to the retreat of foreign buyers. It’s a major trade he’s held onto since at least 2015, even as yields fell to record lows last year. Buying Treasuries is “like walking on a lake in April,"" he said. “It’s still frozen, but eventually it’s going to crack.” The market for Treasuries has now fallen in six of the past seven trading days. TRUMP CLIPS THE LOONIE'S WINGSIt's the Canada dollar's turn to take a hit from the Trump administration's trade policies. The loonie, as the currency is known for the aquatic bird on the C$1 coin, fell to a four-month low after the U.S. slapped tariffs of up to 24 percent on imported softwood lumber from its northern neighbor. The Canada dollar is now the second-worst performing major currency this year, surpassed only by the Turkish lira. The tariff was an easy target for Trump given the long-running dispute between the two nations on the issue, according to Bloomberg News' Ben Bartenstein and Lananh Nguyen. ""Protectionist tariffs weren’t in the price for the Canadian dollar and the Mexican peso had priced it out,” said Bipan Rai, senior foreign-exchange and macro strategist at Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce. ""Ahead of the Nafta negotiations, markets have become somewhat more sensitive that talks won’t be as smooth as expected previously."" CHINA STOCKS ARE LOOKING A BIT TOO SHAKYIt's been a while since concerns about the health of China's economy and financial system rattled global markets. That may be about to change. Lost amid all the focus on the rebound in global equities from the talk of U.S. tax cuts and a favorable outcome in the first round of the French elections has been the quiet collapse in Chinese stocks. An intensifying crackdown against leverage in Asia’s biggest economy has rocked Shanghai Composite Index over the past week, sending it to a three-month low, according to Bloomberg News reporters in the region. Chinese officials have mainly kept mainland stocks on a tight rein after routs in mid-2015 and the start of 2016 reverberated through world financial markets. Until Monday’s 1.4 percent slump, the Shanghai Composite Index hadn’t fallen more than 1 percent for 86 trading days. “The Chinese government is squeezing speculation out of the market and while investors adjust, it will inevitably lag behind other parts of the world,"" according to Daniel So, a strategist at CMB International Securities Ltd. in Hong Kong. BITCOIN BACK ON THE MOVEBitcoin is approaching its record high after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it will review a decision it made on March 10 that blocked a proposal by the Winklevoss twins for a publicly traded fund based on the digital currency. That dashed hopes that a government-approved investment vehicle would lead to wider interest in virtual money. The SEC at the time refused to grant an exemption that would have let the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust trade on the Bats BZX Exchange. That decision ended a months-long rally that pushed the price of one Bitcoin to $1,327.1926, or more than one ounce of gold. Bitcoin then tumbled as low as $939.7946 late last month before rebounding to as high as $1,286.9850 today. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are the brothers famed for their dispute with Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of Facebook. TEA LEAVESInvestors expecting a detailed plan when the Trump administration lays out its tax reform proposals Wednesday are likely to be disappointed. What they will get is a broad set of principles that includes calling for a cut in the federal corporate tax rate to 15 percent from 35 percent as well as consideration of a child-care tax credit, a senior administration official said. It's debatable whether that will be enough to keep investors' newfound animal spirits alive, especially after President Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that “Big TAX REFORM AND TAX REDUCTION will be announced"" on April 26. If there's one thing executives of public companies have learned, it's that the key to making investors happy is to underpromise and overdeliver. That's a lesson the Trump administration seems to have yet to learn. If you’d like to get The Daily Prophet in e-mail form, right in your inbox, please subscribe to this link.

2017-04-24T08:57:40.885Z,Israel Indicts Hacker Linked to Threats on U.S. Jewish Centers,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-24/israel-indicts-hacker-linked-to-threats-on-us-jewish-centers,"Jerusalem (AP) -- Israel indicted an 18-year-old American-Israeli Jew on Monday for a wave of bomb threats against Jewish community centers in the United States that stoked fears of a rising wave of anti-Semitism. Israel's Justice Ministry said the accused was charged at a district court in Tel Aviv for thousands of cases of extortion, publishing false information that caused panic, computer offenses and money laundering. On Friday, he was charged in federal court in Orlando, Florida, with 28 counts of making threatening calls and conveying false information to police. Separately, he was charged with three more counts of cyberstalking in an indictment filed in federal court in Athens, Georgia. The Israeli indictment says that in addition to the Jewish centers, the accused also targeted airports, malls, police stations and Republican state Senator Ernesto Lopez from Delaware. He also offered his intimidation services over the internet in return for compensation in Bitcoin. Israel has not identified the suspect because he was minor when he committed the alleged offenses in the country. But the American indictment identified him as Michael Ron David Kadar. Kadar was arrested last month after a trans-Atlantic investigation with the FBI and other international law enforcement agencies. U.S. Jewish groups welcomed the breakthrough in the case, which had drawn condemnation from President Donald Trump. Since Jan. 9, there have been more than 150 bomb threats against Jewish community centers and day schools in 37 U.S. states and two Canadian provinces, according to the Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish group that battles anti-Semitism. The threats led to evacuations, sent a chill through local Jewish communities and raised fears of rising anti-Semitism. Acts of vandalism on Jewish targets, including cemeteries, have added to those concerns. U.S. authorities have also arrested a former journalist from St. Louis, Juan Thompson, for allegedly threatening Jewish organizations and charged him with one count of cyberstalking. But Israeli police described their man as the primary suspect in the wave of threats, numbering more than 2,000. Police said he used sophisticated ""camouflage technologies"" to disguise his voice and mask his location. They said a search of his home uncovered antennas and satellite equipment. The indictment says his motive was to cause public alarm. Among the charges against him are making a bomb threat against an El-Al flight to Israel that sparked fighter jets to be scrambled, and threatening a Canadian airport, which required passengers to disembark in emergency slides. Six people were injured. He was also accused of threatening a Virgin flight that as a result dumped eight tons of fuel over the ocean before landing, and threatening a plane being used by the NBA's Boston Celtics. In addition to threatening Lopez, he is also charged with harassing former Pentagon official George Little and threatening to kidnap and kill his children. Kadar's lawyer says he has a serious medical condition that might have affected his behavior. She said the condition had prevented him from attending elementary school, high school or enlisting in the army, which is compulsory for most Jewish men."
2017-04-20T23:01:00.004Z,BBVA Taps Blockchain to Make International Payments in Seconds,"Edward Robinson
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-20/bbva-taps-blockchain-to-make-international-payments-in-seconds,"Blockchain may finally be moving out of the lab and into the marketplace. Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria SA, Spain’s No. 2 lender, has executed its first cross-border payments through a system based on the software that supports bitcoin, the company announced Friday. Using a program built by Ripple, a San Francisco firm, BBVA has transferred about 50 euro-denominated payments to Mexico from Spain in seconds. Such transactions normally take up to four days to clear, the bank said. BBVA plans to use Ripple’s distributed ledger offering to provide corporate customers a quicker and cheaper way to pay overseas suppliers and execute other international transactions, said Alicia Pertusa, head of the lender’s Digital Transformation in Investment Banking unit. Processing payments on Ripple costs, on average, 81 percent less than the correspondent banking network that’s been used to send payments around the world for decades, according to the company. Ripple also lets companies track their payments like a FedEx package and see precisely how much it will cost to complete the transfer. The current method, which relies on the 40-year-old Swift messaging system, is incapable of providing either of these services. It’s also too rudimentary to convey details on what payments are for. This dearth of data has forced companies to maintain costly accounting operations to reconcile their overseas transactions. ""It’s not just the real-time transfer that’s important here but the information we can send with the payment,"" Pertusa said. ""That’s very relevant for our clients because they could begin streamlining their reconciliation systems."" The bank plans to offer a small group of clients the chance to begin testing Ripple’s service in a few weeks, she said. Financial institutions are striving to turn expectations around distributed ledger technology into reality. In March, a consortium led by Synaps Loans LLC -- a joint venture of data provider Ipreo and blockchain startup Symbiont -- used the innovation in a trial to automate trading in the leveraged loan market. Nasdaq has been using blockchain to process and record trades of privately-held shares. And R3, a New York-based consortium of more than 80 financial institutions, including Barclays Plc, Credit Suisse Group AG and HSBC Holdings Plc, has released its source code so developers can build applications for Corda, its distributed ledger platform. Four-year-old Ripple is betting the international payments system, which processes more than $20 trillion in transactions annually, is ripe for an overhaul. The company has formed partnerships with Bank of America Corp., UBS Group AG, and Standard Chartered Plc, among other firms. Last May, employees at Banco Santander SA’s U.K. division started using Ripple’s cross-border payment app internally. But Ripple may never become a true alternative unless BBVA and other partners begin accepting payments from one another on its network. Getting competitors as complicated and conservative as banks to join forces is no mean feat. ""We are talking to several institutions, "" said Marcus Treacher, Ripple’s global head of strategic accounts. ""Negotiations are ongoing."""
2017-04-17T14:15:00.002Z,Goldman's Global Tech Development Head Jessop Leaves for Chain,"Matthew Leising
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-17/goldman-s-global-tech-development-head-jessop-leaves-for-chain,"Blockchain startup Chain Inc. hired Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s Tom Jessop as president, bringing aboard an executive who helped make the bank an early Wall Street investor in the bitcoin-related technology. He joined Chain on Monday, reporting to Adam Ludwin, the chief executive officer, Ludwin said in a phone interview. Jessop, 50, who worked at Goldman Sachs for 17 years, was global head of technology business development and before that a senior leader in the principal strategic investments group, deciding what exchanges, electronic trading systems and financial-technology firms the bank would invest in. Chain, which last year pitched Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen on the benefits of blockchain, is one of several startups trying to entice industries from finance to health care and utilities with the promise that the digital-ledger software can radically improve how payments are tracked, securities and derivatives trades are processed, and health records are stored. Credit-card powerhouse Visa Inc. is one of Chain’s partners. “With Tom joining, he brings essentially the financial services experience and commercialization focus to the company,” Ludwin said. “He’s built exchanges, he’s built post-trade systems. He joined Goldman Sachs to build an e-trading system.” Read More: Bitcoin Was Cool, But Its Blockchain May Be Useful Goldman Sachs invested in Circle Internet Financial Ltd. in 2015, with Jessop involved in the deal. It was one of the first times a major bank backed a company using blockchain for payments, he said in an interview. Jessop will split his time between Chain’s headquarters in San Francisco and its new office in New York, which Jessop will run, according to Ludwin. While the technology has grabbed Wall Street’s attention, blockchain adoption has significant hurdles to overcome, such as convincing competitors to work together in a network that shares market information. Few, if any, applications of blockchain have been publicly released so far. Executives including Blythe Masters, CEO of another blockchain startup called Digital Asset Holdings, say it’ll take five to 10 years for blockchain to transform industries. Jessop agreed that the technology faces regulatory challenges, and that it’s no guarantee that you can change people’s behavior because you build a better mousetrap. A lot of his time at Goldman Sachs, however, was spent weighing consortium proposals with other banks and firms, where a key to success is getting others to buy in to an idea, he said. “I’ve always believed in a regulatory setting, the technology is the least important factor to consider,” he said. “My experience is highly complementary to what Chain is trying to do.” Ludwin first met Jessop when Chain was trying to win an investment from Goldman Sachs. Though the bank didn’t give Chain money, Ludwin was impressed by Jessop, who was the first person he’d met in a bank who truly understood blockchain, he said. “Tom and I hit it off and said, ‘Hey, we should keep it going,’” Ludwin said. When the time came to add an executive, Jessop was at the top of his list. “I called him up and I said, ‘Would you be excited to take a massive pay cut and come join the company?’” Ludwin said. Jessop laughed when told of Ludwin’s comment. “That’s the part I’m trying to block out of my mind,” he said. “That’s what you deal with when you move from Wall Street to a startup, but I’m really excited.”"
2017-04-18T13:08:36.787Z,Proxy Fights and FX Fixes,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-18/proxy-fights-and-fx-fixes,"Arconic. This is just conjecture, but I get the sense that Arconic Inc. Chief Executive Officer Klaus Kleinfeld didn't especially like spending time with the activist investors at Elliott Management Corp. Even back when relations were cordial, before Elliott launched a proxy fight and called for Arconic to get rid of Kleinfeld, this happened: That is going to be my all-purpose brush-off from now on. ""Sorry, I'm not free for lunch this week, but I think I'll have a spare 20 minutes at Davos this year, want to meet up then?"" It accomplishes so many goals, so efficiently. I would never want to be the CEO of a big public company, but it seems like the tradeoffs are pretty straightforward. On the plus side, you get paid a lot, and you get to boss a lot of people around. On the minus side, as Lucy Kellaway points out, it is stressful, and ""you spend your life in two of the most depressing spaces on earth — meeting rooms and aeroplanes."" And certain natural human behaviors are just closed off to you. For instance, when a famously mean hedge fund calls for your board to fire you, and mounts a big public campaign criticizing your leadership, you can't send them a nasty abusive threatening private response, no matter how much you want to. I mean, you can do it. Kleinfeld did! You just have to stop being CEO shortly afterwards. Kleinfeld did! ""Mr. Kleinfeld stepped down as Chair and CEO by mutual agreement,"" Arconic announced yesterday, ""after the Board learned that, without consultation with or authorization by the Board, he had sent a letter directly to a senior officer of Elliott Management that the Board determined showed poor judgment."" Honestly that seems like a fair trade? Sending a nasty letter to a shareholder you don't like -- Elliott says it ""read as a threat to intimidate or extort a senior officer of Elliott Management based on completely false insinuations"" -- is a pretty satisfying way to stop being CEO. (Better than how Kleinfeld left Siemens AG, anyway, ""as the company worked to recover from a bribery scandal."") It is not ideal for the company, though. Elliott's proxy fight continues. ""Importantly,"" says Arconic, ""this decision was not made in response to the proxy fight or Elliott Management’s criticisms of the Company’s strategy, leadership or performance."" Still, I mean: Elliott said the CEO had to go, the board disagreed, and then it turned out that the CEO really did have to go. How could you not score that as a point for Elliott? They certainly do: Honestly I'm mostly disappointed that neither side has chosen to publish Kleinfeld's letter. It must be pretty good! The London Fix. Remember the foreign-exchange trading scandal? Basically reference foreign-exchange rates were set during one-minute ""fixing"" windows every day, and clients would ask to buy currencies at those fix rates, and the banks would agree to sell to them at those fix rates, and the banks would take the risk that they could actually execute -- actually buy the currencies -- at those rates. That is a risk for the bank, which means that it comes with a reward: If they could buy at better rates than the fix rates, they could make a profit on the trade. There were various ways for the banks to do that, some pretty illegal (sharing customer order information with each other) and others not especially illegal but still sort of ugly-sounding if you haven't thought about them. For instance, banks that knew they would have to sell euros to customers at the fix would buy a lot of euros sloppily in the minute leading up to the fix, pushing up the fixing price, since they knew that the customer was on the hook to buy them. That was fine! That was the point of the fix, really: The customer got the convenience of being able to buy at a fixed price; the bank got the ability to ""pre-hedge"" to manage its risk, and the pre-hedging moved the price in the direction of the customer's demand.  Anyway the banks were all fined a lot of money, mainly for the illegal collusion, though there was a lot of non-binding regulatory huffing about the legal-but-ugly stuff. Then the banks all sent out notices to customers apologizing for the collusion, and half-apologizing for the legal-but-ugly stuff, and also quietly informing them that the legal-but-ugly stuff would continue. But here is a National Bureau of Economic Research working paper from Takatoshi Ito and Masahiro Yamada looking into the banks' actual behavior after the settlements (and some related changes to the FX market, like widening the fix window to five minutes and trying to limit customer-flow conflicts of interest). The results are kind of what you'd expect: Banks cut back on some legal-but-ugly behavior, which led to increased risks and costs for them, which led to increased costs for their customers. Particularly fun is that, early on, the banks played too nice, and got picked off by other traders: A basic problem in financial markets is that you want to do transactions with people who are good at doing transactions, because they will do a good transaction for you. But if you do transactions with people who are too good at doing transactions, they will do a good transaction to you. If you are a customer looking to buy euros from a bank whose trader is an idiot, you may end up getting a bad price, because she will overpay for euros and pass the cost on to you. But if you buy euros from a bank whose trader is a genius, you may also end up getting a bad price, because she will find ways for you to overpay her for euros. It is not obvious how to address this dilemma with regulation. It seems like post-scandal FX market reform has, in effect, made the banks dumber, but it's not obvious that that's better for the customers. Larry Fink. Quick question: If someone called you ""the most powerful man on Wall Street,"" would you consider that (a) a compliment or (b) an insult? If you chose option (a), BlackRock Inc. Chief Executive Officer Larry Fink agrees with you:  If you chose option (b), I kind of want to hear from you? Who would take it as a negative? Anyway Schatzker's interview with Fink is interesting throughout, though the highlight for me might have been learning that Fink is responsible for Maroon 5: In more financial news, here is Fink on exchange-traded funds: This is a generally useful way to think about financial markets: As you build new tools to do a basic thing more efficiently, people don't just keep doing that basic thing more efficiently. They use those tools to move to higher level of abstraction; they build more complex strategies that use the basic thing as inputs.  This has implications for fees. The paradigm I often think about is cheap electronic trading of stocks, which destroyed banks' profit margins on trading cash equities, but which led to huge new profit opportunities in derivatives trading and structuring that wouldn't have been possible if the banks couldn't trade stock efficiently. Similarly with ETFs, if the model is ""everyone will just index now and pay a few basis points,"" then the asset management industry's profit margins are in trouble. If the model is ""now active managers have cool efficient new ways to do asset allocation and 'navigate beta for alpha,'"" then there are a lot of opportunities for active managers to make money.  Portlandia. This story so perfectly takes city-council divestment efforts to their logical extreme that at first I assumed it was a parody: But no, it is real. Portland ""will likely see a drop in revenue of $4.5 million a year when the $539 million now invested in companies is moved to federal bonds and other places."" ""We can rest assured in Portland that our money won't be funding prisons, pipelines and the occupation of Palestine,"" says an activist named Amanda Aguilar Shank, who is going to be disappointed when she learns what federal bonds are used for. ""There is no ethical consumption under capitalism"" is a phrase that comes up surprisingly often in this financial newsletter, but really, if you want to divest from modern capitalism, just getting rid of corporate securities is not going to cut it. Any securities -- any financial assets -- are suspect. You have to start paying city retirees in local assignats, or compost, or bitcoins. A good hedge fund. Arjun LP is a hedge fund run by Joseph A. Meyer that is distinguished by (1) never losing money, (2) guaranteeing investors that they will never lose money, and (3) explaining how it makes its money by saying things like ""I’ve got a spreadsheet that did the calculations"" and ""All it does is look at the last trade and calculate trades that would be equivalent of, 'What if this security increases 50 percent in value in the next three seconds.'"" Sadly, the Securities and Exchange Commission is now investigating Meyer, Arjun, and Statim Holdings Inc. (Meyer's firm), after Georgia regulators found ""multiple irregularities."" Statim's lawyer explained to Bloomberg's Simone Foxman, Matt Robinson and Margaret Newkirk that it is all a misunderstanding, and their fault: I'm sure that this will all blow over once the SEC sees the spreadsheet.  ""The worst thing that happens is that I lose some money and maybe make a public idiot out of myself."" That's a quote from Doug Derwin, who is spending some of his venture-capital wealth to buy billboards urging Elon Musk to stop hanging out with Donald Trump. So he means it in a very straightforward literal way. But it would also be a good motto for an activist hedge fund, or any hedge fund, or any investor really. Certainly for Portland's city council. It should be the first risk factor in every initial public offering prospectus. Of course it is an extraordinarily optimistic statement. Neither of those things is particularly bad. Really it is a good aspirational motto for the utopia of late capitalism. We should all dream of a world where the worst thing that happens is that we lose some money and maybe make public idiots out of ourselves.  People are worried about equity compensation. Look, it is a bit of a cheat for me to have all these recurring section headings like ""People are worried about ____,"" as though it's unusual or noteworthy for people to constantly have the same recurring worries about a bunch of different things. People worry about stuff! That is the nature of financial markets, and of humanity, really. If I started a section called ""People are worried about adorable puppies,"" I am sure I could find material to fill it every day. (Important note: Please do not send me material for this hypothetical section; I will block your email address.) There just aren't too many news stories that couldn't be headlined ""People Are Worried About ____."" Anyway though here is a post from Mercer Capital's Financial Reporting Blog that is actually headlined ""People Are Worried About Equity Compensation."" I'm sure they are! People are worried about unicorns. I get nervous about linking to fake news here, so in an abundance of caution I will remind you that Clickhole is not real, but anyway here is a Clickhole article titled ""Getting Out Ahead Of This One: Uber Has Apologized In Advance If Anyone Finds Out About Something Called ‘Project Judas,’"" and that one feels like it'll be real in a week or two. Meanwhile in real news, ""Theranos Inc. and its founder pledged to stay out of the blood-testing business for at least two years in exchange for reduced penalties from federal health authorities, in an agreement that resolves a year-long regulatory impasse."" And: ""Scientists find giant, elusive clam known as ‘the unicorn of mollusks.’"" Poems. Here's a poem about Tax Day from Fortune's Jen Wieczner, if you're looking for pretty esoteric last-minute ways to put off filing your taxes. It has a sort of political theme. ""Plus, it had also become harder / To convince some people it was fair / That they had to file their tax returns / When the President's were God knows where."" Elsewhere, Anthony Lane wrote a poem about ""The Fate of the Furious."" Food Stuff. Mermaid toast, sure. Things happen. Goldman Sachs Falls Short on Earnings, Revenue Estimates. (Earnings release.)

2017-04-13T13:25:48.723Z,Listing Standards and Dividend Shares,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-04-13/listing-standards-and-dividend-shares,"Listing standards. A slightly odd fact about global capital markets is that public companies with dual-class shares -- where insiders can have a majority of the votes without a majority of the economic interest in the company -- are allowed in the U.S., but not in a lot of other places. This means that founders in other places who want to go public but retain control of their companies often want to list in the U.S. The other places don't love losing those listings, which leads to a bit of a race to the bottom. ""Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. in January said it would look again at dual-class shares more than a year after its regulator turned down the idea,"" and Singapore is also considering it, though there are objections: Of course BlackRock and OTPP buy lots of U.S. stocks, including dual-class ones. They just feel bad each time they do it. My natural inclination is to disagree with them on the listing-standards point: Companies are essentially negotiations among entrepreneurs and investors, and if big grown-up companies want to sell stock without selling control, and big grown-up investors like BlackRock and OTPP want to buy that stock without getting control, then why should regulators stop them?  But as we discussed the other day, the investors don't always get a choice. BlackRock, for instance, runs a lot of index funds. (OTPP does not, but it does benchmark to various indexes.) If a company with dual-class shares is in an index, BlackRock more or less has to buy it, no matter what it thinks about its governance. BlackRock has, in a large chunk of its business, given up the ability to make its own decisions about whether to buy a stock -- which gives entrepreneurs a lot more leverage on governance terms. Whatever the entrepreneurs offer, index funds can't say no! Of course index providers can say no, so they have become a popular place to contest governance issues. (FTSE Russell, for instance, ""plans to consult with investors and other stakeholders over the next few months about whether to include companies with no voting rights in its indexes."") But, as I have said before, it's a weird role for them: Really they're just in the business of writing down lists of stocks in a country, or a sector, or the world; they're not in the business of evaluating proper corporate governance. But stock exchanges -- for some reason -- are in that business. There is a long tradition of corporate governance standards being imposed by stock exchanges, as ""listing standards,"" a sort of seal of approval that listed companies have been screened by the exchange and found to be plausible investments. So the New York Stock Exchange regulates director independence and shareholder voting and other governance obligations of companies listed on NYSE. And the exchanges in Singapore and Hong Kong -- for now -- prohibit dual-class shares in companies listed on their exchanges. And of course keeping a stock off an exchange is one way to keep it off an index. I mean, index methodologies vary, but in general a stock listed on no exchanges won't be on many indexes, and a stock listed on a U.S. exchange might be left off some Asian indexes. ""This stock is not listed on an exchange"" (or ""on a particular exchange"") is a good simple objective criterion for index providers to use in choosing whether to leave it off the index, a clean division between what is in the investable universe and what isn't. If investing is increasingly about buying everything in the universe, defining the universe becomes crucial. Listing standards don't just limit what stocks investors can buy; they also limit what stocks investors have to buy.  Einhorn vs. GM. Ooh: Einhorn and GM disagree, essentially, about whether Einhorn's proposed ""Dividend Shares"" would be treated by ratings agencies like preferred stock (meaning that they're partly debt-like and would hurt its credit rating) or like common stock (meaning that they're not). Greenlight says that GM ""substantially altered"" its Dividend Share termsheet to present to the ratings agencies to make the shares seem more credit-negative. When we talked about the Dividend Shares, I called them ""preferred stock,"" so I guess you know whose side I'm on. The point is pretty basic: Einhorn thinks GM could be more valuable if it split its stock into Capital Appreciation Shares and Dividend Shares. GM, and the ratings agencies, meanwhile, are worried that splitting the stock would reduce GM's financial flexibility: If it is running low on money, it will have a hard time cutting the dividend on the Dividend Shares, which have ""Dividend"" right in their name. Einhorn disagrees: ""They would have the same problem with that as they do today,"" he told Business Insider. There is some technical sense in which that is true: The board can cut the dividend now, and it could cut the dividend after Einhorn's proposed split. But the whole point of the proposed split is that it will increase the value of the company by making investors value the dividend more. ""GM's dividend is not respected by the market,"" says Einhorn's presentation. So he'd make the market respect it more, by splitting it into its own separate instrument and finding yield-focused investors to buy it. Of course those investors, in that instrument, would be more concerned about dividend cuts than the current investors. That's the only way Einhorn's proposal could create value: by making investors count on the dividend more. If you make the dividend more salient, cutting it will be more salient too. Desk commentary. We talk a lot about sell-side research around here, but we also talk occasionally about ""desk commentary,"" research's pushier cousin. Research is supposed to be driven by an objective search for truth, untainted by crass commercial considerations like drumming up business. Desk commentary is just a form of sales. If a salesperson emails a client and says ""hey do you want to buy some XYZ stock?,"" that is sales. If she emails and says ""hey we are seeing a lot of activity in XYZ stock and I think it could be a good trade for you right now,"" that is desk commentary. (Or sales. The point is, there's not much difference between them.) If she changes her job title to Research Analyst and sends you an eight-page PDF with a title (""XYZ Co.: The best days in the widget business are still ahead"") and a rating (""Conviction Buy"") and a price target (""$28""), then that is research. Research is heavily regulated, needs to be shared with all clients at the same time, and needs to reflect the analyst's honest beliefs. Sales is ... sales. Desk commentary is ... also sales. Research is sales too, of course -- why would a bank pay for research if not to sell stock? -- but a more genteel and indirect form of sales. Anyway the problem is that people might confuse desk commentary with research, or more to the point that desk commentary might get caught up in regulations meant to cover research. So the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority has proposed a safe harbor to exempt desk commentary from research rules. Here is some of the reasoning: Of course that is exactly true of research too: Institutional investors make their own investment decisions, and incorporate research ""as a data point into their own analysis"" rather than relying on sell-side analysts to tell them which stocks to buy. The important difference between research and desk commentary is that the latter is only sent to institutions: The safe harbor requires that it be produced by non-research personnel, be ""limited to brief observations"" without a price target or rating, and ""only be distributed solely to consenting investors that meet the definition of 'institutional account.'"" If you only send your commentary to big investors who know how the game is played, it's fine. If you send it to retail investors, it is heavily regulated.  United. We talked yesterday about how, if you owned United Continental Holdings stock, you lost a bit of money on Tuesday on the negative reaction to United's invocation of state violence against a passenger, but if you owned all the airlines, you made money, suggesting that the violence was good for the industry as a whole. One shouldn't take that too seriously -- the stock price moves were all small and noisy, and it seems unlikely to me that United's recent public-relations troubles will have much business effect one way or the other -- but if one did take it too seriously, one might consider it evidence for the theory that companies with diversified investors might act differently from companies whose investors own only their stocks. In that vein, reader Ben Appen sent me an email that I think is the best analysis I have read of the United fiasco, so I will just reproduce it for you here: Obviously the ""low cost"" end of the market is in fact crowded -- literally! -- but I like this idea. Being so bad that your competitors can charge a premium just for not being you might be bad for your business, but if your shareholders also own your competitors then it might leave them better off. Elsewhere, here are Derek Thompson on the ""Cult of Low Prices"" in air travel, and Farhad Manjoo on ""How Technology Has Failed to Improve Your Airline Experience."" About $500,000 of United's chief executive officer's bonus is tied to customer satisfaction surveys. And United is going to give refunds to everyone who watched that guy get dragged off a plane, which seems a little random, but okay. A dog. Here is a profile of Scott Minerd, a fund manager at Guggenheim Partners, who has tried to analyze himself with diagrams: We talked yesterday about the inscrutability of artificial intelligence, the worry that deep-learning technology will produce investment recommendations for reasons that its human handlers can't understand. But as reader Ryan McCullough pointed out to me, that is a little true of human intelligence too: Lots of talented human fund managers will produce investment recommendations for reasons that their human colleagues, investors, etc., can't quite understand. Sure you can list some heuristics, but in many cases the heuristics are insufficient: ""XYZ Co. seems well-managed and underpriced"" is a comprehensible-sounding reason to buy its stock, but it doesn't exactly explain how you got to those conclusions. I guess if you build ""a coolheaded, calculated process with scalable, replicable results,"" that is better. Though that sounds like the sort of process that should be automated. Anyway! If anyone ever writes a profile of me in a magazine, it had better end with me and my dog leaving to chase squirrels: A bull. I don't know, I think I'm with the ""Charging Bull"" sculptor, Arturo Di Modica, who is complaining that State Street Corp.'s ""Fearless Girl"" statue distorts his art. As Christina Cauterucci writes: The problem is not what the ""Fearless Girl"" means; it's that she has changed what the ""Charging Bull"" means. The guy made a guerrilla sculpture of a bull to celebrate the resilience of capitalism, and now a giant investment firm has turned his bull into a sexist child abuser as part of an advertising campaign. Of course in a larger sense his sculpture is about the unbridled inhuman power of Wall Street, so maybe he should be happy to be trampled by State Street. Blockchain blockchain blockchain blockchain. Here's an article about how nobody uses bitcoin, still: Also, yesterday, in talking about the United fiasco, I said: My point was that, as we have discussed, early smart contract experiments have tended to privilege the technical language of the contract -- the ""immutable, unstoppable, and irrefutable computer code"" -- over the reasonable expectations of the parties. The United situation shows some of the problems with that: It turns out that people don't always want companies to enforce the fine print of their contracts literally. (The blockchain would have no qualms about dragging you off a plane if its algorithm randomly selected you!) But today Cowen linked to a paper by Omri Ben-Shahar and Lior Strahilevitz of the University of Chicago on ""Interpreting Contracts via Surveys and Experiments,"" whose basic point is that if you want to know how to interpret a consumer contract, you can just go ask a bunch of consumers. Combine a smart contract with an online polling mechanism -- say, a contract-interpretation captcha -- and you're getting somewhere. How to tell if your CEO has given up. Here's a story about Qingan Huang, a management academic who has built a machine to decide if chief executive officers are going to get fired: Hahaha I hope no one analyzes my wr -- I mean, this is a wonderful idea that makes me happy and fills me with joy and contentment and delight and glee and all-around bonhomie. I am sure that I will think about it fondly tomorrow, and next week, and in the third quarter, and in 2018, and over the coming decades. People are worried about unicorns. ""London’s First Fintech Unicorn Says Brexit Means It Would Look Elsewhere Now,"" it says here. The unicorns are plunging into the sea to flee the Enchanted Island. Fortunately Dublin is only a short swim away. People are worried about bond market liquidity. Well, the Bank for International Settlements is worried about repo market functioning, anyway: The BIS blames regulation and also ""exceptionally accommodative monetary policy, which provided ample central bank liquidity to the market and reduced the need for banks to trade reserves through the repo market.""

         & Stepan Kravchenko
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-10/russia-caves-in-on-bitcoin-to-open-new-front-on-money-laundering,"Only a year ago Russia’s Finance Ministry was threatening jail time to anyone using digital currencies. In a major U-turn, it’s now edging closer to their acceptance as a legitimate financial instrument to open a new line of attack on money laundering. The authorities hope to recognize bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in 2018 as they seek to enforce rules against illegal transfers, Deputy Finance Minister Alexey Moiseev said in an interview. The central bank is developing a joint position together with the government on digital currencies, according to its press service. “The state needs to know who at every moment of time stands on both sides of the financial chain,” Moiseev said. “If there’s a transaction, the people who facilitate it should understand from whom they bought and to whom they were selling, just like with bank operations.” While bitcoin isn’t regulated by any government, it has come under increasing scrutiny in some countries as a way to shelter assets from the authorities or launder ill-gotten gains. In China, which has occupied a central role in trading and mining bitcoin in recent years, the three largest exchanges imposed a moratorium on all coin withdrawals in March as the central bank issued new guidelines on their use. Tracking cryptocurrencies could become the latest tool enlisted in the Bank of Russia’s battle against money laundering, which has seen hundreds of lenders lose their licenses over the last three years. The plan to legalize and monitor bitcoin is taking shape as traditional schemes are drying up, with dubious operations such as fake trades and loans used to move money abroad dropping by half to $771 million last year, according to central bank data. Bank of Russia Deputy Governor Olga Skorobogatova said in February that the authorities would decide if digital currencies can be considered as asset, cash or security by mid-2017. Initially, cryptocurrencies in Russia are most likely to be bought via bank accounts in order to make online purchases, with some also acquired as a speculative investment, Alfa-Bank Vice President Oleg Legostev said in comments emailed by the lender’s press service. Bitcoin rose 1.1 percent to $1,215.85 at 10:09 a.m. in New York on Tuesday. It has gained 28 percent since the start of the year. Foreign banks have sometimes been swept up in investigations of Russian schemes. Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc received information requests from the U.K. in March in relation to an alleged money laundering ring that moved money through Moldova and Latvia between 2010 and 2014. Deutsche Bank AG in January was fined $629 million by U.K. and U.S. authorities for compliance failures that saw the bank help wealthy Russians move about $10 billion abroad using transactions that may have covered up financial crime. Crime, corruption, and tax evasion spawned at least $211.5 billion in illicit Russian outflows between 1994 and 2011, with illegal transfers reaching $552.9 billion, according to Washington-based Global Financial Integrity.   Bitcoin was the first digital currency to achieve a measure of popularity, thanks to its use of blockchain, an online ledger that tracks and verifies every time the virtual money is used. It’s faced some criticism from those who say the software it relies on is too rigid to gain widespread acceptance, with hipper investors moving on to the more sophisticated record book used by Ethereum. — With assistance by Anna Baraulina"
2017-04-06T08:00:30.206Z,Your Tax Refund Is Selling Cheap On the Dark Web,"Suzanne Woolley
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-04-06/your-tax-refund-is-selling-cheap-on-the-dark-web,"Tax season is hog heaven for cybercriminals. The thought of all that personal data just sitting around, unmolested in tax documents, inspires a torrent of creepy scammer creativity. Then the warnings tumble in: We’re warned about attempts to steal our data in emails from the IRS; our companies assign us courses on how to identify phishing emails; we read about the latest victims in the news.What we don’t see is how our tax data is bought and sold, and what scammers charge other scammers for our data. The Krebs on Security blog provided a glimpse earlier this year, when founder Brian Krebs came across something he hadn’t seen before on the Dark Web: Bulk sales of W-2 forms. A scammer had phished a tax preparation firm, Krebs discovered, and was offering for sale 3,600 Florida W-2s in this cyber netherworld which, while connected to the everyday web, requires special software or authorization to access. Another window into that world comes in a new report from IBM’s commercial security research team, Cybercrime Riding Tax Season Tides. The company has skin in the game—it sells services to protect companies from cybercrime—which means it’s also in a good position to see what’s going on in scamland. To get a sense of the rise in potentially malicious tax spam emails, IBM’s security research group—the IBM X-Force— checked its spam traps for specific, common tax-themed spam.
            
                
                1
            
         IBM’s traps capture 20 million new spam samples per day, according to the company. The group found an increase of more than 6,000 percent in the number of common tax scam emails trapped by its system from December 2016 to February 2017. A more general search on “tax” spam found an increase of 1,400 percent over that period. It’s like bears heading for the river as the salmon move upstream. The fruits of all the successful phishing attempts wind up on the Dark Web. These offers can look run of the mill, complete with star ratings for sellers. Here is a screenshot showing sellers and their illegal wares, such as W-2s, taken from IBM’s report:  One vendor noted on his sale of W-2s that it “comes with 2015 data to fully complete the return.” The IRS requires the prior year’s adjusted gross income (AGI) on a return, so that costs a would-be scammer extra. One vendor IBM found was selling W-2 and 1040 returns as a package for $30 worth of bitcoin; if someone wanted AGI information, that was $20 more. Another cybercriminal had a bulk offer that promised data that was “fresh” for the 2016 season, and included W-2 data, date of birth, and the AGI figure. That was $50 in bitcoin per record. An individual’s tax data is far more valuable than their credit card data. Stolen credit card data might sell for $1 or be given away to establish credibility on the Dark Web, said Limor Kessem, executive security adviser of IBM Security. Credit card accounts can be closed or frozen, and thus have a short criminal-shelf life. “Tax filing information is probably the most premium type of record criminals can buy on the underground,” said Kessem, who has been tracking this world for eight years. “It goes for $40 or $50, and unlike credit cards, never expires. People can try and get loans in someone’s name, make fake IDs in people’s names, get credit.” And of course, the top target is filing a tax return in someone's name and getting the refund.
            
                
                2
            
        The Dark Web has its own selling language. “Fullz” means complete information on an individual, including, according to the IBM report, “payment card information, address and contact details, and other additional pieces of personally identifiable information, such as Social Security number, a driver’s license number, and any other information sold along with the set.” A Fullz file of data is labeled “superior” if it also contains W-2 and W-9 info. That sells for $40 in bitcoin per record. See the lingo in action in the screen shot below. (IBM blacked out identifying information.) Would-be fraudsters browsing these sites are offered tutorials advertised with smiley little tax returns with arms and legs. These crime lessons are a longtime staple on the Dark Web, used as a way to build credibility with the community and get invited into other forums, said Kessem. Such honor among thieves would be almost heartening if the damage wreaked on everyday taxpayers wasn’t so heinous. With phishing attacks on the rise, a consumer’s best defense is a good offense. One of the simplest, when it comes to tax refund fraud: File your taxes early to beat would-be scammers to the punch. Phishing emails are designed to tempt or panic people. Reminding yourself that the IRS will not send e-mails about your income tax return gives you the upper hand. No matter how enticing—or scary—the supposed offer or threat is in the supposed IRS letter, which will try to entice you into clicking on a link, or opening a file, resist, and forward the fishing attempt to the IRS at phishing@irs.gov. Consider it a small step in an ongoing war."
2017-03-31T13:27:55.594Z,"Hedge Funds, Analyst and Car Loans","Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-31/hedge-funds-analyst-and-car-loans,"Research. What do sell-side equity research analysts do? There are three main theories: Theory 1 seems naïve: It's the investors' job to pick which stocks to buy, and it would be strange for them to outsource that job to research analysts with no skin in the game. Theory 2 is the knee-jerk cynical opposite of Theory 1, but it also doesn't seem to fit the facts. Theory 3 is, it seems to me, the realistic theory, describing a business that customers might actually want. Here is a working paper from Nathan Swem of the Federal Reserve about ""Information in Financial Markets: Who Gets it First?"" The simple model here is: The hedge funds are good at finding undervalued stocks, so they do, and they tell the analysts, and the analysts write up reports, and the stocks go up until they are fairly valued, and the hedge funds sell them and move on to the next trade. It's an efficient market, but one that relies for its efficiency on hedge funds (who are actually making investment decisions) rather than on research analysts (who aren't). This is perfectly reasonable! As David Keohane puts it at Alphaville: But there are other possible models. For instance, here is Dan Davies in the Alphaville comments: That is: It's not that hedge funds tell analysts which stocks to buy; it's more that analysts share parts of their ideas with hedge funds in inchoate form, before they end up publishing them in research notes. ""The published reports are the tip of the iceberg,"" Davies writes; ""the real product of the analysts is the ongoing conversation."" Either of those explanations -- analysts are doing hedge funds' bidding, or analysts are talking to hedge funds before they publish their notes -- would make you angry if you are a firm believer in Theory 1. The job of an analyst, in that theory, is to discover independently which stocks will go up, and then say so in published research available to all clients at the same time. (Either explanation is just irrelevant to Theory 2, with its curiously narrow focus on investment banking fees.) But Theory 3 -- the idea that research is a client-service business, one that involves a back-and-forth conversation and different services to meet different clients' needs -- can handle them both. Elsewhere in research, ""about 40,000 research reports are produced every week by the world's top 15 global investment banks, of which less than 1 percent are actually read by investors,"" which seems a little harsh. (And hard to explain on Theory 1!) And here's a study of research in the Chinese financial markets: Subprime car settlements. It's all happening again: That's from the Massachusetts Attorney General's announcement of a $22 million settlement with Santander Consumer USA Holdings Inc. for subprime auto lending. (Delaware had a parallel settlement with Santander for $2.875 million.) Santander didn't actually make auto loans, but it did fund loans for car dealers, and then it packaged and resold those loans to investors. And the loans were bad, and Santander knew or should have known, and so forth: As with the mortgage settlements, the basic theory is that Santander (through dealers) made loans to consumers that it knew they couldn't pay back, and then sold those loans to investors. To the state attorneys general, it seems clear that this conduct harmed both the consumers (whose credit was damaged and who might have their cars repossessed) and the investors (who bought loans that defaulted). But it's much easier to prove the latter than the former: Taking money from investors and not giving it back seems like fraud, while giving money to consumers and not getting it back seems like a ... present? So these cases tend to be brought on fraud-like theories, focusing on the claim that banks deceived the buyers of the loans (who lost money) rather than the borrowers (who got money, and who probably weren't deceived by inflated claims about their own incomes). But the states' real concern is with the consumers, not the investors: Of the $22 million Massachusetts settlement, $6 million will go to the state and $16 million to consumer relief. Zero dollars, it appears, will go to the investors who bought Santander's loans.  Insider whatever. Maybe the most embarrassing insider trading case I've ever seen is this action from the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority against Christopher Niehaus, a former Jefferies Group LLC managing director. There wasn't even any trading! Sometimes Niehaus would share confidential information about clients with another client, and with a friend of his, but neither Niehaus, the client nor the friend ever traded any stock, and Niehaus didn't expect them to. The FCA fined him 37,198 pounds for ""failure to act with due skill, care and diligence,"" not for insider dealing. It was just insider gossip. But the really sad thing was Niehaus's reason for sharing the information: He was a managing director at an investment bank! His friends probably could figure out that he was doing deals. This is not how to impress anyone. Also he did his gossiping over WhatsApp. That's not embarrassing for him, just for me; he's a decade older, but more fluent in social media than I am. It's the FCA's ""first action related to a messaging app,"" reports Bloomberg. Elsewhere in WhatsApp. Lots of banks prohibit employees -- or at least traders -- from using personal phones, text messaging, WhatsApp, etc. for work purposes, but ""nearly two dozen employees who spoke with Bloomberg say those policies are routinely ignored and the use of personal phones for work is a fact of life."" And: For most of human history, people could have business conversations without worrying that one day a prosecutor would be able to search a transcript for uses of the word ""Muppet."" But email and instant messaging created, in Dan Davies's words, a ""golden age"" for regulators in which ""traders have inadvertently made wrongdoing by people in their ranks as easy as possible to detect."" That golden age happened to coincide with a global financial crisis, and a lot of wrongdoing was detected. The lesson that banks learned from this episode was that they should build better tools to monitor email and detect wrongdoing earlier. The more intuitive lesson that bankers learned was that they should start using WhatsApp.  Stock trading is really efficient. Remember when high-frequency traders were a shadowy elite of stock-market insiders who got rich by stealing billions from ordinary investors, a fraction of a penny at a time? I am constantly reading articles these days about how high-frequency trading firms are sad and merging because they can't make any money. Meanwhile equity trading revenue at big banks is also down. It's almost like the story of high-frequency trading is that some disruptive new firms built electronic systems to displace the inefficient expensive trading services offered by incumbent banks, and then competition drove down prices so much that even those disruptor firms can't make outsized returns any more. But who would find a story like that compelling? Advertising. Here is a story about how JPMorgan Chase & Co. used to advertise on 400,000 websites every month, and now it only advertises on 5,000, and ""the company is seeing little change in the cost of impressions or the visibility of its ads on the internet."" I hope that they don't draw any broader lessons from the experiment: I bank at Chase and work in Manhattan, and I find it very convenient that there are 400,000 Chase ATMs within a block of me at all times. I would be sad if they cut that down to 5,000. But this is also a fascinating media-business story. JPMorgan was doing programmatic ad buying, buying ad space on thousands of websites in bulk through advertising networks. That is a standard feature of life on the internet, and has led to the rise of huge internet companies, like Alphabet Inc., that run on advertising revenue. Of course there was a pre-internet advertising ecosystem where newspapers and television were much more central. If you wanted to advertise, you'd call up the New York Times and buy an ad, because that was where the ads were. Now the ads are everywhere, so the way you advertise is by sending an order to an ad network and getting filled with a few million impressions, somewhere out there on the internet. But there is a lot of terrible stuff out there on the internet, and one thing that has happened in the last few weeks has been that reporters at newspapers have called up advertisers and said ""hey do you see the terrible stuff that your ads are appearing next to?"" And the advertisers have pulled the ads, which has been bad for business at Alphabet (which owns Google and YouTube). The standard internet model of putting ads next to everything is under pressure, as advertisers are realizing that ""everything,"" on the internet, means mostly racist videos. So what do you do, if you're JPMorgan, and a New York Times reporter calls you up to tell you that your programmatic ads are appearing on a fake news site? You might cut back your programmatic buying, and buy advertising only on individual sites that serve up content that you trust. (""JPMorgan has limited its display ads to about 5,000 websites it has preapproved, said Kristin Lemkau, the bank’s chief marketing officer."") That would be great for the newspaper business! Traditional news organizations, after all, put a lot of money and effort into making sure that their websites are free of fake news and racist rants. If there's a backlash against the just-put-it-anywhere ethos of advertising on the internet, that will benefit traditional arbiters of truth and newsworthiness. It's a nice revenge of traditional journalism against Google. Art. Part of me hopes that Larry Fink will buy this installation after the Whitney Biennial ends, except that it sounds ... sort of ... bad: I think we are about a decade away from an art world in which artists will put little kneeling figures of Steve Cohen in all of their works, like donor portraits in Renaissance religious art, but you can tell that the artists are a little uncomfortable about it. People are worried about bond market liquidity. Here's a Federal Reserve discussion paper by David Arseneau, David Rappoport and Alexandros Vardoulakis on ""Private and Public Liquidity Provision in Over-the-Counter Markets"": How should you make banknotes? Somehow the Bank of England is making polymer banknotes out of animals, which is controversial, so it's thinking about making them out of palm oil instead, which is also controversial: It's almost like there is no such thing as ethical consumption under capitalism. England should convert to using bitcoins, which are made out of electricity. But so much electricity. ""Why you shouldn’t answer the phone when your bank calls."" The answer, according to Maria LaMagna, is that it's probably a phishing scam, but the real answer is that you shouldn't answer the phone when anyone calls. Probably delete all your emails, too, just to be safe. And WhatsApps from investment bankers. Food Stuff. ""Spaghetti Donuts Are Here — and You Can Get Your Own Starting This Weekend."" There is a surprisingly long article about this. Elsewhere, McDonald's Corp. will switch from frozen to fresh beef in its Quarter Pounders. ""I'm just terrified about this,"" says a Quarter Pounder eater. Also: bugs.  What? In Money Stuff yesterday, I wrote that David Einhorn could buy General Motors Co. stock for $35, sell the dividend rights for $19, sell the appreciation rights for $33, and make $8 per share doing it, except that it would be too weird to work. A few people pointed me to sort of similar schemes that had sort of worked in the past, but only one person emailed to complain about the math. I'm a little embarrassed for all of us, frankly.

2017-03-31T12:00:14.486Z,"FundersClub, Where Folks Can Back Startups Online, Says It's Beating the Pros","Eric Newcomer
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-31/fundersclub-where-folks-can-back-startups-online-says-it-s-beating-the-pros,"The 2012 Jobs Act let regular Americans invest in startups, spawning a glut of crowdfunding sites offering real ownership stakes in return for cash, rather than the new smartwatches or electric skateboards available on pioneering platform Kickstarter. One of these ""equity crowdfunding"" firms, FundersClub Inc., says it's beating most of the pros. In its first three years, returns outpaced the median venture capital fund and much of the industry's top quartile of investors, according to data provided by the company citing Cambridge Associates, which measures VC performance for pension funds and other institutional investors. FundersClub's net multiple -- investor returns after the company's cut -- is 2.26 from its 2012 investments, 3.24 from the 2013 vintage, and 1.17 for 2014. The median VC firm's net multiple for the same vintages were 1.25, 1.14 and 1.04, respectively, according to the data from FundersClub and Cambridge Associates. ""We started in 2012, and at that time, a lot of what we were doing was considered novel,"" said Alex Mittal, FundersClub's chief executive officer. ""Since then the idea of startup investing on the internet is less novel, but what has shockingly remained the case is this pretty high level of disinterest or lack of care for returns."" There are caveats. Most of FundersClub's returns are tied to the private valuations of the startups that it has backed. FundersClub sometimes holds startup investments at lower valuations than their last fundraising round, but it has still benefited from frothy, paper valuations. Of the $80 million that's been invested through FundersClub, only $3.3 million has been realized -- and some of that came in the form of more stock when portfolio companies were acquired by larger high-flying startups like Slack Technologies Inc. ""They have better paper returns than other folks -- if the asset class resets a bit, they'd be hurt less, you'd imagine,"" said Anand Sanwal, CEO of VC data firm CB Insights. ""We've been in this period of very frothy valuation increases so we have to see if these companies can exit at these valuations, and we haven't seen that for a while."" FundersClub's investments include the grocery delivery company Instacart Inc., now valued at $3.4 billion, logistics company Flexport Inc., the bitcoin company Coinbase Inc., and T-shirt e-commerce site Teespring LLC. Bloomberg Beta, the VC arm of Bloomberg LP, is an investor in Slack and Flexport.The site has a network of technology executives, founders, and other wealthy individuals who invest at least $3,000 per company. That's less than the standard early-stage startup investment minimum for individuals of about $50,000. The smaller check size opens up startup investing to more people, although FundersClub still requires investors to meet certain income or wealth requirements. Indeed, it dislikes the term ""equity crowdfunding,"" preferring to call itself an online venture capital firm. AngelList LLC, another equity crowdfunding site, takes a different approach. The firm helps individual ""angel"" investors raise money, creating what it calls syndicates and it also helps people invest in startups directly. AngelList says unrealized returns from its 2013 syndicates are 2.4. $525 million has been invested in 1,330 startups since its founding.  Equity crowdfunding hasn't become a booming business yet. Some members of Congress have floated passing legislation to let people become accredited investors on the basis of their financial know-how, not just their wealth or income. That's something Mittal believes could drive more people to startup investing. ""There is still mostly a focus on accredited investors so that hasn't brought in mom-and-pop folks -- which might be a good thing,"" Sanwal said. ""I don't think this has become this capital-markets sensation folks were maybe talking about a few years ago. It's still a tiny asset class that's part of a relatively tiny asset class."""
2017-03-29T13:36:01.651Z,Robot Funds and Consumer Relief,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-29/robot-funds-and-consumer-relief,"BlackRock. There's a negative way to look at the news that BlackRock Inc. is laying off a bunch of stock-fund managers to focus more on computer-driven quantitative strategies, and a positive way. The negative view is that it's tough out there for an active equity manager. It's hard to outperform the index. People don't want stock-pickers, and are moving their money to index funds. There is a lot of pressure on fees. It's a declining business, which is why BlackRock is slowly backing away from it. As BlackRock's Mark Wiseman puts it: (Another negative way to look at it is that it's particularly hard to be an active equity manager at BlackRock. ""The company’s active-equity funds have lagged behind rivals for years."") The positive way is something like: Equity mutual-fund management is a solved problem. What happened here, in the big picture, is that BlackRock hired a bunch of people to figure out how to pick stocks, and they figured out how to pick stocks, and they wrote it down, and now they can go do something else. The computers will take it from here. That isn't quite how the people involved will perceive it -- it's not like the human stock-pickers were directly working on the computer programs that will displace them, and the quants who were working on those programs will stick around to manage and improve them -- but it feels broadly correct. ""At the heart of BlackRock is a culture that embraces change and turns it into opportunity,"" says Larry Fink, BlackRock's chairman and chief executive officer, in the press release. When I think about computers replacing humans as mutual-fund managers, I like to think about driving. Self-driving cars are, you know, pretty good, right? They're not going to replace human drivers next week, but it seems like they'll get there eventually. Intuitively, compared to driving, investing seems: Driving is pretty easy! Lots of people can do it. And yet it requires constant instinctual processing of all sorts of visual information that is hard to codify into simple rules that a computer can manage. Meanwhile, active investing is really hard! Most people who do it can't beat the index. And yet it seems increasingly likely that most of the value that investment managers do add can be explained -- or at least imitated -- by looking at a bunch of numbers (historical stock prices, corporate earnings, etc.) and finding patterns in those numbers. Computers are really good at that sort of thing. (They have neural networks.) So of course robot-driven investment funds should be farther along than robot-driven cars, and fundamental equity mutual-fund managers should be at least as worried about their jobs as truck drivers are. But in another sense this is pretty weird. Investing is not really about finding patterns in a bunch of numbers. I mean, that is what it's about, but not at a deep level. Deep down, it's about finding good ideas, about understanding what humans will want and who will be best situated to give it to them. It's about figuring out which product will be the next Facebook and which will be the next Friendster, about figuring out who will be the next Steve Jobs and who will be the next Ken Lay. That process is at least as human and instinctual as driving; it takes its inputs from the whole world, and parses them through a deep understanding of human behavior. It seems like it should be hard for a computer to do that. But the computer doesn't have to. The market does that: People -- entrepreneurs and lenders and venture capitalists and, eventually, public-market stock investors -- make those evaluations, and express those evaluations in the form of prices, and ultimately those prices become the numbers that the computers examine to find patterns. The market is an amazing computer for turning all of those people's individual decisions into aggregated numbers. It just turns out that, if you plug an actual computer into the market, it makes better use of those numbers than the humans do. Elsewhere: ""Evidence That Robots Are Winning the Race for American Jobs."" And: ""America Must Divorce Dignity From Work."" Consumer relief. In the years leading up to the financial crisis, big banks did some bad mortgage stuff, giving borrowers mortgages that they probably shouldn't have given them and then selling those mortgages to investors. This bad mortgage stuff had bad effects on the borrowers, who often couldn't pay back their mortgages when the housing market crashed, and on the investors, who didn't get paid back. The government went after the banks for doing the bad stuff. Strictly speaking, the government went after the banks for defrauding the investors, rather than for harming the borrowers. This makes sense: It is easy to explain how the banks defrauded the investors by taking money from them that was not paid back, but it is harder to explain how the banks harmed the borrowers by giving them money that they didn't pay back. Nonetheless there was a strong intuition that the borrowers had been harmed, and so when the big banks reached their big mortgage-fraud settlements with the government, those settlements tended to include not just fines and repayments to investors, but also lots of money designated for ""consumer relief."" The idea was that the banks had harmed consumers by giving them mortgages that they couldn't pay back, and could fix that harm by modifying the mortgages -- writing down the principal or lowering the interest rate or whatever -- so that the consumers could pay them back.  This generally sensible idea ran up against some practical problems. For one thing, some of the banks that did bad mortgage things never actually made mortgages. They bought up other people's mortgages, and packaged them into securities, and the securities were bad, and they contributed to the crisis and so forth -- but they didn't have any consumers to relieve. I was puzzled, for instance, by the Goldman Sachs Group Inc. settlement, which earmarked $1.8 billion for consumer relief, even though Goldman didn't have a consumer mortgage business. Goldman figured out a solution: It buys other banks' mortgages at a discount, and then modifies those. Fine. Weird, but fine. Even weirder, Deutsche Bank AG -- also not a big U.S. mortgage lender -- incurred $4.1 billion of consumer relief obligations, which it fulfills in party by lending money to investors who buy mortgages and modify them. Again, an odd way to punish banks for the financial crisis (Larry Summers calls it ""a large systematic overstatement of the burdens borne by banks as they settled mortgage-related claims""), but consumer relief, sure. But there's another practical problem, which is that the financial crisis was almost a decade ago. There just aren't that many busted subprime loans from 2007 that Deutsche and Goldman can buy up and modify. So, reports Matt Scully, Deutsche has another idea: It is considering ""indirectly funding new loans to subprime borrowers."" Again: Fine! Subprime borrowers were harmed by the financial crisis, Deutsche Bank contributed to the crisis, and now Deutsche Bank will help them buy new homes. But it does seem a little far afield from the original idea of the mortgage settlements. That idea was that the big banks harmed consumers by giving them subprime loans, and should now help those consumers by writing off some of those subprime loans. Deutsche Bank might instead atone for its role in the subprime crisis by making new subprime loans. Wells Fargo. Look, I am not a consumer banker, but it seems to me that the right way to do that business would be: Obviously there are caveats -- you can't give a loan to everyone who wants one -- but it feels like a reasonable starting point. Wells Fargo & Co. seems to have started from the opposite end. Everyone knows about the fake-accounts scandal, in which Wells Fargo bankers realized that the easiest way to meet their account-opening quotas was by opening accounts for people who didn't want them, or even know about them. That resulted in a $110 million settlement with customers yesterday, with more perhaps still to come.  But Wells Fargo also got in trouble yesterday for failing its obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act, ""a 1977 law intended to promote lending in low-income neighborhoods."" While it was giving accounts to people who didn't want them, it was also unfairly denying loans to people who did. Well, not really. Its CRA scolding from its regulator, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, is sort of a weird document. Wells Fargo actually did a pretty good job of lending in underserved areas! (""WFB demonstrated lending levels that reflected excellent responsiveness to the credit needs in the majority of assessment areas,"" says the OCC, with lending market share exceeding deposit market share in most areas.) Instead, the OCC's list ""of discriminatory or other illegal credit practices"" that ""adversely affected WFB’s overall CRA Performance Rating"" consists mostly of older violations (including steering minority borrowers into subprime loans with high fees from 2004 through 2008), as well as the fake-account-scandal itself, which is bad, sure, but not a failure to lend in low-income neighborhoods. The OCC is harsh: I mean, you can see where they're coming from! Wells Fargo shouldn't have done this stuff, and the OCC is its regulator, and it would be a little weird for the OCC to just let an opportunity to yell at Wells Fargo slide. The best way to stop banks from doing bad stuff in the future is to embarrass them, over and over again, for the bad stuff they did in the past. Still I feel like there is a lot of this in current discussions of banks, a sort of everything-is-also-everything-else mentality that makes it hard to talk clearly about the actual problems. Wells Fargo opened lots of fake accounts, which is bad. It also does a good job of lending in underserved areas, which is good. But its report card on lending in underserved areas is Bad, because a general cloud of Bad hangs over Wells Fargo, infecting everything that it does. Even the things that are good! What's new in ride-sharing? ""Every strength, in excess, is a weakness,"" says Liane Hornsey, Uber Technologies Inc.'s chief human resources officer, in a moment of Pyrrhonian/Thielian skepticism. But what if her skepticism doesn't go far enough? What if, instead of every strength, in excess, being a weakness, every weakness, in excess, is really a strength? What if a lack of human-resources policies (Hornsey is pretty new), a flagrant disregard for the law, and a cruel corporate culture are the very things that made Uber the massive multinational company it is today? I guess we are saying the same thing. Anyway Uber released its diversity report, and it's not that bad! ""Compared with statistics at other technology companies, Uber’s diversity figures are not that different — and are modestly better than some."" Still: Hornsey ""added that Uber was creating a task force to pinpoint major human resources failings."" But Ellen Huet and Carol Hymowitz point out that ""the more illuminating piece of data about diversity at Uber isn’t in its report at all"": It doesn't report retention rates for different demographic groups. One theme that I have sometimes seen in Uber coverage is that Uber represents not just a terrible bro-y culture that needs to improve to become an acceptable semi-bro-y culture, but also an almost blank-slate opportunity to start over and create an ideal Silicon Valley culture. (Farhad Manjoo: ""This could be the start of a deep, long-term and thorough effort to remake a culture that has long sidelined women — not just at Uber but across the tech business, too."") I don't really get it: Intuitively, it seems to me that it would be easier to turn a very sexist company into a somewhat sexist company, or a somewhat sexist company into a not sexist company, than to turn a very sexist company into a not sexist company. That is just, like, geometry. But the Silicon Valley cult of Pyrrhonian skepticism has deep roots, and people can't resist the idea that the way to get an ideal corporate culture is to start with a terrible one. Coincidentally yesterday Uber competitor Lyft Inc. also released its own diversity report, which went like this: ""We’re woke. Our community is woke, and the U.S. population is woke. ... We’re not the nice guys. We’re a better boyfriend."" I guess that is not a formal diversity report. It was a Time interview with Lyft President John Zimmer. Still you get the idea. The battle lines are clearly drawn. Uber: Weakness in Strength. Lyft: Your Woke Bae. Elsewhere in ride-sharing, ""Didi Chuxing, a company in China that last year bested Uber in that huge ride-sharing market, is in negotiations to get SoftBank of Japan to take part in a multibillion-dollar investment round."" And elsewhere in tech-flavored car companies, ""Tencent Holdings, one of China’s internet giants, has acquired a 5 percent stake in Elon Musk’s electric-car maker Tesla."" Why aren't there IPOs? We talked about the declining attractiveness of public markets the other day, and I argued that it's not just a matter of increasing regulation: Instead, private markets have become more attractive, so there's just less need for even big multinational private companies to put up with the headaches of going public. But here is Steven Davidoff Solomon with a few more reasons, of which the most interesting might be that ""the drop-off in activity is largely attributed to the disappearance of the small offering"": Twenty years ago, when 54 percent of initial public offerings ""were considered small, with a market capitalization below $75 million in inflation-adjusted dollars,"" the stock market was a lot less concentrated in the hands of huge investment funds and ""quasi-indexers."" It is tough to make BlackRock, with its $5.1 trillion in assets under management, care very much about an IPO for a $75 million company.  Food stuff.  My Bloomberg View colleague Tyler Cowen is worried that we're spending too much time and energy on food, which makes us fat and sleepy, and not enough on music, which makes us sweaty and energized. ""Food,"" he notes, ""especially if combined with wine, encourages a state of satiety and repose."" Which is nice individually but might be bad for society. ""These days, it could be said that food is the opiate of the educated classes."" Elsewhere in food trends, with coconuts, ""getting to a smoother mouth feel is one big technical area."" At Olive Garden, shrimp scampi (500 calories) has overtaken chicken Alfredo (1,480 calories) as the best-selling dish. (""We started talking about the flavors first and the taste first,"" says Olive Garden's vice president of brand marketing about how it ... came up with ... the idea for ... shrimp scampi?) And: ASMR food. People are worried about unicorns. The hot thing for unicorns is not M&A any more; now it's IPOs again: Me yesterday. I wrote about David Einhorn's proposal to split GM's stock into two classes. Elsewhere, S&P Global Ratings and Moody's Investors Service don't like the idea. Things happen.

2017-03-23T18:45:14.040Z,"Post-Bitcoin Technology Has Geeks, Giants, and Hackers Excited","Matthew Leising
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-23/post-bitcoin-technology-has-geeks-giants-and-hackers-excited,"In late February about 200 executives, coders, and developers gathered in the downtown Brooklyn office of JPMorgan Chase & Co. to hear an all-day pitch for a new industry group called the Enterprise Ethereum Alliance. Ethereum? It’s the ghostly sounding name for a so-called blockchain technology similar to the one that made the digital currency bitcoin possible. Its inventor, Vitalik Buterin, released his software to the world in 2015, not long after dropping out of the University of Waterloo, in Canada. Less than two years later, JPMorgan, BP, Microsoft, International Business Machines, and ING are among the companies in the group experimenting with it. Buterin didn’t attend the EEA meeting, but he had a video message to deliver. Except the EEA couldn’t get the video to play, because the computer hosting it crashed. As the crowd began to stir, a frozen frame of Buterin’s face came on-screen, then he disappeared. After the tech crew scrambled for 30 minutes, they finally got it to work. It’s an apt metaphor for a technology that’s come with enormous promises but suffered setbacks almost from its inception. Last year, hackers stole $60 million worth of ether, the digital currency linked to Ethereum. The heist was a huge black eye—chances are, if you’ve heard about Ethereum, it’s because of the hack. And yet it isn’t dead. The reason: Unlike bitcoin, this blockchain isn’t really about currency. Its advocates think it could be a universally accessible machine for running businesses. “Ethereum gives you a new way for the computer to interact with the real world and how money moves,” says Emin Gun Sirer, an associate professor of computer science at Cornell University. “It’s potentially a huge game changer whose value has yet to be tapped.” To understand what the excitement is about, it helps to start with bitcoin, because without it, there would be no blockchain. Previous attempts to create digital money that could be sent as easily as email ran into a problem: How do you guarantee that each virtual dollar is unique, so the sender can’t spend the same cash more than once? For bitcoin, this is solved with blockchain, which is simply an online ledger book that’s distributed on computers around the world. It tracks and verifies every use of bitcoin. To give people an incentive to maintain the blockchain on their machine, it awards a number of new bitcoins to the first computer to verify a transaction. It’s like a banking system that runs itself—but its main use is just letting people move currency from point A to point B. Ethereum’s ledger does more. It can store fully functioning computer programs called smart contracts: If person A performs job B for company C, it will trigger a payment of D back to A … and so on. As with bitcoin, the ether currency is a lure to get people to lend the system their computing power, and you need it to participate in a contract. Think of Ethereum itself as a way for people to make agreements and automate enforcement, all on a distributed network of computers. Once you can create contracts—which in essence are just operating procedures—you can use them to manage almost any kind of enterprise or organization. For example, John Hancock Financial is experimenting with a tailored version of Ethereum to keep track of compliance with know-your-customer and anti-money-laundering regulations in its wealth management unit. Airline industry giant Airbus SE wants to know if its supply chain management can be shifted to a blockchain. Like David Hasselhoff, Ethereum is popular in Germany: Power producer RWE AG and online bank Fidor Bank are investigating ways to integrate it into their businesses. The 2016 ether theft showed that though Ethereum may be powerful, it’s still new and prone to mishaps. One of the first things people used ether for was to invest in a kind of decentralized venture capital fund built with an Ethereum smart contract. Investors could vote on how the fund’s ether would be used; hackers found a bug in the contract that forced the fund to funnel its ether to them. After much consternation, there was a vote in the Ethereum community, supported by Buterin, to edit the blockchain’s transaction history so it appeared as if the hack had never occurred. Blockchain purists were so enraged at the idea of fiddling with the ledger, they began supporting an alternative form of Ethereum, which they took to calling Ethereum classic. Buterin is unapologetic. “In general, the Ethereum community is on board with the notion that we do not have to do things exactly the way that things are done in other crypto communities,” he says. “I did not create Ethereum to let hackers get away with $60 million.” This is the stuff of passionate debates on Reddit forums, but it may not matter to corporate users, because many of them don’t want to work on the fully public Ethereum blockchain anyway. JPMorgan just released a version of Ethereum known as Quorum. Developers around the world can work with it, but only companies invited to participate will be able to record transactions and contracts on it. The Airbus blockchain would be similarly walled off. These blockchains would run alongside the main version of Ethereum, which anyone can use. “We’ve built an unstoppable, uncensorable world computer,” says Joe Lubin, founder of ConsenSys, a Brooklyn company that develops blockchain applications, speaking of Ethereum. Andrew Keys, head of global business development for the company, still sees the technology as a grass-roots tool for cutting out intermediaries of all kinds—from law firms to online social networks. “Our digital identity is on Facebook, and Mark’s getting paid,” he says, referring to Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg. “Instead of them housing that, we’ll have self-sovereign identity with peer-to-peer transactions.” In other words, instead of using Facebook to control who can and can’t see their family photos, people could one day set the rules themselves using smart contracts. Ethereum is still a long way from that kind of success in either its public or private forms. The public version needs significant upgrades to be able to handle anything like the volume of interactions on the internet today. Ethereum’s leaders, in their response to the hack, offended a substantial part of the blockchain development and programming community, which isn’t that big. On the business side, corporations have to be convinced that they won’t be giving away trade secrets through their use of a ledger shared with other companies. At the same time, they’ll need to keep the technology open enough so that anyone can put their ideas into the same Ethereum ecosystem. “I don’t want to build AOL,” says Amber Baldet, blockchain program lead for JPMorgan. “I want to build the World Wide Web.” The bottom line: Ethereum could present a whole new way to run a business, but there are some serious kinks to work out."
2017-03-27T13:26:29.445Z,Tontines and Marshmallows,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-27/tontines-and-marshmallows,"Tontines. Here is a fun story about the return of the tontine, the 17th-century financial innovation in which a bunch of people put money in a pot, agreed that whoever died last would get the whole pot, and then set about surreptitiously trying to murder each other and claim the prize. Or that is my general impression of tontines, and I am not alone: ""Works by Agatha Christie, Robert Louis Stevenson and P. G. Wodehouse all featured tontine members plotting to kill one another in hope of a big payoff."" (There's also a ""Simpsons"" episode.) Tontines have mostly disappeared, but there is ""a backward-looking cabal of financial specialists who suggest that this antiquated investment model may address modern challenges."" Needless to say, one of them ""envisions tontines layered with blockchain and smart contract technology."" (""Mr. Brownstein said the technology could help track whether tontine members were actually alive or dead."") The key challenge that they're addressing is longevity risk, the risk that people might outlive their retirement savings. The tontine would address this challenge by creating incentives for people to kill each other quickly. No, no, I'm kidding! I don't think that's the idea? The last year or so has been really hard on the notion that history is a linear progression from darkness to enlightenment, but it's been really good for theories of history as an endlessly recurring series of cycles. You see a bit of that in finance too: So much of ""financial technology"" -- bitcoin and blockchain and peer-to-peer lending -- is really about abandoning the modern technology of finance and returning to a simpler and more primitive time. (But with computers.) What if we got rid of the maturity-transformation function of banking and just loaned money to each other? What if we got rid of central banking and started mining our currency again? What if we got rid of securities regulation and just built a lot of pyramid schemes on a blockchain? None of this is driven by pure academic curiosity, or perverse destructiveness: It comes from a distrust of those modern institutions, a desire to return to olden times because the modern technology has somehow gone wrong. The tontine revival seems to fit with that spirit. We had discovered perfectly good risk-sharing mechanisms to deal with longevity risk: Social Security, defined-benefit pensions, annuities. But trust in that system is breaking down, so we're going back to the past. Maybe 21st-century capitalism will eradicate 20th-century risk-sharing mechanisms like pensions and throw us back on 17th-century ones like tontines. Marshmallow spoofing! Christopher Mims tried to buy some marshmallows on Amazon, and fell into a world of bots. Also a world of surprisingly expensive marshmallows: I still don't understand how the marshmallow trade works? What good does it do you to raise your prices and bait competitors into raising their prices to just beat you? Is it a latency arbitrage -- you pull their prices up, then drop yours and get the sale before they can react? (Why would that work?) Or is it a sort of antitrust-conspiracy-by-bot, where you all raise your prices and get outsized profits because none of your bots wants to be the first to defect from the cartel? There is something weird about a lot of discussions of high-frequency trading, on Amazon or on stock markets. The standard story about markets, generally, is that they are effective mechanisms for aggregating individually rational (that is: greedy) behavior into socially beneficial outcomes. The standard story about computers, generally, is that they lack many of our more appealing human qualities but are really good at cold calculating logic. You'd think that combining the two -- using computers to emphasize our most coldly rational and greedy qualities, and then using markets to aggregate those computers' individually hyper-rational behavior -- would work really well. I guess it does; that's why people keep doing it. But so much of what you read about computerized markets suggests that all this aggregating of rationality leads to irrationality, that individually rational decisions by a bunch of computers tend, when aggregated by the market, to lead to collectively absurd results. (There are also stories about how individually irrational decisions by computers -- coding errors, fat fingers, etc. -- lead to absurd results, but those are less interesting.) Somehow a bunch of hyper-rational robots competing to offer the best prices on a transparent electronic market end up offering ... worse prices? Is that a failure of the market, or of the computers, or of the combination of the two?  Would it be better for stock prices if stock prices went down? I love this stuff: And: The subtext of most quotes in newspaper articles about stock prices is ""I reject the efficient markets hypothesis."" If you say that stocks are overvalued or undervalued or down on profit-taking or up on short-covering, you are explicitly or implicitly substituting your view of value for the market's. Which is fine! Lots of people reject the efficient markets hypothesis, and everyone loves a narrative. But this goes one step further: It's not just that the market should be valuing companies more cheaply, but also that the market itself would feel better if it did. This is not just disagreeing with the market, it's condescending to the market; not arguing with the market, but telling the market that it's over-tired and cranky and would feel much better if it took a little nap. The Somali shilling. Here is J.P. Konig on the Somali shilling, ""a paper currency without a central bank"" since the Central Bank of Somalia stopped printing it in 1991: Isn't that sort of how bitcoin works? But the central bank is working with the International Monetary Fund to re-introduce official currency: Well, but: What does it mean to be a ""counterfeiter""? Classically, counterfeiters print notes that compete with notes printed by a central bank, hoping to capture some of the central bank's seignorage revenue. The Somali counterfeiters don't have a central bank to compete with, don't try very hard to imitate the ""real"" notes, and don't make much seignorage revenue either -- just enough to pay for the economic value they provide.  Elsewhere: ""With as many as 45 million British one-pound coins suspected fake, the Royal Mint is now making 1.5 billion new ones, which will enter circulation Tuesday."" I suppose the goal is to make them cost more than a pound to counterfeit. Bonuses. This is not the best look: ""Do we pay them a bonus for just coming to work,"" asks one investor, and of course the answer is yes. It's a conundrum. If you own a bad business, you still need to hire someone to manage it, and you need to give him the right incentives. If he achieves mediocrity, that is a big win for you; if you pay him only for excellence, he will have no incentive to shoot for mediocrity, and you'll end up with terribleness. Paying him a big bonus for achieving mediocrity is the right decision; it is embarrassing, but that is the sort of tradeoff that you end up making when you own a bad business. Amazingly Standard Chartered's 2016 incentive plan featured a bonus threshold of a 0.4 percent return on equity, and the managers missed it. Regulation. Here is an annoying article about how President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will be put in charge of a ""White House Office of American Innovation,"" which will be ""a SWAT team of strategic consultants,"" ""an incubator of sleek transformation,"" and ""an aggressive, nonideological ideas factory capable of attracting top talent from both inside and outside of government."" The article features Marc Benioff saying that Kushner ""does remind me of a lot of the young, scrappy entrepreneurs that I invest in in their 30s,"" presumably because he is in his 30s. And there is this, from Steve Schwarzman: That's a nice veiled description of Chesterton's fence: If you are trying to figure out what regulations impose costs without also providing any benefits, and you hire people from regulated industries who know about the costs (""at least see where the friction is"") but who don't see the benefits, then they will tell you to get rid of the regulations. Ideally you would also talk to people who know where the benefits are. It's also a nice illustration of my theory that there are two kinds of regulation: Custom regulations, which are created to serve some specific goal; and bulk regulations, which add ""friction to the system without accompanying it with significant benefits,"" are the subject of all discussions of ""regulation,"" and do not exist. ""It's easy for the private sector"" to tell which regulations are pointless red tape, says Schwarzman, but you'll notice he doesn't name any. Also Kushner is going to solve opioid abuse. And: ""Trump to Issue Far-Reaching Reversal of Obama Climate Push."" And: ""BlackRock and Vanguard call for delay to fiduciary rule."" And it's very easy for Carl Icahn, a ""special adviser to the president"" on regulation, to see which regulations cost his own businesses money, so he's going to get rid of them.  People are worried about unicorns. Here is Kadhim Shubber on liquidation preferences in later-stage venture capital: This seems like the sort of problem that could be solved by renegotiating the liquidation preferences: You go to the late-series investors and say ""look, I know I promised you the first $200 million of any sale price, but at current prices that doesn't really give me much incentive to work, so can we re-strike it to $100 million?"" (Public companies do something very similar, repricing underwater stock options to keep their executives incentivized.) Obviously the investors won't be happy, but the problem here is the misaligned incentives, and fixing it can be good for both the investors and the founders. If you pay only for excellence, the founders will have no incentive to shoot for mediocrity, and at this stage mediocrity is what you want. I guess that's harder to accept at a tech startup than it is at a big bank. Elsewhere, ""Uber Group’s Visit to Seoul Escort Bar Sparked HR Complaint.""

2017-03-22T13:07:51.096Z,Unicorn Swaps and Falling Complacency,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-22/unicorn-swaps-and-falling-complacency,"People want new ways to worry about unicorns. We talk from time to time around here about how to short unicorns. There is a popular view that many large private tech companies are overvalued; that this overvaluation is caused in part by the structure of the market, which encourages long investors but doesn't allow short selling; and that if you could just sell those companies short, you'd make a lot of money. Themes of our past discussions include: So much for the theory. Here is a Medium post from Avish Bhama of Mirror, who is actually trying to make unicorn swaps happen. His team met with 65 potential counterparties, got a sense of the market appetite, drew up an ISDA and ""partnered with a valuation firm to help us mark these illiquid swap positions on their books."" But he didn't find much of a natural two-sided market in most names, though interestingly the one-sidedness is not all on the short side: 1MDB. The Wall Street Journal reports that ""U.S. authorities intend to file criminal charges against"" Jho Low, the Malaysian financier at the center of the 1Malaysia Development Bhd. scandal. Low has been a target for a while -- the U.S. Department of Justice forfeiture complaint filed last year says that he ""laundered more than $400 million of the funds misappropriated from 1MDB"" and used them for ""personal gratification"" -- but he remained undaunted: I think that's the greatest (also only) financial WeChat I've ever read. Okay new rule: If you ever say that any financial market event is a ""perfect storm,"" you have to continue the nautical metaphor for at least a paragraph and follow the relevant ship all the way to port or to the bottom of the ocean, as the case may be. Like: ""The collapse of our biggest holdings combined with the lack of bond market liquidity to create a perfect storm, and we sank. Our chief compliance officer bravely went down with the ship, and was last seen being eaten by sharks. Our captain and a few trusted mates managed to get into a lifeboat, using the oars to scrape off several junior analysts who were clinging to the gunwales. They drifted for several days, and resorted to cannibalism quite a bit sooner than you might have expected, but most of them were eventually rescued by a passing multi-strategy fund and are now safe, dry and well-compensated. Happy New Year!"" Personnel moves. It seems to be an odd week for financial-industry hiring. For instance there is this, from Wells Fargo & Co.: What ... sort ... of academic? A pollster? A sociologist? An anthropologist? An ethicist? A management scientist? The answer says something about what they're expecting to find. If they hired an academic criminologist, that's probably trouble. Next: Oh yes right the goal of hiring a sports figure is to teach clients leadership and teamwork, not to plop a celebrity in front of the clients. ""How can we work better as a team,"" companies across Europe ask themselves, and the answer is overwhelmingly: ""Let's call Nomura and ask them to send us a rugby coach."" In less odd news, former U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara ""is joining the New York University School of Law as a distinguished scholar,"" which I guess technically makes him an academic, if that's of any interest to Wells Fargo. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. is hiring someone to help build ""a so-called robo-adviser geared to mass affluent customers."" (Also: ""Goldman Sachs is to start moving hundreds of staff out of London before a Brexit deal is struck."") And Paddy Power Betfair Plc., the Irish bookmaker, is looking to hire a ""head of Trump betting."" Insider trading. Thomas C. Davis, the former chairman of Dean Foods Co., testified yesterday ""that he had provided 'an enormous amount of inside information' about the company"" to Billy Walters, the sports gambler charged with trading on that information. Insider traders often have terrible tradecraft: All of that is sneaky enough to be suspicious, but not sneaky enough to foil suspicion.  Should index funds be illegal? Nah, suggests this Federal Reserve Board preliminary staff working paper by Jacob Gramlich and Serafin Grundl, who ""propose an alternative approach for analyzing the competitive effects of common ownership: to directly analyze the weights that firms place on each others’ profits rather than using measures of industry concentration.""  Bitcoin and scale. Here is Izabella Kaminska on the supposed purpose of bitcoin: Of course the financial-services industry has mostly moved on from its fascination with bitcoin, but you still see hints of the notion that ""the blockchain"" -- or a single unified blockchain -- could comprehend all of the world's financial transactions. A disclaimer. Here is a funny disclaimer from a penny-stock touting service, which was sent to me by a dentist, David Nelson, who says ""me and my other dentist buddies at work got a kick out of it."" So did I, and you might too, whether or not you are a dentist. It is incredibly honest! People are worried about unicorns. The board of Uber Technologies Inc. held a call yesterday to explain that everything is fine, this is fine, how are you: Put a bit too simply really! You know what Einstein supposedly said. Put less simply but more accurately, change starts one level below the top: Rather than replacing chief executive officer Travis Kalanick with an ""adult in the room,"" Uber's plan is to hire a chief operating officer to perform whatever operations are required to help Kalanick ""grow up"" himself. You can see the board's point though. Uber is facing a list of scandals and embarrassments too long to even summarize here, but on its key business metric -- rider growth -- it's still doing great. Of course sometimes businesses look at other metrics. Here is a story about the departure this weekend of Jeff Jones, Uber's president:   Things happen.

2017-03-23T09:00:52.229Z,This Gold Rally Has Recent History on Its Side,"Shelley Goldberg
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-23/this-gold-rally-has-recent-history-on-its-side,"Gold has staged an impressive rebound since the Federal Reserve raised interest rates last week and reiterated that the pace of increases will accelerate. But is a rally logical? Some would argue that higher rates portend faster inflation and that gold is a good hedge against inflation, thus validating a long gold position. On the flip side, post-rate hike rallies in gold can be seen as counter-intuitive for two reasons, the first being that the precious metal doesn't generate a yield. Warren Buffett once said during one of his Berkshire Hathaway annual meetings that if you owned all gold in the world, ""you could climb on top of it, fondle it, and declare yourself king, but you couldn’t earn anything on it."" The second reason is that when interest rates rise, the appeal of that nation's currency tends to increase, causing it to appreciate. But a stronger U.S. dollar is generally bearish for commodities, as most global commodities, gold included, are priced in U.S. dollars. What likely happened that speculators went long the dollar in anticipation of the widely expected rate hike and shorted gold. Once Chair Janet Yellen confirmed the rate increase, the speculators unwound their long dollar positions,  covered their short gold positions - likely at a profit. This practice, common during rate hike scenarios, was evident in the last two long-awaited quarter-point increases in December 2015 and December 2016. In fact, both of those cases resulted in bull runs not only for gold, but for other precious metals and for mining stocks that persisted for a few months. The Fed also stuck to its forecast for at least two more rate increases this year, unchanged from its December forecast for 2017, but Yellen’s tone continues to lean towards caution. That leaves policy makers room to maneuver in case U.S. growth falters, inflation tapers, or President Donald Trump’s policies become economically disruptive. So will there be another extended gold rally and will this same scenario play out during the anticipated hikes later in 2017? The answer may be more easily derived from flipping a gold coin as a myriad of factors, both macro-economic and geo-political, could feasibly reverse gold’s direction. It is likely, nevertheless, that the trading scenario above will be repeated and even more likely that anticipation of additional rate hikes will heighten volatility in both the gold and currency markets. But the problem with gold in many of these recent rallies is that, much to the dismay of gold bugs, the metal has continued to face resistance. Just when gold looks like it’s braced for a sustainable move up, it loses steam and trends back down.  This ""gold ceiling"" arises for a number of reasons, with the most obvious being good old supply and demand. Today the dominant perception is that there’s simply too much of it around to get investors worried, particularly while gold’s price is well above miners’ marginal cost of production. Additionally, U.S. equity markets are performing well (outside of recent days)  and emerging markets are providing decent investment opportunities, thus there’s no evidence of a strong flight to quality. And those who mistrust fiat currency regimes are flocking to bitcoin as an alternative. Gold is like a Hollywood celebrity.  Sometimes it’s hot and in the limelight while other times its waiting for its next big role. With a dearth of news in the gold markets, and investor distraction over things like U.S. Presidential tweets, the Russian playbook and European populism, gold is not making enough front page news. The advisable way to trade gold during this Fed cat and mouse rate game is to trade in and out of it. It’s wise to try and gauge the interest-rate language around Fed statements to determine which way the  dovish/hawkish scale tilts. A good practice is to always maintain a long gold position along with an above-the-market sell-limit order.  Once the sell order is executed, wait for a dip in price and start all over again.  The same exercise can be accomplished by selling out-of the-money gold calls against a long gold position, whereby one not only gains from gold’s upside, but also takes in option premium.  There’s no substantial reason for gold to drop precipitously from current levels but as a hedge, a stop limit sale below the market is as advisable.

2017-03-15T05:27:40.125Z,Divisive ‘Bitcoin Unlimited’ Solution Crashes After Bug Discovered,"Yuji Nakamura
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-15/divisive-bitcoin-unlimited-solution-crashes-after-bug-exploit,"A controversial plan to fix bitcoin’s network congestion suffered a setback after attackers used a newly-discovered bug to crash the software. Bitcoin Unlimited, which had been attracting support from the digital currency’s biggest miners, was attacked after developers brought the bug to light. The numbers of ""nodes"" hosting Unlimited fell to about 300 from 800 following the attacks, the lowest level since October, according to website coin.dance which tracks industry data. That figure bounced back to about 800 within 24 hours after developers patched the bug. Nodes make up the core of bitcoin’s infrastructure. Those with mining abilities shoulder a significant workload of verifying transactions with specialized computers, while non-mining nodes independently track those transactions and effectively ensure the entire network is functioning as expected. By running a certain version of the software, such as Unlimited, each node can signal how they want bitcoin to evolve. While the exploit was quickly patched, it is validation to critics who say Unlimited programmers lack the experience to fix bitcoin’s complicated congestion issue. Unlimited had in recent weeks won the backing of influential miners, as some decided to give up on reaching a community consensus after more than two years of discussion. The bug raises uncertainty about whether miners will follow through on their support. The Unlimited side wants to remove a pre-programmed cap on the amount of data bitcoin’s network can process, which they argue can end congestion. Opponents say removing the limit would put too much power in the hands of large organizations who have better resources to process large amounts of data, potentially undermining bitcoin’s independence from governments and global banks. They’ve offered to ease the congestion with an approach called SegWit, which uses a slightly different method to verify transactions. Both sides took to social media to celebrate or defend their respective camps. The community has grown increasingly polarized as bitcoin’s underlying network has become more backlogged than at any point in the currency’s eight-year history. — With assistance by Lulu Yilun Chen"
2017-03-16T00:00:07.278Z,Someone Wants to Stick a Fork in Bitcoin,"Elaine Ou
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-16/someone-wants-to-stick-a-fork-in-bitcoin,"A dispute among the people involved in bitcoin is revealing a paradox of the digital currency: The same resistance to human meddling that drove its popularity may also be its greatest limitation. It seems that the only way to get anything done is to split the currency in two. At issue is the size of blocks, the batches in which transactions are processed and that make up the links in the so-called bitcoin blockchain. Currently, they’re so small that the whole system can handle only about seven transactions per second -- nowhere near enough to compete with, say, Visa network’s 24,000 transactions per second. Some people think that’s a good thing! Bitcoin relies on thousands of internet-connected volunteers, and their operating costs should be kept as low as possible. On the other hand, many are unsatisfied with the system’s speed. A faction known as Bitcoin Unlimited has released a new version of the software that can create bigger blocks, and is now rallying the support of bitcoin miners, who process transactions in return for new currency. The plan is to gain enough miner support to build its own branch off the chain. Meanwhile, the computer geeks who develop the core bitcoin software have offered their own solution, which not only increases capacity but also enables the creation of low-value payment channels adjacent to the main network -- the idea being that people might not need every coffee purchase immortalized on a global distributed ledger. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain The standoff illustrates a vulnerability. Because bitcoin relies on a worldwide network of individual computers to maintain the blockchain, one group can -- intentionally or not -- become separated from the rest.
            
                
                1
            
         The two networks will thus accumulate different information, creating competing chains. If the “fork” is unintentional, the networks eventually reconnect and discard the lesser chain.
            
                
                2
            
         But if the fork is intentional, as in the case of Bitcoin Unlimited, it can continue forever. The insurgents’ software will eventually disconnect from anyone who doesn’t support their blockchain. The most troublesome part is that both sides want to assume the identity of bitcoin. This would be like the Confederate states seceding from the Union, then insisting that they were the real United States and that the northern states had voluntarily left. Ultimately, it will be up to individual users to either choose one chain or recognize both as legitimate currencies. This is one reason it’s so hard to tame bitcoin by, say, creating an exchange-traded fund so regular investors can get a piece of the action. The ETF filing for the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust actually includes a provision specifying which bitcoin network it will support in the event of a split.
            
                
                3
            
         Another ETF filing for Grayscale’s Bitcoin Investment Trust acknowledges that the fund will end up with equal values of two types of bitcoin, and must select one to keep in the fund. Thus far, Bitcoin Unlimited has secured support from the world’s largest mining operation, as well as adoption from about 10 percent of the bitcoin network. Unfortunately, the campaign suffered a minor setback this week thanks to a software bug: Past rebellions have eventually faded. To make a credible attempt at a coup, Bitcoin Unlimited must recruit major exchanges, wallets, and other service providers. It’s not easy: People who treat their digital currency as real money tend to be risk-averse when it comes to new software. Even the developers of core bitcoin have not yet gained enough support to activate their upgrade. While the impasse might be aggravating for those who find bitcoin transactions too sluggish, it’s far better than a blockchain that is too easily modified. After all, immutability is supposed to be a feature, not a flaw. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

2017-03-20T13:12:14.619Z,Mortgage Math and Sympathetic Sales,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-20/mortgage-math-and-sympathetic-sales,"Mortgage relief. We talked on Friday about Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s consumer mortgage relief program, which is complicated by the fact that Goldman doesn't have a consumer mortgage business. But it owes the government $1.8 billion of consumer mortgage relief, and so it is buying up delinquent Fannie Mae loans at a discount and restructuring them with the dual aims of (1) providing consumer relief and (2) making the loans worth more than it paid for them. It is an odd way to penalize Goldman for its role in the mortgage crisis: If Goldman buys a loan at 60 cents on the dollar, it can forgive 30 cents of principal and still make a 10-cent profit.  But Deutsche Bank AG has an even odder way to get consumer relief: Deutsche Bank just needs to be somewhere in the general vicinity of a mortgage that gets modified: If an investor buys a loan at 60 cents on the dollar, forgives 30 cents of principal and makes a 10-cent profit, Deutsche Bank can get 30 cents of loan modification credit for lending the investor 45 cents. (Terms ""include lending up to 75% of the total purchase price of loan portfolios with rates of around 2% above a benchmark rate known as Libor."") Goldman's consumer relief seems likely to turn a profit, but at least it's actually modifying the loans, and directly taking the risk that some of them won't work out. Practically and economically, Deutsche Bank is even more insulated. Now, I know what you're thinking: What if Deutsche Bank loaned Goldman $60 to buy mortgages with a face amount of $100, and Goldman wrote down those mortgages to $70, sold them for $70, paid $5 in interest to Deutsche and kept $5 profit for itself? Would Deutsche and Goldman both get credit for $30 of consumer relief? (Is that not what you were thinking?) Hahaha no the footnote in Deutsche's settlement actually covers that case: Presumably the hardest part of Deutsche Bank's consumer relief program is finding people to buy and modify mortgages who don't have their own Justice Department settlements. Sales and advice. One thing that we sometimes talk about around here is how the financial industry likes to collapse the distinction between sales and advice. The way to sell someone a derivative, or an extra bank account, is to create the impression in his mind that you are his friend and trusted adviser, concerned with his problems and interested only in solving them, not in grubbing money for yourself. Then, when he sues you for ripping his face off on the derivative pricing, you go to court and say: ""What? I was an arm's-length counterparty, not a fiduciary; I don't see what the problem is here."" But finance isn't the only industry that does this. Sales is a pretty well-studied business, and basically everyone in any kind of sales business has figured out that trusted advisers are better salesmen than salesmen are. So the way to sell a pencil is not to sell the pencil -- ""this pencil writes great!"" -- but rather to ask the customer about her hopes and dreams and problems and accomplishments, elicit from her the heartbroken confession that sometimes she needs to mark up memos but isn't at a computer, and then slide the pencil across the table to her with a meaningful nod. Later you send her the bill.  This sort of ""consultative selling"" can shade into self-parody, and here is Scott Edinger on its silliness. ""The kind of questions sales professionals are taught to ask typically focus on drawing attention to client problems, pain points, and sources of dissatisfaction,"" he writes, ""so the client will then view the seller’s offerings as a solution."" It's not so much an open-minded conversation about the customer's hopes and dreams as it is a series of questions leading subtly but inevitably to the PencilMatic 3500X solution. Or not so subtly: As a former investment banker, I cringed with recognition. It turns out that if you just have a free-form conversation with a corporate chief financial officer about his daily frustrations and big-picture goals, he almost never volunteers that what he really wants out of life is more equity derivatives. You kind of have to guide him there. Private markets are the new public markets. Ehh, not quite. Part of the appeal of staying private, even if you are a multibillion-dollar company, is that you can keep a lot more control over how your stock trades. You can require your shareholders to ask your permission to sell stock, and deny permission for any trades you don't like. This way, you can keep out pesky activists, freaky high-frequency traders and snooping competitors. Also I guess you can front-run trades if you want? That's from this story about a dispute between Palantir Technologies, the Spy Unicorn, and KT4 Partners, an investor in Palantir. There's a flurry of other claims not relevant to us here, but even if you assume that KT4's allegations are true, they seem sort of shady but ... allowed? The point of giving the company the right to approve stock transactions is that it can refuse, and it can refuse for its own interests. If it needs money, that's an interest! (Blocking one shareholder's sale to favor another, or to favor a broker, seems less justifiable.) If you don't want the company to jump in front of your trades, maybe you should try investing in public companies. Robert Mercer. The problem with amassing vast dynastic wealth by successfully running a multibillion-dollar hedge fund for many years is that it imbues you with an undeserved sense of omnicompetence. ""If I can outperform the market year after year,"" you think, ""then I can do nuclear physics, or solve global warming, or fly."" This isn't much of a problem for you! You still have your money, and your friends still love you, because of the money. But for the people in your orbit it can be annoying, and if you're rich and ambitious enough your orbit can get quite large. Here's a Jane Mayer profile of Robert Mercer, the co-chief executive officer of Renaissance Technologies, who is a major backer of Donald Trump and Breitbart News, and who seems to have taken the confidence he gets from investing in markets and extended it into other domains: Ah. On the other hand, great success leads to high standards, and Mercer has troubles of his own: My favorite bit of the story might be that Mercer's investment in Breitbart News ""was made through Gravitas Maximus, L.L.C.,"" a name that definitely conveys maximum gravitas. Bill Ackman. The problem with amassing vast dynastic wealth by successfully running a multibillion-dollar hedge fund for many years is that it imbues you with an undeserved sense of omnicompetence. Even just in the markets, sometimes. I mean really outperforming the market for a long time is good evidence that you'll keep outperforming the market, but sometimes it goes wrong, and when it does overconfidence is not a virtue. This isn't much of a problem for you! You still have your money. But it can be rough on your investors. Here's a Gretchen Morgenson and Geraldine Fabrikant story about Bill Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc.: Tom Hayes. Here's an excerpt from David Enrich's book ""The Spider Network,"" about Tom Hayes, the mildly autistic British trader convicted of masterminding Libor manipulation. Hayes's relationships with his co-workers, including his mentee Mirhat Alykulov, make for tough reading: The poor dope. Alykulov later recorded calls with Hayes for the Justice Department.  Meanwhile, here's the start of a review of ""The Spider Network"": Here's another: These people all seem to assume that interest rates are boring. Is that a thing? What could be more interesting than interest rates? It's right in the name! There seems to be an expectation that books about finance, if they're going to be interesting, should take it easy on the finance. People who buy a book about the Libor scandal, this thinking goes, are really interested in who threw a shepherd's pie at whom, and would prefer to skip all the stuff about Libor. I hope that is not true. People are worried about unicorns. Here's a story about Bill Gurley, the venture capitalist, Uber backer and Silicon Valley contrarian: I love the idea of a businessman who will risk everything by saying to businesses: Hey, what if you made some money? It's such an unorthodox business philosophy! Venture capitalists were burnt at the stake in the Middle Ages for even whispering similar heresies. But in the modern Enchanted Forest you can find a few brave rebels -- like Gurley, who ""went against conventional wisdom even before he became an investor"" -- who are willing to speak out boldly, whatever the consequences, and say: ""I think businesses should be profitable."" Meanwhile, you never want to say ""We want to thank Jeff for his six months at the company and wish him all the best."" Jeff is Jeff Jones, the president of Uber Technologies Inc., who is leaving because -- in his words -- ""the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber, and I can no longer continue as president of the ride sharing business."" Ouch! We have talked before about the difficulty of bringing in an outsider to fix Uber's culture. (Jones was hired from Target Corp. to fix Uber's marketing, not its culture, but at Uber ""was viewed by many as the so-called adult in the room."") The problem is that the culture-fixer is not going to be a cultural fit, and then is going to quit in a huff in six months. And elsewhere in the post-ownership car economy: ""GM Tries a Subscription Plan for Cadillacs—a Netflix for Cars at $1,500 a Month."" People are worried about stock buybacks. I think that ""people are worried about debt-financed special dividends at private-equity-backed companies"" is an important special case of ""people are worried about stock buybacks,"" though I realize that the dividends aren't technically buybacks. Anyway people are worried about debt-financed special dividends at private-equity-backed companies: The usual complaint with buybacks is that that money could instead be used to fund research, innovation, expansion. That complaint is perhaps less compelling in the case of debt-financed dividends at companies like Payless Inc. Payless's private-equity owners probably did have more compelling places to put their money than in a shoe retailer. ""Hastening the demise of companies that are already troubled"" is called capitalism. I guess the problem here is that it wasn't so much the private-equity owners' money, as it was the creditors' money, but whose fault is that?  Things happen.

2017-03-13T05:06:17.431Z,Bitcoin Miners Signal Revolt Amid Sluggish Blockchain,"Yuji Nakamura
         & Lulu Yilun Chen
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-13/bitcoin-miners-signal-revolt-in-push-to-fix-sluggish-blockchain,"You may not know it by looking at bitcoin’s recent price surge, but the infrastructure underpinning the world’s most popular virtual currency is teetering. While speculators continue to push the value of the digital money to record highs against the U.S. dollar, the system that verifies bitcoin transactions -- known as the blockchain -- is more backlogged than at any point in the currency’s eight-year history. The number of transactions awaiting verification is up more than fivefold from a year ago, and the jam is forcing users to pay increasingly high fees to speed up confirmations, which in some cases is making bitcoin more expensive to use than Visa Inc. or PayPal Holdings Inc. Now, after more than two years of bitter infighting among the global bitcoin community about how to fix the problem, some of its most influential members are giving up on reaching consensus. Instead, they’ve begun backing a controversial solution known as Bitcoin Unlimited. If the gamble pays off, it could ease congestion and may help bring the community back together. If it fails, the digital currency could face a hard fork into separate variants, effectively splitting bitcoin into two currencies. “We will switch our entire pool to Bitcoin Unlimited,” Wu Jihan, founder of the world’s largest mining organization Antpool, said in an interview on Mar. 10. His group accounts for 15 percent of blockchain activity and is hugely influential in the community. “We can’t tell how the hard fork will play out. We will only know by the time we get there.” Wu is joining Roger Ver, an early evangelist who amassed a fortune and got to be known as Bitcoin Jesus. He opened his own mining collective to the public last week. Relying on his high profile in the community and an aggressive pricing scheme, Ver said he’s already attracted about 3 percent of global miners and convinced them to back Unlimited. “We need to get to 60 or 70 percent of miners on board to activate Bitcoin Unlimited,” Ver said in an interview at his office in Tokyo on Mar. 9. “Combined with others, I’d say we’re already close to halfway to our goal at this point.” Bitcoin Unlimited is essentially a software upgrade to the blockchain. Years ago, bitcoin’s early developers imposed a cap on the amount of data it could process. While that slowed down the network, it was seen as a necessary safety measure against potential attackers who could overload the system. Now, Unlimited supporters say the blockchain is robust enough that it doesn’t need any limit at all. While most agree the blockchain is stronger, critics such as Peter Todd, a key coding contributor to bitcoin, say that removing the data cap is a risky move which will leave bitcoin vulnerable to governments and global banks. Without a limit, large organizations would use their resources to out-muscle smaller miners and effectively take control of the blockchain and bitcoin itself. “Bitcoin Unlimited is simply irredeemably broken,” Todd said in an interview on Mar. 11. “Large miners have every reason to vote the size up to push their competition out of business.” Todd contends that a better approach to easing the congestion is to make the blockchain more efficient. Last fall, the group released their own solution, called SegWit, which uses a different method to verify transactions. Todd says adoption has been slow due to resistance from Unlimited supporters. Ver said the lack of support is evidence that SegWit doesn’t address the actual problem: “Say you haven’t had any water to drink for a day and a half, and you also need a haircut. Do you drink some water or go to the barber shop? SegWit is like going to the barber shop.” Wu added that miners like him have refused to adopt SegWit because he doesn’t see his economic interests aligning with what is proposed by the technology. While the rift over bitcoin’s future has gone on for more than two years, Todd’s group have mostly held the upper hand and received support from the majority of miners who prefer to wait for a consensus-based solution instead of rocking the boat. That’s helped pave the way for speculators to bid the digital currency higher, to total market value of about $20 billion. But with Wu and Ver last week striking out in support of Unlimited, the question now is whether other major miners will follow suit. Ver says he plans to step up lobbying efforts, especially in China which is home to the majority of bitcoin mining. Further adoption of Unlimited won’t necessarily lead to a hard fork, though the likelihoods could increase if it gains more traction. What happens after that is unclear, but a precedent exists in ethereum, the world’s second-most popular digital currency. Last year, a disagreement caused one side of the ethereum community to back one version of the software, and the other side to adopt another version. That resulted in ethereum being divided in to two different currencies, each with its own individual price. Both versions tumbled in the months after the split. Samson Mow, former chief operating officer at exchange BTCC, said even in the event of a hard fork, it would be up to the market to decide which version would hold the upper hand and that many wouldn’t deem the new currency as bitcoin. ""Bitcoin Unlimited is not bitcoin because it’s rules are different,"" said Mow. ""If BU splintered, it would create an altcoin and there are hundreds of altcoins. Those altcoins have little value."" Ver says it’s worth taking the risk because inaction will only worsen the crippling backlog: “If bitcoin is more expensive or slower than traditional financial systems, people aren’t going to use it.”"
2017-03-13T13:34:05.035Z,"Spoofing, Cross-Selling and Bitcoin ETFs","Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-13/spoofing-cross-selling-and-bitcoin-etfs,"Layering. Here's how layering, or spoofing, works: That's from the Securities and Exchange Commission's complaint in its case against Avalon FA Ltd., a Ukrainian trading firm that allegedly did a lot of layering. (The description is Avalon's, not the SEC's.) Avalon allegedly acted as an intermediary between ""trade groups"" (which actually did the layering) and a U.S. broker, and monitored the trade groups' activities to see if they were layering. Layering is illegal -- it's market manipulation -- but Avalon wasn't monitoring the trade groups to stop them from layering. It just wanted to make sure it got its cut: ""Layering is VERY expensive now, and we pay very big legal bills to protect this,"" wrote Avalon owner Nathan Fayyer in another email. ""A lot of firms don't have this ability and kick traders out. We do.""  That's cute. But let's talk about the layering strategy. We have discussed the essential dumbness of spoofing before. The highest bid for stock X is $90.09; the lowest offer is $90.14. Avalon's traders bid higher than the best bid in the market -- $90.10, then $90.11, then $90.12, then $90.13 -- assuming that no one will want to sell them X at those prices. Other traders, seeing that Avalon is willing to pay more than anyone else, don't think ""oh hey I should sell at the price they're bidding."" Instead, they say ""oh hey, if those guys are willing to pay more, then I should be willing to pay even more."" So they start bidding $90.14, and $90.15, and so on up to $90.20, at which point Avalon sells to them at $90.20 and the whole process goes into reverse.  That is not how economic activity normally works. If I have stuff to sell, and someone else wants to pay more than the prevailing price for it, then I should happily sell it and be on my way. I shouldn't say ""wait, if this guy will pay so much for my stuff, I should instead be spending even more to buy more stuff."" It doesn't make sense. That doesn't mean that it didn't work -- ""Avalon's layering yielded profits of more than $21 million,"" says the SEC, over almost six years -- just that it shouldn't work.  There's another strategy described in the SEC complaint, which the SEC calls ""cross-market manipulation."" The way this allegedly worked is that Avalon would buy some shares of stock X, which would push the stock price up. This would make put options on X less expensive. Avalon would then buy the put options. Then it would sell the shares it had bought, pushing the stock price down and making the put options more expensive. Then it would sell the puts. It would lose money on the stock, but make even more money on the options. This shouldn't work either. Simplifying: If buying stock pushes up the price of the stock, then buying more puts should push up the price of the puts even more. There is no systematic reason to expect the market to overreact to your stock buying, but under-react to your put buying. There shouldn't be a free lunch. But, according to the SEC, it worked, and I have no real reason to doubt them except a lingering disappointed efficient-markets fundamentalism. That is what offends me about cases like this. It shouldn't be this easy. The first line of defense against market manipulation isn't the SEC, or the exchange operators. The first line of defense against market manipulation is the market. You can manipulate the price of a stock (or related options) by buying the stock, but just moving the price doesn't help you: You have to sell the stock (or related options) to realize the benefit. If your buying pushes up the price, your selling should push it down, and after frictions and transaction costs you should lose money. There shouldn't be a perpetual-motion machine in the markets, a way to predictably and repeatedly make money without engaging in any economic activity. But that's what the SEC alleges here. It's upsetting. If the SEC is right, these guys didn't just violate the U.S. securities laws; they violated the laws of economics.  Cross-selling. Apparently Toronto-Dominion Bank is cooking up its own version of the Wells Fargo & Co. cross-selling scandal: And: TD disputes these characterizations: ""While we have sales goals to help manage our business, we know that we will only succeed by doing the right thing for our customers."" When you go to a used car lot, or call the toll-free number in an infomercial, you have pretty clear expectations: Someone is going to try to sell you something. You prepare yourself mentally; you're on your guard against being suckered. A basic problem in the financial services industry is that it often involves selling things to people who don't think they're being sold things. The ""fiduciary rule"" fight is essentially about that: You go to a financial adviser for advice, and then you're surprised to find out that he's actually selling you high-fee mutual funds that pay him sales commissions. Similarly at TD Bank, ""when a customer keys in a PIN at the teller counter, a gold star lights up on the teller's computer screen, indicating that 'Advice Opportunities Exist.'"" (""Advice"" here, as in much of finance, means ""sales."") You just went to the teller to withdraw some money or get a cashier's check or whatever, and now the helpful friendly person behind the counter is suggesting overdraft protection. You're not mentally prepared to resist. (""TD employees say elderly customers are a common target because they've grown to trust their tellers over the years."") Having tough sales targets for salespeople -- the essential sin at Wells Fargo, and apparently at TD Bank -- is normal. The problem comes when you call your salespeople ""tellers,"" and your customers don't quite realize that they're salespeople. No WinkleTF! Remind me why anyone would need a bitcoin exchange-traded fund? If you're a retail investor and you want to own oil, it is hard. Actual oil is a pain to store; you can't just chuck it in a closet. You can buy oil futures, but eventually those expire, and you have to remember to roll them forward or you'll end up with the actual oil. An oil ETF lets you push one button on your computer and ""own"" a quantity of oil, purely electronically. Similarly, if you're a retail investor and you want to own the Standard & Poor's 500 Index, it is hard. You have to push 500 buttons to buy 500 different stocks, plus you have to get all the proportions right, and what do you do with fractional shares? An S&P 500 ETF lets you push one button on your computer and ""own"" the index. But, look. If you're a retail investor and you want to own bitcoin, then one of the following two things is true: I would like to hope that number 1 is true, but I confess that back when I considered buying some bitcoin, just reading about the procedures made me very tired, and I never ended up doing it. So maybe number 2 is true. But if that's the case -- if normal people just can't buy bitcoins -- then that is not a particularly strong endorsement of its value as a currency. If it's impossible to use, then why would anyone want to use it? In this, it is different from oil, or the S&P 500, whose value does not derive from their transactional usefulness to ordinary people. So if bitcoin is hard to buy, you probably don't want to buy it in ETF form. And if it's easy to buy, you don't need to buy it in ETF form. There's a reason that no one has invented a ""euro ETF"" that just buys euros and chucks them in a vault.  But someone invented a ""bitcoin ETF"" that just buys bitcoins and chucks them in a metaphorical vault, and it was Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, and on Friday the Securities and Exchange Commission disapproved their application to list their ETF due to ""concerns about the potential for fraudulent or manipulative acts and practices"" in the bitcoin market. The SEC's concern is that the major bitcoin markets are unregulated, and there's no one monitoring them for manipulation and abuse, so someone could easily manipulate bitcoin prices in a way that would affect the prices of the bitcoin ETF: This strikes me as a somewhat strange complaint. Most markets for most commodities are ""unregulated,"" in the sense that there's no central authority monitoring trades and setting the rules for how prices are made. There's no central regulator monitoring every time a farmer sells soybeans. There are regulators examining soybean futures transactions, sure, but those are just derivatives of the underlying commodity transactions. Also part of the point of the Winklevoss ETF was to create a regulated market. Here's a statement from Jerry Brito, the executive director of the Coin Center: Once you have the ETF, you have market makers and authorized participants trading it, and arbitraging it against the price of bitcoin. Institutional money gets involved. Then the market makers and institutions have an investment in making sure that the price of bitcoin is right: They demand better exchanges and regulation, they complain about manipulation, etc. Eventually things get better. But I can sympathize with the SEC. The bitcoin ETF probably would help to make the world of bitcoin a bit less scruffy and more stable. But that's not the SEC's job. The SEC's job is to protect investors from being swindled while the market remains scruffy, and it's hard to argue with its conclusion that that's still the case. Great quarter, guys. Jason Zweig writes about a study finding that stock analysts are pretty cordial on earnings calls: That's about one ""great quarter"" every five or so calls, which is ... way less than I would have expected? To be fair, you have the financial crisis in the middle of that period. If your model of sell-side equity research is that it's essentially about helping clients get access to corporate managers, then this makes total sense. Why not be polite? ""Because groveling to management seems to help analysts secure what’s called 'corporate access,'"" writes Zweig, ""it’s no wonder that many analysts come across as bootlicking sycophants."" The interesting point is that Securities and Exchange Commission rules require analysts to mean what they say, when they write research reports: If you think clients should sell a stock, you can't call it a Buy, even if doing so will help you get clients meetings with the company's managers. But no rule that I'm aware of requires you to mean what you say in your casual pre-question buttering-up of management. You can go ahead and say ""great quarter, guys,"" even if you think the quarter was mediocre, or bad. It's free flattery, whereas flattering executives in your research report itself is dangerous. Should index funds be illegal? No, say law professors Edward Rock and Daniel Rubinfeld: Still, they are open to the idea that the law should respond to the rise in common ownership of multiple firms by the same institutional investors, and they recommend an antitrust ""'safe harbor' for investors who hold 15% or less, who do not have board representation, and who engage in no more than 'normal' corporate governance activities."" Figuring out what are ""normal corporate governance activities,"" and deciding whether they are or aren't an antitrust problem, seems like a useful project for antitrust law. The future of work. We talked on Friday about JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s plans for roving never-ending performance reviews, and I joked that ""pretty soon, the computers will do all of the economic activity, and we'll just sit around evaluating each other."" But a Twitter conversation reminded me that that closely tracks this hypothesis about a post-scarcity future from Manu Saadia: Oh right -- ""in the series."" He's discussing his book about the economics of ""Star Trek,"" but it might as well be JPMorgan or Bridgewater Associates. In a sense, a lot of the financial industry has already achieved post-scarcity economics. Nobody works at Bridgewater for decades because they need the money. Their motivation has to come from somewhere else. The feeling of being constantly evaluated might work. People are worried about unicorns. One thing that I sometimes think about Uber Technologies Inc. is: How hard can it be to make a ride-hailing app? It is not all that capital-intensive. The algorithm (find car near person, send car to person) seems fairly straightforward. How deep is Uber's moat, if it is just a matching engine? That worry is presumably what drives Uber's push into self-driving cars. But maybe it's wrong: Yeah, you really have to get SXSW right, if you are going to be a ride-hailing startup. Otherwise you are embarrassing yourself in front of the entire herd of unicorns. Elsewhere: ""Stationary Bike Startup Peloton Seeks Unicorn Valuation.""  Things happen.

2017-03-16T00:59:36.519Z,Here’s How Russian Agents Hacked 500 Million Yahoo Users,"Dune Lawrence
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-16/here-s-how-russian-agents-hacked-500-million-yahoo-users,"It was June 2013, and U.S. law enforcement thought they were finally getting their hands on a slippery target: Russian hacker Alexsey Belan, indicted in Nevada and California for computer intrusions at three U.S. e-commerce companies, had been arrested in Europe. Instead, Belan escaped to Russia, where the U.S. charges didn’t hamper his job prospects. Rather than handing Belan over to the U.S., Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) enlisted the man to help the agency hack into American Internet companies, including Yahoo! Inc. The conspiracy, laid out in an indictment in Federal Court in San Francisco, reveals the internal workings of Russia’s state cyber-spying regime, implicated in alleged attempts to influence the U.S. election last year. Increasingly, it’s a system that capitalizes on a vast and talented pool of Russian-speaking cyber criminals, blurring the lines between profit and intelligence gathering. ""We believe that their technical capabilities are not where they’re purported to be and they’re using criminal hackers,"" said Jack Bennett, the San Francisco Division Special Agent in Charge of the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s San Francisco office. He spoke at a press conference on Wednesday. Besides Belan, the U.S. indicted two FSB officials, Dmitry Dokuchaev and Igor Sushchin, and a second hacker, Karim Baratov, a Kazakh living in Canada. It’s a first for the U.S., which has never before indicted anyone from the FSB for cyber-crimes, said Edward McAndrew, a former federal cybercrime prosecutor and now co-chair of the privacy and data security group at the law firm Ballard Spahr LLP. ""It obviously comes at a very intense time in our relationship with Russia and its cyber activities,"" he said. ""It also provides the public with fresh insight into the way that nation-state actors are enlisting cyber criminals of all types, from syndicates to lone wolves, to engage in sophisticated cyber campaigns."" The indictment offers a lot of new information about the hack into Yahoo in 2014 that affected some half a billion accounts. Yahoo disclosed the breach last year, and pointed the finger at a ""state-sponsored actor."" The intrusion, along with a second, earlier hack that exposed even more accounts, has complicated Yahoo’s planned acquisition by Verizon Communications Inc. Yahoo shares rose less than 1 percent to $46.44 at 9:38 a.m. in New York on Thursday.  ""The indictment unequivocally shows the attacks on Yahoo were state-sponsored,"" Chris Madsen, an assistant general counsel for security and law enforcement at Yahoo, said in a statement. ""We’re committed to keeping our users and our platforms secure and will continue to engage with law enforcement to combat cybercrime."" Belan, also known as ""Magg,"" was born in Latvia but holds a Russian passport, according to the FBI. He has a fondness for hair dye, based on an FBI wanted poster that features three snapshots of the baby-faced hacker with three different-colored manes. The FSB recruited Belan in part by providing him with information that helped him avoid detection by law enforcement, according to the indictment. He quickly repaid his handlers with access to Yahoo’s computer network; by early 2014 he’d gotten them inside Yahoo’s system, and from there into the internal control center for Yahoo email accounts, the tool the company used to administer changes to accounts, like new passwords. That allowed them to see things like recovery email accounts, indicating specific companies and institutions of interest to the FSB, which helped them zero in on which of the stolen accounts might be of most use. In November or December of that year, according to the indictment, he copied and exported a backup of Yahoo’s User Database. The hackers then used the database to forge credentials, tricking Yahoo servers into recognizing them as an account holder who had essentially stayed logged in. The maneuver, appetizingly called ""cookie minting,"" allowed them to read the contents of some 6,500 Yahoo accounts without even needing a password or username. Proving yet again how difficult intrusions can be to detect, the hack unrolled through 2015 to the end of 2016. Many of the targets were Russian: journalists, employees of a Russian cybersecurity company, and officials, even someone described as a physical training expert working in the Ministry of Sports. (The Justice Department did not release names of victims, only general descriptions.) They also included 14 employees of a Swiss bitcoin banking firm, a Nevada gaming official, a senior officer of a major U.S. airline, a Shanghai-based managing director of a U.S. private equity firm, and the chief technology officer of a French transportation company. The hackers got personal once they’d focused on a particular target, identifying spouses and children and sending malware-laden emails to gain even more information about their victims. Baratov, the second hacker, who lives in Hamilton, a city near Toronto, was apparently the phishing expert -- crafting emails that lured victims into giving up sensitive information. Baratov was paid to gain access to 80 email accounts, including 50 Google accounts, according to the indictment. Belan, meanwhile, found opportunities to make some money on the side. While he gave the FSB access to Yahoo’s networks, he also used Yahoo servers for his own gain, manipulating search results for erectile dysfunction medication to send people to the website of one particular online pharmacy. That pharmacy paid Belan to drive traffic to the site, according to the indictment. As much as the indictment reveals about the secretive hack, the allegations leave many unanswered questions: how the alleged FSB-led breach relates to the earlier, even bigger intrusion, in 2013, that affected more than a billion accounts; how Belan and co-conspirators got into Yahoo’s network to begin with; and how the FSB may have used the information they obtained. Perhaps the closest precedent for today’s indictment is the 2014 case against five Chinese military hackers for spying against U.S. companies, including U.S. Steel and Alcoa. Hailed as a breakthrough at the time, the five remain beyond the reach of U.S. prosecution. This case shows more promise for real courtroom action; one of the suspects has already been apprehended. Baratov appeared in a Canadian court on Wednesday, telling the judge, in a soft voice, that he planned to apply for bail but needed to find legal counsel first. He was taken out by court officers and will be in police custody until his next appearance, a bail hearing scheduled for March 17. A Facebook profile belonging to a Karim Baratov showed the same young man pictured in the indictment. The profile features pictures of him standing in front of a large suburban home with several luxury cars including an Aston Martin and Mercedes. Both cars’ license plates match those mentioned in the indictment as property that is subject to forfeiture. ""We’ve reached the point that name and shame indictments are no longer sufficient, we really need to follow through with successful convictions,"" said McAndrew. ""It’s important for private companies to see that more will come from their cooperation in these investigations than merely naming individuals in an indictment who will never actually see the inside of a courtroom. We need to put people in jail."" Belan remains at large in Russia. So does Sushchin. Dokuchaev, who worked in the FSB’s information-security division, was detained in December by Russian law enforcement, on suspicion of having links to U.S. intelligence agencies, and may face as many as 20 years in prison if convicted on treason charges, Ivan Pavlov, a lawyer involved in case, said at the time. Pavlov declined to comment on Wednesday’s indictments. Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov, asked about the possibility of cooperation on the Yahoo case, told Bloomberg that Russia is interested in cooperating with U.S. against cyber threats. The FSB did not respond to a request for comment. The FBI’s Bennett said that though the U.S. doesn’t have an extradition agreement with Russia, he was confident the three suspects would not remain at large. ""These guys will travel one day somewhere. There are countries that have extradition treaties with the United States and we will take advantage of that,"" he said. ""The world is a small place."" — With assistance by Joel Rosenblatt, Gerrit De Vynck, and Stepan Kravchenko"
2017-03-10T21:14:44.117Z,Bitcoin Plummets 18% as SEC Rejects Winklevoss ETF Proposal,"Olga Kharif
         & Benjamin Bain
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-10/sec-rejects-bitcoin-etf-setting-digital-currency-up-for-big-drop,"Bitcoin’s price plummeted after U.S. regulators rejected a proposal by the Winklevoss twins for a publicly traded fund based on the digital currency, dashing hopes that a government-approved investment vehicle would lead to wider interest in virtual money. The Securities and Exchange Commission refused to grant an exemption that would have let the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust trade on the Bats BZX Exchange, according to a filing posted Friday on the regulator’s website. The decision ended a months-long rally that pushed the virtual money’s value higher than gold. Bitcoin fell as much as 18 percent against the dollar to $978.76 after the decision, the lowest intraday price in a month. Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss, the brothers famed for their dispute with Mark Zuckerberg over the origins of Facebook, vowed to continue working with the SEC to make their bitcoin vision a reality. They have been engaging with regulators and tweaking their proposal for years. Friday’s decision doesn’t close the door on a possible future exchange-traded fund based on bitcoin, but it makes the path more complicated. The SEC rejected the application because the Bats exchange would be unable to enter into necessary surveillance-sharing agreements given that “significant markets for bitcoin are unregulated,” according to the filing on the agency’s website. “The Commission does not find the proposed rule change to be consistent with the Exchange Act.” Bitcoin isn’t regulated by any government and has been used by consumers worldwide to shelter assets from inflation or political upheavals in their home countries. Last year, bitcoin outperformed all major foreign-exchange trades, stock indexes, and currencies and commodity contracts. “The SEC is the gatekeeper against securities that are not properly market tested and could be a danger to investors,” said Mark T. Williams, master lecturer at Boston University, who focuses on risk management. “It is reassuring that the SEC did their job in properly protecting the market.” After bitcoin’s initial plunge on the news, the currency pared losses to 8.3 percent at 5:11 p.m. in New York on Friday. “We remain optimistic and committed to bringing COIN to market, and look forward to continuing to work with the SEC staff,” Tyler Winklevoss said in a statement. “We began this journey almost four years ago, and are determined to see it through. We agree with the SEC that regulation and oversight are important to the health of any marketplace and the safety of all investors.” Two other bitcoin ETFs under regulatory review -- Bitcoin Investment Trust and SolidX Bitcoin Trust -- filed more recently, in January of 2017 and in mid-2016, respectively. The SEC staff’s wording in the decision could also spell trouble for the others, said Spencer Bogart, head of research at Blockchain Capital.  “The reasons for disapproval appear unrelated to specifics of the Winklevoss filing and therefore this announcement is a negative indicator for the prospects of the other bitcoin ETFs,” he said. Hannah Randall, a spokeswoman for Bats, said the exchange is reviewing the ruling and declined to comment further. The decision by the SEC was made by the Trading and Markets Division staff, according to the filing. Agency staff has so-called delegated authority to effectively approve new ETFs without a vote by commissioners. “The Commission notes that bitcoin is still in the relatively early stages of its development and that, over time, regulated bitcoin-related markets of significant size may develop,” the agency’s staff said in its decision. “Should such markets develop, the Commission could consider whether a bitcoin ETP would, based on the facts and circumstances then presented, be consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act.”"
2017-03-15T13:33:53.896Z,"Consultants, Culture and Speed Bumps","Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-15/consultants-culture-and-speed-bumps,"Investment consultants. If you believe that investing skill exists and can be identified in advance, then you will want to hire skilled professionals to manage your money. This creates lucrative employment for the skilled professionals, but also for a lot of other people. You don't just need skilled managers to manage the money; you also need skilled consultants to find the managers, and skilled employees to hire the consultants and the managers. Business schools are needed to train the managers. A whole economic ecosystem exists, predicated on the notion that investing skill is a real thing that can be identified and measured. This is no different from any other business, of course. If everyone thinks that dentistry is a science, there'll be employment opportunities for dentists, and dental practice managers, and dental insurers, and dental schools, and so forth. But unlike with dentistry, it is perfectly respectable, these days, to believe that investing skill is worthless or imaginary, and that you should just index. And if you believe that, you can have one guy run a $35 billion pension by just putting it into index funds and hanging up when consultants call. Those are different approaches! Here's a story about how Cambridge Associates, the investment consultant that is ""one of the best-known purveyors of advice to endowments, foundations and the wealthy,"" laid off almost 50 people, as ""the consulting model has faced pressure from increased competition that has driven down fees and from investors’ growing embrace of low-cost, passive index products."" (Counterintuitively, ""Cambridge Chief Executive David Druley on an internal call last week about the layoffs said Cambridge was increasingly transitioning from a consulting to an investment firm."") Elsewhere: ""Asset Manager Deal Wave Has Just Begun."" Bank culture. Here is David Zaring on the regulatory concern with ""culture in financial services"": I think there are two things going on here. One is a widespread assumption that finance is distinctively unethical. If you think that ""the business model of Wall Street is fraud,"" that banks are criminal syndicates, but also that we need to have banks, then, sure, you will want cultural changes. This is obviously populist: Most people are not that interested in the nuances of capital regulation, so telling them that you're going to raise capital requirements from 8 to 12 percent and eliminate the ability to rely on internal models for risk-weighting will leave them cold. But making bankers swear an oath not to do fraud any more -- as the Netherlands literally does -- is easy to explain and appreciate.  But the other thing going on here is what Zaring identifies, which is that a lot of people are just mistaken about what Wall Street does. They think that Wall Street is in the advisory business -- for mergers or retirement accounts -- and therefore should be held to the same sort of professional fiduciary standards that we have for doctors and lawyers, who have to put their clients' interests first. But this is not a completely accurate description of Wall Street: You saw this after the financial crisis, when congresspeople asked bankers if they had a fiduciary business to the customers who bought their bonds. Of course not! You can't have a fiduciary duty to your trading counterparty. You have a duty not to lie to him, sure. But you are in obvious opposition to him on a bond trade: You are selling him the bond because he thinks it's worth more than you do, and every extra dollar that he pays goes directly to you. You don't expect a used car salesman to sell you the used car that best suits your needs, at the fairest possible price. You understand that he's trying to sell you the car he has, at the highest price he can get. To be fair, this misunderstanding is partly Wall Street's own fault: If you hire a bunch of salespeople and call them ""financial advisers"" (or ""tellers""), people might get the mistaken impression that they're fiduciary advisers. Speed bumps. Investors' Exchange LLC runs a stock exchange with a 350-microsecond ""speed bump"" to try to thwart some high-frequency trading strategies. When IEX filed to become a public stock exchange, NYSE Group Inc. screamed bloody murder, objecting to the Securities and Exchange Commission that IEX's speed bump would be bad for market integrity and would lead other exchanges to ""similarly add an intentional delay,"" which ""would be a step backwards in the development of the national market system."" The SEC approved IEX anyway. And so NYSE shrugged and proposed its own speed bump, in its NYSE MKT exchange (which it plans to rename ""NYSE American""). I guess it changed its mind? Back in 2015, NYSE said that speed bumps are Bad, and IEX said that they are Good. Since then, IEX's view has prevailed, and NYSE has had a change of heart and decided that speed bumps are Good, or Good Enough anyway. And then IEX filed a comment letter on NYSE's speed bump. What do you think it said? Hahaha of course IEX opposed NYSE's speed bump: I mean, I sympathize with IEX's calling out NYSE's cynicism. But IEX looks a little cynical itself, opposing NYSE's proposal to add a speed bump. (If speed bumps are good, why wouldn't you want more of them? If IEX can have a speed bump, why can't NYSE?) One thing that I like to think about equity market structure is that it is about plausible balancing of competing economic interests, and morality doesn't enter into it. A bunch of self-interested economic actors try to figure out how to most profitably serve a client base, and then they snipe at each other in SEC comment letters in the language of deep moral outrage. Elsewhere: ""Chicago Wants to Be a Hub for China Stock Trading."" Insider trading. Nima Hedayati: not a Money Stuff reader. This violates at least the first two laws of insider trading: Don't insider trade, and if you do insider trade, don't do it by buying short-dated out-of-the-money call options. I would now like to promulgate a Third Law of Insider Trading, which is: If you do insider trade, don't do it in your mother's (father's, aunt's, etc.) account. None of these laws of insider trading are, of course, laws, or legal advice. But insider trading with your mom's money is bad form. Valeant. Yesterday I wrote about the end of Pershing Square Capital Management's investment in Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc. After I wrote that, Pershing Square filed with the SEC about its sale; here are its Schedule 13D amendment, its trading annex, and its Form 4. The numbers are pretty close to my estimates. (Pershing Square sold its stock for $11, but managed to get out of its option combos at $47.35 instead of $49.) A couple of people pointed out, though, that Pershing Square is not quite done with Valeant: There is still a class-action lawsuit against Pershing Square and Valeant for alleged insider trading in their joint effort to take over Allergan, which could end up leading to damages. I have been pretty sympathetic to Pershing Square's and Valeant's position in that lawsuit -- I think that trading on secret knowledge of your own intentions is obviously not insider trading -- but it's a tough question and they might lose, in which case Pershing Square's Valeant return could be even more negative.  Blockchain blockchain blockchain blockchain. Delaware, the state where most big U.S. companies are incorporated, is working on changes to its corporate law to allow companies to keep their shareholder records on the blockchain. The amendments are eye-wateringly boring: I guess every great revolution has to define its terms. Meanwhile Dubai is at the buzzwords stage, which I guess comes before the legal-definitions stage? And here is a story about putting frequent-flyer miles on the blockchain that I found puzzling: But ... why ... what? If you put all the loyalty programs on one platform, so that anyone can use any rental-car company's points at any hotel, then how do they ... promote ... loyalty? Why not just use money? (""Thanks for flying with Delta. Here's ten bucks."") I guess the point is you'd have different loyalty consortia -- ""Ultimately, we expect to see the development of four to six blockchain-based loyalty networks, each anchored by a major airline, a major hotel chain, or a group of smaller travel companies"" -- but, as I find myself saying all the time, if you are building a closed system with a trusted central intermediary, the trusted central intermediary could just keep a list. Of frequent-flyer miles. Like it does now. Elsewhere, ""Bitcoin Price Recovers as True Believers Keep the Faith."" And: ""Divisive ‘Bitcoin Unlimited’ Solution Crashes After Bug Discovered."" And a reader pointed out an issue with the story, which we discussed yesterday, about Brooklyn's artisanal solar-power blockchain: A proof-of-work blockchain, like the one used for bitcoin, might use more power than the solar panels can produce. Happy Fed Day! They're gonna raise rates. The drama comes later: ""Fed’s Challenge, After Raising Rates, May Be Existential,"" writes Eduardo Porter, and really isn't that true of all of us? Elsewhere, the debt-ceiling nonsense is percolating again. Aww, they're playing M&A! Here is a heartwarming story about how law students who want to be corporate lawyers have long been jealous of competitive moot court opportunities for future litigators, but now they have a dealmaking competition of their own. It's the ""Transactional LawMeet, an annual deal negotiating face-off,"" and it's adorable. Also this quote should be engraved over the doors of every law school in America: Yep, that's what happens! People are worried about unicorns. Canada Goose Holdings, the goosicorn -- half goose, half unicorn (narwhal?) -- ""is set to price its initial public offering Wednesday afternoon, a person familiar with the offering said, just as the northeastern U.S. digs itself out of a late-winter snowstorm."" That is fortuitous timing, if your model of public stock markets is that they can pay attention only to the immediate present. ""It is currently snowing,"" says the stock market, ""and therefore it will always be snowing, so demand for expensive snow jackets will always be high."" This is a popular model, and difficult to argue with, though what does it say about money-losing Snap Inc.'s successful IPO?  Also ""Buzz Aldrin: Cycling Pathways to Mars"" is a virtual reality experience sponsored by Soylent that premiered at South By Southwest, which feels like something I should mention here and never think about again. Food Stuff. A year ago, we spent a lot of time in this space discussing the latest trend in modern food-delivery systems, which was: the bowl. ""Even if I had the option to eat off a plate, I would eat out of a bowl,"" is what all the ""hot, skinny people"" were saying. ""A bowl is much more flexible and open to interpretation compared to a plate."" These are real quotes. But the bowl is so 2016, and the hot new food-delivery system for spring 2017 is the edible drone, ""parts of whose frame could be made of anything from honeycomb to compressed vegetables."" I laughed at that paragraph until I choked, though Twitter eventually informed me that that price tag is probably per drone, not per person. (Here is a factsheet.) Obviously this technology should be combined with burrito delivery drones. You can conveniently order dinner for yourself and 50 of your friends: You get a burrito, and they all get to gnaw on an airplane made of compressed vegetable matter.

2017-03-14T13:33:36.471Z,Research Prices and Artisanal Energy,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-14/research-prices-and-artisanal-energy,"Research monetization. Macquarie Group Ltd., like a lot of banks, is experimenting with research unbundling: Fine, yes, that is the probable future of research. But this troubled me: As a former lawyer, I will say that many lawyers view hourly billing as the original sin of the legal business. Banks are smart: If you charge clients based on the size of their transaction, rather than the amount of time you put into it, you can both charge them more and make them feel better about paying you. Your bill is psychologically linked to value (""look at this big deal we did for you!"") rather than drudgery (""look at how long we spent drafting this contract you didn't read!""). And the incentives are better: You get paid for creating a lot of value quickly, rather than for creating a lot of work slowly.  Research has always been more ethereal than either. Analysts charge neither for their time nor for their value; they charge nothing, in exchange for an expectation that the clients will send trading business to their bank. I've called that ""hardly a business at all,"" and it is, but still. Sometimes a call will be worth $10,000 to a client, or much more, and if you charge $500 for it you're going to feel a bit silly. The old system -- where analysts gave their calls away for free, but gave the $10,000-value calls to the clients who'd do at least $1 million of commission business -- probably handled that issue better than flat hourly billing will. (To be fair, Macquarie Dimension is aimed at ""mid-tier clients"" who wouldn't be getting the $10,000 calls anyway.) Also: a la carte corporate access? Oversimplifying, here's the current U.S. system: There is a flow of value there. The company has something the investor wants: management's time and insights. The bank obtains that valuable thing in exchange for favorable research coverage. The bank then gives the valuable thing to the investor in exchange for trading business. There are exchanges at each stage. But when I describe it like this it sounds laughably cynical, and indeed this description of what companies are giving and getting is too cynical. The system works because the exchanges are implicit and intangible. Analysts don't say to companies, ""we will give you favorable research coverage if you will meet with our clients."" (Sometimes companies do say that they won't meet with clients of banks who give unfavorable coverage, though.) And they don't say to investors, ""we will bring you to a meeting with this company if you pay us a million dollars."" An economy exists, but it is a gift economy, one in which it is crass to ascribe precise dollar values or to demand quid pro quos too explicitly. But if you abandon that gift economy, you end up in a weird place. If an analyst brings an investor to meet with a company manager, and then sends the investor a bill for the meeting -- shouldn't the company get a cut? If banks are directly, explicitly selling access to corporate managers, why shouldn't the companies sell that access themselves? And if there is a direct, explicit price placed on corporate access, and big investors pay that price, what does that tell you about securities regulations that prohibit ""selective disclosure by issuers of material nonpublic information""? Artisanal energy trading. This story about the ""Brooklyn Microgrid,"" a local solar-energy trading collective, has all the things: twee Brooklyn small-batch-ness, solar power, modern ""smart grid"" energy, ""peer-to-peer"" trading, the blockchain. Most of all, though, it is about whether and how modern computer and financial technologies can replace trust in institutions: If you have bitcoin, you don't need banks for payments. If you have peer-to-peer lending, you don't need them for loans. If you have a ""virtual, peer-to-peer energy trading system built on blockchain,"" you don't need utility companies. I mean, you do! (Personal rooftop solar panels probably aren't supplying all of the microgrid's electricity all of the time. Sometimes it rains in Brooklyn.) But you can talk like you don't. ""It takes a central procurer — in this case, historically, the utility — out of the mix,"" says a former regulator, ""and really sets the market where they’re not buying and selling to the utility but they’re identifying each other’s need and willingness to buy and sell."" I don't know. The bull case for all this peer-to-peer blockchaining is that it recreates the capitalist virtues on a local, tangible scale. You trade energy or loans or bitcoins with your neighbors directly, without the intermediation of all-powerful institutions, and you learn to trust and rely on them. Commerce is stripped of its bureaucratic facelessness and becomes what it once was, a way to build community bonds. You get all the social benefits of a small-business economy -- trust, reputation, local knowledge, customization, warm feelings -- with all the efficiency of modern technology and blockchains. The bear case is that institutions are actually useful, and that trust in institutions -- not just in direct transactions with your neighbors -- is valuable. A bank is not just an annoying rent-seeking middleman between lenders who want to lend and borrowers who want to borrow: By turning the lenders' loans into ""deposits,"" it makes them safer; it turns trust in institutions into economic value. (The banking system, with a central bank and deposit insurance, is what makes deposits safe and allows us to overcome the collective action problem of making risky investments.) A utility company is not just an annoying rent-seeking middleman between people whose roofs are too sunny and people whose roofs aren't sunny enough. It also runs big power plants! The reason I can use more electricity than I generate is not that I can borrow my next-door neighbor's extra electricity; it's that we as a society have enough trust in collective action that we create the corporate structures and government regulations that allow big utility companies to build big power plants. Elsewhere: ""SoFi's Loan Losses Pile Up as Even Wealthy Borrowers Default."" Corporate governance. BlackRock Inc. is going ""to put new pressure on companies to explain themselves on issues including how climate change could affect their business as well as boardroom diversity"": One well-known issue in asset management is the problem of specialization. (Harvard's endowment wrestled with it recently.) You're a big firm and you want to be able to invest in a bunch of different asset classes. So you hire experts in all of them. But then you have a problem, which is that each expert wants to do more of the thing you hired her to do, because that is good for her influence and job security. If you hire someone to be the U.S. tech equities analyst, then gosh darn it she is going to find you some U.S. tech equities. Maybe U.S. tech equities are not a great investment right now, but that's not her concern: Her concern is to make sure that you're buying U.S. tech equities, because if you're not, what are you paying her for?  Similarly, if you hire a 30-person governance team, and you ask them ""what's up with governance?,"" they are not going to reply ""it's fine."" They are going to do governancey things: It's their job, for one thing, and they're the sorts of people who chose governancey jobs, for another. Are they going to do the governancey things that you want, and that are good for your overall investment portfolio? Quite possibly! Larry Fink, Blackrock's chief executive officer, does seem genuinely committed to good governance, environmental and social goals, and ""long-term sustainability."" More generally, though, there seems to be a separation between the notions of ""good governance"" held by portfolio managers (who tend to like stock buybacks and limited takeover protections) and those held by governance teams at large asset managers (who tend to be more interested in environmental and social issues). I wonder if some of the modern consensus about governance comes less from the economic desires of investors and more from the professionalization of the governance teams. Everything is seating charts. We have talked several times around here (and elsewhere) about the importance of seating charts, so I was pleased to see that Square, Inc., the mobile payments startup, is taking them seriously: The job listing is a wondrous thing; the capacity coordinator's duties include: Imagine performing the periodic audits. You'd wander the office with a clipboard, finding people who are in the wrong seats and telling them to move. Then you'd go back to your desk to type up the audit report. ""We achieved 97.3 percent seating-chart compliance this quarter, up 4 percentage points quarter-over-quarter, driven by the new 'It's Your Seat -- Sit In It!' compliance initiative in the Sales department."" And a tech company offers so many opportunities for innovation: I am working on my novel about someone who is hired as the seating coordinator at a tech company and then, through Machiavellian manipulations and keen insight into the psyche of the modern business person, ruthlessly consolidates power, disposes of her rivals, facilitates their departure desk cleanups, and ends up as the CEO.  Elsewhere in office space. Goldman Sachs Group Inc.'s capacity coordinator is re-coordinating capacity: I hope ""shoulder-to-shoulder"" is literal, though it probably isn't. (GSAM's three floors, high up in the headquarters, are each smaller than its new space on the third floor.) I used to work at Goldman, and before we moved into 200 West Street all anyone could think or talk about was whether we'd lose any personal space on the new trading floor. When you spend 14 hours a day at work, and work is a six-and-a-half-foot stretch of indistinguishable desk space, losing six inches of that space can be devastating. I guess there are compensating amenities: I like that modernity, in the form of the cell phone, killed the phone booth, but postmodernity, in the form of the open-plan office, will bring it back. Private markets are the new public markets. Well here is a perfect headline: ""Buyout Firm Buys $800 Million of Assets From Itself."" The firm is Investindustrial, a European buyout firm, and it's raising a new fund to buy assets from its old fund. The problem is that the old fund had a 10-year life, and the firm wants to hold the assets for longer. Fine, yes, that makes sense. There are obvious conflict-of-interest problems -- the more the new fund pays, the higher the old fund's performance fees, for one thing -- but I suppose they are manageable, and ""investors representing 55% of the money in the original fund have returned to the new fund."" But there's something a little strange about perpetual buyout ownership. Investindustrial is rolling over its funds ""as it responds to greater competition for assets from institutions such as sovereign-wealth funds, which don’t have restrictions on how long they can own companies."" Well yes but. Nobody has restrictions on how long they can own companies, except private equity funds. You can just go buy Alphabet Inc. stock and hold it forever. Once, perpetual public ownership was the norm, and buyout funds staged brief interventions to restructure companies and prepare them to be sold again. (""Historically, buyout specialists took pride in their ability to turn around the fortunes of ailing companies and sell them for a big profit within five years."") Now private equity firms aspire to a perpetual horizon, because the difference between public and private markets has eroded. Similarly, venture capital funds used to finance tech startups for a few years before selling them to the public. Now companies stay private longer, and eventually you're going to see a venture capital firm raising money to buy its unicorns from itself. Yes, there's a euro ETF. Yesterday, in talking about whether a bitcoin exchange-traded fund is really necessary, I said ""there's a reason that no one has invented a 'euro ETF' that just buys euros and chucks them in a vault."" Many, many emails later, I am now intimately familiar with FXE, the Guggenheim CurrencyShares Euro Trust. I suppose it's not technically an ETF (it's a grantor trust rather than an investment company), and it doesn't put the euros in a vault (it puts them in a bank account at JPMorgan), but sure, it undermines my point that a euro ETF doesn't exist because it doesn't make sense. It does exist! This will teach me to argue nonexistence from uselessness. (Also I'm sure it's useful!) It has about $264 million in assets; by comparison, one estimate about the bitcoin ETF was ""that at least $300 million would come into any approved ETF in the first week, as a convenient door to bitcoin opens up to investors.""  People are worried about unicorns. ""Uber has produced 18 episodes of a podcast warning drivers about the dangers of joining a union,"" which sounds ... so boring? I guess if you are driving an Uber all day you're going to run out of episodes of ""Odd Lots"" and need something to listen to, but there really is a whole world of podcasts out there. Have you tried Mike Duncan's ""Revolutions""? It may have some relevance to disgruntled Uber drivers. Elsewhere: ""Intel Buys Mobileye in $15.3 Billion Bid to Lead Self-Driving Car Market.""

2017-03-09T12:00:00.005Z,Bitcoin Trust's Silbert to Launch Classic Ether Fund This Month,"Olga Kharif
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-09/bitcoin-trust-s-silbert-to-launch-classic-ether-fund-this-month,"Barry Silbert, whose Bitcoin Investment Trust made it easier for mainstream investors to bet on bitcoin’s value, is looking to create a second trust later this month focused on a different digital currency: classic ether. The new trust will buy up and hold classic ether, which can be a hassle to obtain independently. The new financial vehicle will be structured exactly like the Bitcoin Investment Trust, run privately and available to accredited investors, such as those those with a net worth of more than $1 million or with $200,000 in annual income. It will also have minimum investment requirements, which are yet to be disclosed. Eventually, just like Bitcoin Investment Trust, it may start trading over the counter, Silbert said in an interview. The bitcoin trust, started in 2013, is currently waiting for approval to list on the NYSE Arca market. By increasing demand for classic ether, the trust could boost the price of the digital currency, which is less than a year old. Classic ether, in which Silbert and his Digital Currency Group are investors, currently has a market value of about $116 million, having appreciated 44 percent since July, according to CoinMarketCap.com. Prices for bitcoin and other digital currencies have been surging, partly on a bet that their value will be increased by attempts to make them more widely available for trading. Bitcoin hit a record last week, though it has fallen in the past few days, dropping 6.4 percent Wednesday to $1,165.19. Classic ether is a far less well known currency that bitcoin, which has a market value of $18.7 billion, according to CoinMarketCap.com. It was created after infighting among holders of ether, a separate currency that now has a market value of about $1.48 billion. Classic ether’s development and rules governing the nets; recently, developers announced there will be no more than 230 million classic ether tokens issued -- a decision that makes the digital currency a scarce resource, just like bitcoin. Sponsored by Grayscale Investments, which Silbert founded, the Bitcoin Investment Trust emerged when bitcoin cost around $100, a far cry from its current price. The trust now has about $220 million in assets under management. “I think we’ve demonstrated success,” Silbert said. “And I think we demonstrated our ability to identify an investment opportunity before it attracted a lot of attention and a lot of capital.” Grayscale will publish a thesis for the new trust on Thursday. In the future, Grayscale Investments may introduce other products focused on additional digital currencies, Silbert said. One other digital currency he holds is Zcash, he said. — With assistance by Rob Golum"
2017-03-08T10:00:00.009Z,"Investors Who Missed Bitcoin Rally Go for Dash, Ether, Monero","Olga Kharif
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-08/investors-who-missed-bitcoin-rally-go-for-dash-ether-monero,"With bitcoin on a tear, Mira Kwon decided there’s more money to be made elsewhere. A little over a month ago, the University of Maryland economics graduate began pouring more than $2,000 into a different crypto-currency called dash. “Bitcoin is expensive,” Kwon, a mother, investor, Korean interpreter and U.S. Army veteran, said in a telephone interview. “I think dash has a bigger growth rate.” So far, it’s worked. Dash has risen to $46 from $15.20 when Kwon started, according to prices at CoinMarketCap. With a market value of $326 million, dash has become the third-largest crypto-currency, behind bitcoin and ether. Other digital currencies are on the move, too, including monero and zcash, to name some of the 700-plus out there. Investors who feel they missed out on bitcoin are seeking a different path to crypto-riches. “They think they’ve missed most of the move, so they are starting to look at other coins that could be their ticket,” said Adam Wyatt, chief operating officer of the crypto-currency researcher BullBear Analytics. Trading crypto-currencies is speculative. Characteristics that may give each version value include a restricted supply, the willingness of merchants to accept it as terms of trade, technical features and ultimately the faith investors put in it. Chris Burniske, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, sees signs that some investors are cashing out of bitcoin and putting funds into so-called alt coins, varieties that haven’t gone up as much. His company operates an exchange traded fund with 5 percent of its assets in blockchain -- the database technology underlying bitcoin -- and peer-to-peer computing. Bitcoin fell 0.5 percent to 1,239.35 Tuesday in New York. It’s up 30 percent this year. Others are trying to hedge as bitcoin approaches possible speed bumps: The first bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund is expected to be rejected or approved by U.S. regulators by March 11, and the price has risen in anticipation of new investor interest in the digital currency. A decision -- one way or the other -- could lead to more volatility. With a rejection, “probably the entire crypto-currency market as a whole could drop,” said Alex Sunnarborg, an analyst at researcher CoinDesk, said in an interview. Another issue facing bitcoin is network speed, which has been sluggish. At high congestion times, bitcoin transactions have taken hours to clear. While that’s faster than a traditional cross-border money transfer through a bank, it’s too slow for some users. Bitcoin developers are having trouble agreeing on ways to scale up the network, and the deadlock is pushing some investors to look at the alternative coins. “This creates tension and uncertainty,” said Leah Stephens, a Kansas City-area writer who has investments in crypto-currencies such as steem, dash, monero and bitcoin. “Many traders are hedging in alt coins because of these reasons.” Other coins have features that bitcoin lacks: Dash transactions are confirmed much faster, so it may be better for payments, Kwon said. Many of the coins that are on a tear -- such as dash, monero and zcash -- offer extra privacy protection. “What I think you are seeing is dash emerging as a true challenger to bitcoin in the market,” said Ryan Taylor, director of finance at the team that developed dash. “We are doing it by adding features customers really like. What you are seeing is recognition on the part of the users.” Smaller markets also present major disadvantages: The currencies tend to be less liquid, and more volatile. Large holdings of dash, for example, are concentrated in several thousand hands, Burniske said. Not that that’s deterring investors like Kwon, who are partial to crypto-currencies because they reduce dependence on money regulated by central banks. “We need some alternative currency other than fiat currency, and bitcoin is too slow and expensive,” Kwon said."
2017-03-08T14:00:00.000Z,Bitcoin Tax Fight Brews as Digital Chamber Set to Battle IRS,"Matthew Leising
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-08/bitcoin-tax-fight-brewing-as-digital-chamber-set-to-battle-irs,"Users of virtual currencies like bitcoin are backing an industry group to oppose tax authorities’ efforts to collect detailed information about the customers of a popular digital currency exchange. The tax group was formed because the Chamber of Digital Commerce believes a U.S. government summons for broad user information against Coinbase Inc. would, if successful, set a terrible precedent, said Perianne Boring, president of Washington D.C.-based group. Members of the Digital Assets Tax Policy Coalition are so worried, Boring said that they don’t want to be publicly named as participants for fear of being targeted by the Internal Revenue Service. “The companies are very afraid to speak out, so the chamber will be the face of this,” Boring said. The IRS in 2014 classified all virtual currencies as property for tax purposes, meaning the assets -- much like a home -- can be sold at a profit and trigger tax implications. In November the agency served a summons against Coinbase, seeking details about customers who traded digital currencies from 2013 to 2015. If the government has its way, it could open the door for similar actions against the rest of the industry, said Boring. Matthew Leas, an IRS spokesman, declined to comment on the issue, citing the agency’s litigation against Coinbase. Bitcoin has grown into the largest digital currency in the world, with a market value of about $20 billion. Like ether and other virtual currencies, bitcoin is made possible by a blockchain, a type of software that works as an account ledger on computers all over the world. The ledger tracks, verifies and records every use of a bitcoin to ensure the coins are valid and makes it almost impossible to change a past transaction. Bitcoin users are difficult to trace as the entire network, including their identities, is encrypted with no central authority keeping track of who’s who. Bitcoin fell 4.4 percent Wednesday, to $1,190.27 at 1:46 p.m. New York time. In the past year it’s gained 189 percent. Coinbase, based in San Francisco, said in a January post on its blog that it agrees with the IRS that users of digital currencies need to pay their taxes, and noted that the exchange has in the past responded to the agency’s subpoenas for specific customers. “Their most recent subpoena asks us to turn over records on all customers (including transaction history, IP addresses, transcripts with customer support, etc),” Brian Armstrong, co-founder and CEO of Coinbase, said in the blog post. “We feel the IRS’s subpoena is overly broad and incorrectly implies that all users of virtual currency are evading taxes.” The company has filed procedural motions in the case, David Farmer, a director, said in an email. The timing of enforcement proceedings has yet to be determined and is outside Coinbase’s control, he said. The IRS action against Coinbase was in the form of a John Does summons. While the tax authority said at the time that Coinbase was not being accused of wrongdoing, “the IRS uses John Doe summonses to obtain information about possible violations of internal revenue laws by individuals whose identities are unknown,” the agency said in a November statement. The chamber is using Steptoe & Johnson LLP as a legal adviser for the tax group, according to an announcement on Wednesday. “Tax solutions that allow the IRS to do its job without resorting to actions such as a John Doe summons will be of benefit to all,” Jason Weinstein, a partner at Steptoe and co-chair of its blockchain and digital currency practice, said in the announcement. — With assistance by Lynnley Browning"
2017-03-08T10:48:12.470Z,China's Top Bitcoin Exchanges Extend Suspension of Withdrawals,,https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-08/china-s-top-bitcoin-exchanges-extend-suspension-of-withdrawals,"China’s three largest bitcoin exchanges have extended a self-imposed moratorium on all coin withdrawals for an indefinite period, as they seek regulatory approval for a crypto-currency that’s gained popularity with local investors as an alternative to the yuan. BTC China, Huobi and OKCoin said in separate statements Wednesday that the suspension will lift only after regulators approve internal compliance upgrades. The three temporarily halted withdrawals last month, citing central bank requirements to re-tool such systems. Huobi and OKCoin have said it will take about a month to adjust to the new guidelines. BTC China didn’t give a time. Bitcoin prices were down 2.6 percent at 5:58 p.m. local time, paring a loss of as much as 6 percent earlier. The price recovery began soon after the exchanges made their announcements around 4 p.m. The digital currency, which last week passed the price of an ounce of gold for the first time, has come under increased scrutiny by Chinese authorities worried about money laundering and capital flight. Wednesday’s move suggests Chinese authorities’ are sticking to their hard-line stance on the cryptocurrency. People’s Bank of China official Zhou Xuedong told Bloomberg News on Tuesday that bitcoin regulation introduced previously wasn’t temporary. China has taken a central role in the bitcoin market in recent years as its citizens became leading traders and miners, deploying the vast computing power needed to make transactions with the cryptocurrency possible. Their interest was fueled by a hunt for alternative assets, zero exchange fees and the low cost of electricity to run mining computers. Demand from investors in Asia’s largest economy, home to most of the world’s bitcoin trades, has fueled a three-fold increase against the dollar over the past year. But the authorities are concerned, among other things, that bitcoin’s being used to spirit money out of the country, undermining official efforts to clamp down on capital outflows and prop up the yuan. The PBOC told nine bitcoin exchanges during a meeting in Beijing last month that it will close exchanges that violate rules on foreign exchange management, money laundering, payments and settlement.  — With assistance by Gary Gao, and Benjamin Robertson"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-06/bitcoin-gold-and-the-risks-of-bum-comparisons,"One simple chart is creating a lot of buzz in markets. It shows that for the first time in history, one bitcoin is worth more than one troy ounce of gold. Despite the flurry of discussion this factoid has generated, many are stupefied, not quite knowing what to do with this information or how to trade on it. Maybe it’s because they have little to do with each other.  In fact, gold and bitcoin don’t even represent the same asset class. Comparing them is not like apples and oranges (both fruit). Better said, it’s akin to comparing the prices of soybean futures and Intel stock. Many may argue that both gold and bitcoin are currencies as they can be used to purchase goods and services. Or, they may say both are commodities in that they have strict rules around meeting specified minimum standards and have associated futures and options contracts. But economics 101 argues that gold is a commodity and bitcoin and blockchain are technology. THE CURRENCY ARGUMENT:Neither are currencies. By definition, a currency is used as a medium of exchange and a widely accepted and circulated means of payment. Gold’s classification as a commodity-backed currency is largely a relic of history from the early days of capitalism when one could exchange gold for a cow. But that model didn’t work because there was often a gold shortage. Gold is surely a tradeable instrument and an asset-backed currency, as it can be exchanged for a given quantity of dollars, but try buying groceries with a nugget. Unless another Bretton Woods-type fixed exchange rate is enforced, gold is not tied to anything.Undoubtedly, bitcoin is becoming a more accepted means of payment by stores such as Home Depot, for online transactions, or Expedia.com, and more nations, such as Estonia and Denmark. But it’s still not widely accepted worldwide -- at least not yet.A currency is defined as valuation through fiat, meaning nations use it in monetary policy. The Federal Reserve can print as many dollars as deemed necessary to stimulate the economy. While more than 50 banks have joined the R3 consortium to incorporate blockchain technology, bitcoin is not reliant on third parties such as governments and banks. Unlike currencies, both gold and bitcoin have finite supply. The earth’s supply of gold is limited by to what remains underground while the creation of bitcoin is capped at 21 million.THE SUBSTITUTION ARGUMENT:The first use of gold was around 700 B.C., and since then, no one has discovered or created anything that has gold’s exact characteristics. Metallurgists have blended alloys to look and feel like gold, but their results are not gold and do not meet the standards for physical delivery. Bitcoin, on the other hand, has many substitutes as myriad “altcoin” cryptocurrencies have sprung up to challenge it, such as ethereum and its beta model, Casper, an alternative to the mining-based model, and ostensibly more secure.According to cryptocoincharts, there are 3,694 cryptocoins with a $27.8 billion market cap. Granted, bitcoin has an overwhelming share of the marketplace, but who knows what the future holds should other cryptocurrencies gain ground with technologies that challenge or disrupt the current marketplace. It was’t that long ago that Mt. Gox Exchange had many of its bitcoins stolen. Even last summer, a project running on a blockchain technology was hacked and lost millions of dollars. So yes, there’s room for improvement. THE COMMODITY ARGUMENT:Point blank, gold is a commodity, bitcoin is not. Gold is a classic commodity, defined as a basic good or hard asset used in commerce and as an input in the production of other goods. One can take physical delivery of a commodity, which can then be smelted, crushed, blended or refined to some other form for use. While bitcoin is storable, it’s not physical and cannot be held, felt or transformed in anyway.  THE INFLATION/HAVEN ARGUMENT:  For centuries, gold has been considered a haven as well as an inflation hedge. These qualities are not necessarily steadfast as alternatives came about (e.g. Swiss franc, Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), the argument still holds. One cannot say the same for bitcoin. In fact China’s three biggest bitcoin exchanges recently suspended withdrawals after pressure from the People’s Bank of China over concern that bitcoin was being used to move money out of the country. And bitcoin hasn’t been around long enough to make the inflation hedge argument, seeing as there has been no inflation to speak of in its history, until now. Surely there are similarities. Both bitcoin and gold are rare, their prices can be volatile and each serves as an alternative investment for those lacking faith in fiat currency and monetary policy. Trading bitcoin is not as easy as gold, as one has to open a bitcoin wallet, then purchase bitcoins via online exchanges, or invest in an over-the-counter Bitcoin Investment Trust, often at a hefty premium to the cryptocurrency. Soon there may be a bitcoin ETF, as the Winklevoss twins await the SEC’s approval deadline of March 13. With that go-ahead, bitcoin will become an easier trade.Their relative values, nevertheless, are not revealing much of anything barring validation of the thrill of speculation. The recent rise in bitcoin’s value is in part attributed to tighter currency restrictions in countries such as China, India and Venezuela in addition to investors betting on a more relaxed regulatory environment under President Donald Trump. Thus, with emerging market currency instability, legitimate uncertainty around Trump’s policies, and expectations for a stock market correction, there’s certainly good reasons to buy gold too. Well, so much for that spread. This column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of the editorial board or Bloomberg LP and its owners.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-09/family-offices-dentists-and-quants,"Family offices. The foundational story of the American financial system is one of upper-middle-class financial capitalism, in which the ideal imagined investor is a thoughtful, financially literate but non-professional small investor who, with the help of a trusted adviser, buys stock in individual companies because they have good businesses and are fairly valued. Much of what is interesting in modern financial markets comes from the fact that that story is no longer true, is indeed viewed as a laughable myth by many savvy people. Who buys individual stocks? It has become an old-timey hobby for the modestly wealthy and eccentric, like model railroading. So now there are huge public companies that are mostly owned by index funds and ""quasi-indexers,"" diversified mutual funds who own stock in all of the companies' competitors. But our corporate-governance system is based on that older story of stock-picking individuals, in which managers' duties are generally thought to be to their shareholders as shareholders of that company, rather than to the shareholders' broader interests as holders of the market portfolio. There are tensions there. Or you have market-structure rules intended to protect individual investors, so they can compete fairly against the big institutions, even though a moment's thought will tell you that's impossible: The institutions have way more money and technology and time and access than the individuals do, and will of course have advantages in making investing decisions. But regulators pay lip service to the assumption of a level playing field, because the story of upper-middle-class non-professional investors needs that assumption to work. Anyway here's a story about rich people's family offices, which are becoming bigger and more numerous and a more powerful force in the financial industry, increasingly doing their own private-equity deals rather than investing in funds: Investment bankers are courting them the way they used to court institutions. One banker calls them ""insti-viduals,"" which I hope he's trademarked. This is very different from the story about index funds, etc., but it seems to me as a related phenomenon. Both are about, as it were, the hollowing out of the investing middle class. Nobody buys stocks any more: Now, either you buy an index, or you buy a whole company. More people are using the most generic budget form of investing, and more people are becoming institutions themselves and getting involved directly in dealmaking and corporate management. The old story, of broadly dispersed individual shareholders in a single company who delegate management authority to professional executives, is no longer the norm. Dentists. The foundational story of the American financial system is one of upper-middle-class financial capitalism, in which the ideal imagined investor is, let's face it, a dentist. Dentists are the traditional backbone of our financial markets, educated people with money to invest but no professional investing expertise. But with the hollowing out of the investing middle class, the dentists are hurting: Steve Stein is an 82-year-old retired dentist in Huntington, New York. A generation ago he'd have bought stocks when he was young and then transitioned into conservative but nonetheless yieldy fixed-income investments as he got older. (""My dad used to put his money in CDs, getting 15%,"" says Stein, of his dental-technician father.) Now that doesn't work as well, and Stein is 95 percent in stocks at 82. And he finds himself in Bertucci's, mingling with the other dentists and anesthesiologists, wondering what went wrong and what to do about it. Quants. Here's a story about how the quantitative investing business has changed over the last 10 years, in ways both reassuring -- -- and not -- Well sure but what are ""these strategies""? The basic process of investing is that you look at some historical information, you make some predictions about the future, and you invest based on those predictions. At that level of generality, that's not a strategy that can become crowded; that's just what the process of investing is. A story you could tell about quantitative investing is that, early on, computers could only look at certain kinds of information and make certain kinds of predictions. Most of the investing world was therefore off-limits to quant funds, so not that many quant funds existed and they all did similar stereotyped things. As funds get access to more types of data and develop more ways of analyzing it, they are not just changing what happens in the ""quant hedge fund"" sector: They are expanding what sorts of investing can be done ""quantitatively,"" applying quantitative techniques to a wider range of strategies.  So: Is that ""quant""? I mean, sure, yes, a computer is telling you how to invest. There is math. But ""reading between the lines of what analysts say about a company"" is not quite the same ""strategy"" as, like, on-the-run/off-the-run Treasury convergence arbitrage. Getting a gut feel about analysts' views is a classic job for non-quantitative human equity managers. It's just that now computers can do it too, and faster. Market making. Interactive Brokers Group, Inc., is getting out of options market making: A story that you often hear about modern U.S. equity market structure, in which internalizers pay brokers for retail order flow, is that it is bad for the retail investors whose orders get sold. That's probably not true: The retail investors get cheap trades and better prices than they would on the public markets. It's win-win for them. Various conspiracy theories posit that the retail investors nonetheless are somehow harmed, but those theories seem to be mostly -- not entirely! -- wrong. Instead, the real objection to payment for order flow is not that it is bad for the retail investors, but that it is bad for the market. If you take all of the unsophisticated small orders out of public markets and sell them to internalizers, all you have left in the public markets are ""sophisticated, professional synthesizers of short-term fundamental, technical and big data."" Providing liquidity to them is a much riskier activity than providing it to retail investors, or to a random mix of retail and sophisticated investors. (If you squint, it's another story about the hollowing out of the investing middle class.) This is usually a pretty hypothetical point -- it's hard to know whether spreads would be much tighter on the public stock exchanges if retail brokerages didn't internalize so many orders -- but here is some empirical evidence. When retail investors leave the public markets, public-market liquidity providers like Interactive Brokers are next.  The Perfect Scam. What is the Alberta Securities Commission getting up to these days? If that doesn't make you want to be an Alberta securities regulator, there is something wrong with you. This is pretty much my dream: designing, building, and home-delivering flyers for investment scams, without the risk of going to prison. (Or the payoff of a successful scam, but whatever.) ""Everything about the fake investment opportunity – from the company's name and logo, to Jonathan Fisher's bio and the colour of his tie – was extensively researched,"" by people who were probably having a lot of fun. I bet the tie was red. I should just do this freelance. Rent a room, print some flyers, put a tie on a British man, and then do a big reveal: ""No, hahahaha, we're kidding, you just got scammed! Just for fun I mean. I'm not going to take your money, and I don't work for a regulator; I just wanted to see the looks on your faces. Enjoy the free continental breakfast!"" I wonder if I could raise some funding for this. Elsewhere, here's a story about fixed index annuities. And here is ""How to Become an International Gold Smuggler."" Exams. I always assumed that the U.S. system of securities-professional licensing exams, whose main requirement is that you have to already have a job at a securities firm to take the exams that allow you to work at a securities firm, was some sort of guild-protection system, though I never quite understood how it works. It's not like the supply of Series 7 takers is that restricted. But here is a proposal from the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority to change the exam structure: I guess now every college student who wants a finance job will have to pay a fee to take the SIE exam to prove their skills and dedication, rather than waiting until they're hired and having their firms pay for it. Elsewhere in credentialing, Harvard Law School will accept Graduate Record Exam scores in lieu of the Law School Admissions Test. I don't want to give you legal advice, but here's some free law school advice: Probably don't go to law school if you don't want to be a lawyer. I mean it worked out fine for me. But it's generally a poor gamble. I'm not saying that taking the GRE instead of the LSAT is proof that you don't want to be a lawyer or anything, I'm just saying, don't go to law school if you don't want to be a lawyer.  People are worried about unicorns. Here's a story about how Stanford University is trying to fund startups founded by students like Evan Spiegel, who ""often hung around the offices of StartX, the school's entrepreneurial hub."" Obviously. We've talked before about the recurring fad for financing college education with equity rather than debt, and really Stanford has the opportunity to be a leader in this space. Instead of charging tuition, it could just demand like a 5 percent stake in all of its students' future startups. It's a portfolio model: Classics majors would just get free classics degrees, while the guy who builds the next Snapchat would pay a billion dollars in effective tuition. I actually do not see the downside here. ""Adverse selection,"" you say, but you are wrong; this would probably attract more potential startup founders. Young founders seem to love giving away equity in return for external validation and mentoring. They're as credential-driven as the rest of us, which is why they go to Stanford. Anyway Stanford isn't doing this -- StartX is a more conventional funding/incubator sort of model -- but it should. Elsewhere, ""Uber Technologies Inc. said Wednesday it will stop using technological tools to evade government officials seeking to identify and block the service’s drivers.""

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-03/bitcoin-is-now-worth-more-than-gold,"Bitcoin jumped to a new high Friday, a day after soaring past the price of an ounce of gold for the first time. One unit of the virtual currency was trading above $1,292.71 at 7:30 a.m. in New York, compared with $1,226.89 for an ounce of gold. The metal’s had a terrible week, declining for the fourth time in five days. The latest surge in bitcoin’s value has been attributed to tighter currency restrictions in countries such as China, India and Venezuela, as well as speculation about prospects under the Trump administration. Bitcoin still has a lot to prove, John Butler, head of wealth services for GoldMoney, said in an interview. “We’re a long way from bitcoin establishing its properties as anything that could be considered to be a reasonably stable store of value,” Butler said. “The fact that it’s passing through gold is just arbitrary.” China’s three biggest Bitcoin exchanges suspended withdrawals last month after pressure from the People’s Bank of China, which was concerned people were using bitcoin to move money out of the country, sidestepping official efforts to shore up the yuan. Investors may also be betting on a more relaxed regulatory environment under U.S. President Donald Trump. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission is expected to rule on a proposal for an exchange-traded fund based on the digital currency by March 11. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain “Some people may be frontrunning what they see as the ETF demand down the road,” Butler said. In January, the volatile cryptocurrency passed its 2013 peak of $1,137. After the previous peak, it fell 53 percent in less than a month. Commerzbank analyst Carsten Fritsch noted “the small size of the [bitcoin] market” and “low level of distribution, the lack of general understanding of the concept, the short history of bitcoins, their extreme price volatility and the high proportion of speculators.” —With assistance from Eddie Van Der Walt."
2017-03-06T21:30:17.605Z,"The Daily Prophet: Stock Greed, Easy Money and Bond Market Zen","Robert Burgess
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-06/the-daily-prophet-stock-greed-easy-money-and-bond-market-zen,"The global stock market has fallen for three consecutive days, its longest slump since January, as the number of items of concern grows. The Federal Reserve looks intent upon raising interest rates next week. The U.S. political scene is only getting more divided. Elections in Europe are proving an existential threat to the region's currency union. North Korea and Iran are test-firing ballistic missiles with impunity.  Fear not, say analysts, as greed will ultimately win the day. JPMorgan Chase & Co. strategists say investors who pushed equities higher in recent months on bets of faster global growth and inflation should stay the course. Fitch Ratings provided some support for that sentiment today when it said develop-market economic growth should strengthen to 1.9 percent this year and 2 percent in 2018, from 1.6 percent in 2016. Yes, that's hardly impressive, but at least its moving higher.   “Equities are continuing to defy numerous correction calls,” the JPMorgan strategists wrote in a research note Monday. “Activity momentum might be peaking, but we find that this is not enough to take risk off the table. One should remain constructive and look through any weakness.”EASIER CONDITIONSFitch says the acceleration will be led by the U.S., with growth in the euro zone and Japan expected to remain broadly stable. In fact, an index shows financial conditions in America are rapidly accelerating and are now the best since the first half of 2015. Investment-grade debt sales last week totaled almost $60 billion, the second-most this year. Rates for most types of consumer loans have fallen in relation to benchmarks.  JPMorgan Chief Executive Jamie Dimon said last week that credit in the U.S. has “never been better, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever.”  BOND MARKET ZENMaybe one reason that stocks investors seem so confident is that the bond market appears to be taking the potential for a faster pace of rate hikes from the Fed in stride. Bank of America Merrill Lynch’s MOVE index, which is a measure of anticipated volatility in the market for U.S. Treasuries, has been trending lower. That dovetails with other bond metrics that show the market's confidence in the Fed's ability to keep inflation from accelerating and eroding the value of fixed-income payments. BANK CONFIDENCEOr, maybe it's related to confidence in the banking sector. It's widely known that U.S. financial shares have done very well since the presidential election on the prospect for reduced regulations and higher interest rates that could boost profit margins. Less well known is that measures of bank stress levels are tumbling. A gauge of where markets see bank borrowing costs in coming months, known as the FRA/OIS spread, is the lowest since mid-2015. The six largest U.S. banks could see annual profit jump an average of 14 percent if President Donald Trump delivers on his promise to cut corporate taxes, data compiled by Bloomberg show. MIGHTY AUSSIEThe best major currency this year is Australia's. The Aussie dollar has strengthened 4.51 percent against a basket of nine other developed-market peers. The performance of the local economy has recently been beating economists' estimates. Reserve Bank of Australia Governor Philip Lowe said last month that the headwinds for his country from falling commodity prices had turned into a “gentle” tailwind beginning in mid-2016. In a few hours the RBA meets to decide interest rates, and no change from teh current 1.50 percent target is expected. TEA LEAVESThe White House trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said yesterday that if the U.S. is able to reduce its trade deficit ""through tough, smart negotiations, we should be able to increase our growth rate.'' If economists' forecasts for January's trade deficit are any indication, those negotiations can't come soon enough. Imports are seen exceeding exports by $48.5 billion, up from $44.3 billion in December and the biggest gap since early 2012. An improving economy makes it tough to shrink the gap as steady U.S. consumer spending drives imports.

2017-03-07T14:37:01.249Z,Quant Hiring and Friendly Tippers,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-07/quant-hiring-and-friendly-tippers,"Quants. I went to work at a derivatives desk at a big investment bank almost 10 years ago, and at the time there was sort of a standard model for how banks and trading firms acquired quants. (To be clear, I was not a quant.) Basically you'd go to a physics Ph.D. student and say: Look, if you stay in physics, you will work for years on some abstract problem, making only slow progress to some vague impractical goal, and also you will be poor. If you come to a bank, you will solve real problems every day, and you will be rich. And the physicists would scoot off to the banks, where they'd immediately stop doing physics. They'd do a different thing, called ""quantitative finance."" (Derivatives pricing, quantitative risk modeling, that sort of thing.) It uses some of the mathematical techniques and Brownian-motion intuitions of physics, but the problems and equations are different. Nishant Kumar and Katia Porzecanski have an article about how trading firms acquire quants today, and it is subtly different. There is some superficial stuff (hackathons!), but overall the way that quant-focused firms like Winton, Two Sigma and Citadel recruit is much more academic than it used to be: ""By having our employees able to sit in the same room, share the same coffee with the academics, we find that there’s a fantastic osmosis,"" says the chief executive officer of Man Group. ""It’s a bit like CERN where scientists worked together to discover the Higgs particle,"" says the head of human capital at Winton. The appeal is not finance as a more practical, faster-moving alternative to academia. The appeal is finance as a continuation of academia. The goal is to collapse the differences between finance and science, rather than highlight them. I suspect that part of the difference is that the vogue in finance is for data science, while classic quantitative finance -- quantitative risk management, derivatives structuring -- is perhaps less popular than it was in 2007. And while ""quantitative finance"" is a different field from ""physics"" that happens to use some of the same math and some of the same people, ""data science"" is ""data science,"" regardless of what specific problems it is applied to. We've talked before about Renaissance Technologies, the wildly successful hedge fund that mostly hires people without finance backgrounds, perhaps because (in my words) investing is ""a trivial application of broader data-science principles, best addressed by people who were trained on harder and more interesting applications.""  The old model of quantitative finance made finance into a sort of science, and then recruited people from the physical sciences to build its models and run its experiments. But moving from physics to finance meant abandoning physics. The new model of machine-learning-based finance makes finance into just a set of problems in data science. You can run a hedge fund without ever abandoning data science, or the university setting, or your academic colleagues, or your self-conception as a scientist. Insider trading. Mathew Martoma, you may recall, is the former SAC Capital Advisors analyst who went to prison for insider trading on the results of some drug trials. That happened way back in 2014. Since then, there have been some developments in insider trading law. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit revived the Supreme Court's ""personal benefit"" test in its Newman decision: It's not enough for prosecutors to prove that you got a tip from a corporate insider, the court held; they also have to prove that the insider got some benefit from the tip. And then last year, the Supreme Court pared that decision back in its Salman decision, holding essentially that if the insider tips a close friend or family member, then that's enough to satisfy the personal benefit test. The interesting battles, now, will be about tippers and tippees who aren't close friends. We talked last week about an appeals court decision finding that a golf-buddy relationship was sufficient to satisfy the personal benefit test. Eventually, an investor-relations employee at a company is going to give color on upcoming earnings to a hedge-fund analyst as part of his job, and prosecutors will claim that he got a personal benefit because he occasionally made small talk with the analyst and they were therefore friends, and the cycle will repeat. The basic intuition is that information passed along out of self-interested personal corruption is illegal, while information that is passed along out of corporate investor-relations purposes is not. But this is a hard distinction to police, and anyway prosecutors don't really believe it, because they want insider trading law to guarantee a level playing field for investors. Meanwhile, though, Mathew Martoma is appealing his case on the theory that the doctors who tipped him off to the drug trial results were just business associates of his, not close friends. ""The Second Circuit will have to decide how much of Newman’s analysis survives when it moves into a murkier area that mixed together business dealings and some measure of personal friendship,"" writes Peter Henning. Will it? I mean, I buy Martoma's argument that his relationships with the doctors were not close friendships, and that casual work friendships should not give rise to insider trading liability. But also ... Martoma ... just ... paid them? Both of the doctors who tipped Martoma had been hired by SAC as ""expert network"" advisers, and were paid thousands of dollars for the information they provided. One tipster-doctor, Sidney Gilman, got $70,000 for his consulting; the other got $1,500 per hour. That seems like a pretty clear personal benefit? Martoma argues in his appeal that Gilman ""himself testified that he was paid nothing 'in exchange for' the disclosure of the efficacy data on which Martoma allegedly traded,"" but the prosecutors seem rightly skeptical: It can't seriously be the law that if you pay someone thousands of dollars for information about a company, and he gives you inside information about the company, it's not insider trading if you weren't also close friends. But the law is so muddled right now that smart people seem to think that that's a plausible argument. Meanwhile, here are Kevin Haeberle and M. Todd Henderson: Don't hold your breath. What I like about this is that you can sort of divide investors into three categories: I realize that this oversimplifies, but still. This plan would allow companies to extract some value from category 1. It wouldn't affect category 2. (""It is unlikely that those merely investing for a long-term, market-wide risk premium would pay for early access to public-company information,"" so ""they could avoid the periods in which speculating pros are battling it out to determine the import of new information for securities prices, and then safely return to the market to complete their non-time-sensitive trading."") And it would at least make it really clear to category 3 that, oh yes, someone else has better information than you. Snap cracks after pop. Snap Inc., whose stock popped Thursday and Friday after it priced its initial public offering Wednesday night, cracked yesterday, closing at $23.77. That's below where it opened for public trading on Thursday ($24), though still well above the $17 IPO price. What has changed? Well, one thing that happened is that research analysts keep coming out against Snap: ""By Monday, five of the seven analysts who cover the company had a sell rating on it while two said hold."" Presumably all the buy ratings will come in when the underwriter banks -- who are currently in a post-IPO quiet period -- are allowed to release research, but there is no guarantee of that. Banks are free to underwrite stocks that their analysts don't like, and aren't allowed to push their analysts to give good ratings just to please their investment-banking clients. Maybe all the underwriting banks will come out with sell recommendations. I wouldn't ... count on it? They'd have had a tougher time selling the deal if the analysts were bearish. But it's within the realm of theoretical possibility. Another possibility: When a company first IPOs, it is very hard to borrow shares of its stock, so you can't really sell it short. Over time, investors actually get their hands on shares, brokers figure out where the shares are, a stock-borrow market develops, and people are able to sell short. The absence of shorting can keep up the stock for a while: If you think Snap is underpriced, you can buy it, but if you think it's overpriced, you can't short it. But that eventually ends. Snap's IPO is scheduled to settle today -- that is, today is when the shares are actually supposed to be delivered by the underwriters to the investors -- and perhaps we'll start to see more shorting. Until then, teens are buying Snap stock. The London Whale. I enjoyed this profile of former ""London Whale"" and current grumpy unemployed man Bruno Iksil: Iksil complains a lot now about the ""London Whale"" name, but at the time he was ... just totally cool with everyone knowing his positions and trading against him? Of course he was right that he was not ""a typical hedge fund manager"": He was making long-term hedging trades, and had JPMorgan Chase & Co.'s massive balance sheet behind him. He could last a really long time before he cracked. But that made it worse when he did. Also: I feel like you see a lot of that sort of thing after blow-ups. Rogue traders, Libor kingpins, guys who lose a billion dollars: Their colleagues rarely describe them as ""oh yeah, he was a pretty stereotypical trader bro, really into pranks."" It's always ""he was quiet and didn't fit in with the other traders."" If you're a bank and are worried about operational risk, should you limit your hiring to trader stereotypes? Meanwhile: ""Fed May Take Legal Action Against ‘London Whale.’"" ISDA basis. Here's a delightful Alphaville guest post by Marcello Minenna about what the credit-default swap market for European sovereign debt says about fears of a euro breakup. The idea is that there are two kinds of European sovereign CDS contracts: ones written using the International Swaps and Derivatives Association's 2003 Credit Derivatives Definitions, which don't protect against currency redenomination, and ones under the 2014 ISDA definitions, which do. If you are worried about euro-area sovereigns dropping out of the euro, you should pay more for the 2014 contract than for the 2003 one. This difference is called the ""ISDA basis,"" and it used to be small, but now it is larger, suggesting that more people are worried. The key lesson is that when you are trading CDS you are betting on contract interpretation at least as much as you are betting on credit. What matters in a CDS trade is not just the general idea of ""credit protection,"" but the specific workings of the instrument that determine when and how you'll actually get paid. Using Bloomberg data, I see 5-year French CDS trading at around 30 basis points, with the 2003 definitions, or around 60, with the 2014 definitions. If you're buying 2014 France CDS to hedge against the risk of a euro breakup, half of your premium is going toward getting the right contract drafting.  Is there a too-big-to-fail premium? Not exactly, suggest Bernadette Minton, René Stulz and Alvaro Taboada: People are worried about bond market liquidity. ""The bond benchmark continues to tip to swaps,"" worry Lawrence Kreicher, Robert Neil McCauley and Philip Wooldridge in the Bank for International Settlements Quarterly Review: I guess that's not a bond market liquidity worry, or even a worry really. Meanwhile my Bloomberg Gadfly colleague Lisa Abramowicz is worried that long-term traders and short-term traders have different views on Treasury bonds.  Things happen.

2017-03-06T10:00:01.001Z,Russian Hackers Said to Seek Hush Money From Liberal Groups,"Michael Riley
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-06/russian-hackers-said-to-seek-hush-money-from-liberal-u-s-groups,"Russian hackers are targeting U.S. progressive groups in a new wave of attacks, scouring the organizations’ emails for embarrassing details and attempting to extract hush money, according to two people familiar with probes being conducted by the FBI and private security firms. At least a dozen groups have faced extortion attempts since the U.S. presidential election, said the people, who provided broad outlines of the campaign. The ransom demands are accompanied by samples of sensitive data in the hackers’ possession. In one case, a non-profit group and a prominent liberal donor discussed how to use grant money to cover some costs for anti-Trump protesters. The identities were not disclosed, and it’s unclear if the protesters were paid. At least some groups have paid the ransoms even though there is little guarantee the documents won’t be made public anyway. Demands have ranged from about $30,000 to $150,000, payable in untraceable bitcoins, according to one of the people familiar with the probe. Attribution is notoriously difficult in a computer attack. The hackers have used some of the techniques that security experts consider hallmarks of Cozy Bear, one of the Russian government groups identified as behind last year’s attack on the Democratic National Committee during the presidential election and which is under continuing investigation. Cozy Bear has not been accused of using extortion in the past, though separating government and criminal actors in Russia can be murky as security experts say some people have a foot in both worlds. The Center for American Progress, a Washington think tank with strong links to both the Clinton and Obama administrations, and Arabella Advisors, which guides liberal donors who want to invest in progressive causes, have been asked to pay ransoms, according to people familiar with the probes. The Center for American Progress declined a pre-publication request for comment. ""CAP has no evidence we have been hacked, no knowledge of it and no reason to believe it to be true. CAP has never been subject to ransom,” Allison Preiss, a spokeswoman for the center, said in a statement Monday morning. It’s unclear whether Arabella is part of the same campaign as the other dozen groups, according to one of the people familiar with the probes, but the tactics and approach are similar. If the Arabella attack came from a different group, multiple criminals could be lifting a page from Russia’s hacking of the 2016 campaign, attempting to leverage the reputational damage that could be inflicted on political organizations by exposing their secrets. “Arabella Advisors was affected by cyber crime,” said Steve Sampson, a spokesman for the firm, which lists 150 employees operating in four offices. ""All facts indicate this was financially motivated.’’ QuickTake U.S. Probe of Russia Hacking During the election Russian hackers heavily targeted the personal email accounts of staffers associated with the Clinton campaign. One of the people who described the current campaign said that in some cases, web-based email accounts are also being targeted because of their heavy use among non-profits. Along with emails, the hackers are stealing documents from popular web-based applications like SharePoint, which lets people in different locations work on Microsoft Office files, one of the people said. The Federal Bureau of Investigation declined to comment when asked about the latest hacks. It is continuing to investigate Russia’s attempts to influence the election and any possible connections to Trump campaign aides. Russian officials have repeatedly denied any attempt to influence the election or any role in related computer break-ins. “I would be cautious concluding that this has any sort of Russian government backing,” said John Hultquist, director of cyber espionage analysis at FireEye Inc., after the outline of the attacks was described to him. “Russian government hackers have aggressively targeted think tanks, and even masqueraded as ransomware operations, but it’s always possible it is just another shakedown.” The hackers’ targeting of left-leaning groups -- and the sifting of emails for sensitive or discrediting information -- has set off alarms that the attacks could constitute a fresh wave of Russian government meddling in the U.S. political system. The attacks could be designed to look like a criminal caper or they could have the tacit support of Russian intelligence agencies, the people said. Russia’s intelligence agencies maintain close relationships with criminal hackers in the country, according to several U.S. government investigations. None of the possible explanations for the attacks are particularly comforting to the victimized groups, few of which are household names but are part of the foundation of liberal politics in the U.S. Some of the groups are associated with causes now under attack by the Trump administration. Arabella’s founder, Eric Kessler, and its senior managing director, Bruce Boyd, worked for national environmental groups early in their careers. Arabella declined to make Kessler or Boyd available for comment. The Center for American Progress is a fierce critic of the Trump administration and its policies, and has called for a deeper investigation into contacts by Trump’s inner circle with Russian officials. It’s unclear if Trump or his top aides have been briefed on the investigation. The President has accused liberal groups of sending protesters to congressional town halls, mocking his opponents in a tweet on Feb. 21. “The so-called angry crowds in home districts of some Republicans are actually, in numerous cases, planned out by liberal activists. Sad!,” Trump tweeted from his personal account. Regardless of who is behind the latest round of hacks and ransom requests, there is also indication that state-sponsored hackers continue a broader targeting of liberal groups in the U.S. The day after the election, the FSB, Russia’s main intelligence agency, targeted the personal emails of hundreds of people, including national security experts, military officers and former White House officials, according to data provided by cyber security researchers who are tracking the spying and who asked not to be identified because of the risks of retaliation. The list was weighted toward people who have worked in Democratic administrations or who are linked with liberal causes. Among those targets was Kate Albright-Hanna. She worked for Barack Obama in his first presidential campaign in 2008 and then briefly in the White House Office of Health Care Reform. That was eight years ago. Since then she has worked on a documentary about corruption in New York and developed a network of investigative journalists and activists, not the most obvious target for Russian espionage. “I have no idea why I would be targeted,” said Albright-Hanna, who now lives in New York. “It’s super weird.” — With assistance by Jordan Robertson"
2017-03-02T10:00:00.003Z,Winklevoss Twins Await Imminent SEC Decision on Bitcoin ETF,"Olga Kharif
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-03-02/winklevoss-twins-await-imminent-sec-decision-on-bitcoin-etf,"Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss will know within days whether they’ve won approval to begin offering their bitcoin-based exchange traded fund, with the digital currency’s record rally hanging in the balance. Officials from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission met with the twins on Feb. 14 to discuss their proposal for an ETF based on the digital currency, according to a short notice of the meeting published on Feb. 22. A decision is due by March 11. The 35-year-old twins want to trade the security on the Bats BZX Exchange Inc. An approved ETF would make bitcoin investing simple for small traders and institutions, while potentially boosting the digital currency just as it’s hitting new highs almost daily. Some $300 million could pour into a bitcoin ETF in its first week, Spencer Bogart, head of research at venture-capital investor Blockchain Capital, said in an interview. “I’d be very surprised if it did anything but double from whatever levels it is at beforehand,” Bogart said. Bitcoin rose as high as $1,263.49 on Thursday, an intraday record, passing the price of an ounce of gold. It has gained 28 percent this year, as investors worried about global uncertainties and speculated on a more relaxed regulatory environment for the currency under President Trump. Hopes for the ETF have been a factor as well. The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is one of three such vehicles seeking regulatory approval -- and the advantages that come with being first. The others are Bitcoin Investment Trust, a creation of Barry Silbert, who had previously built a market for selling shares in private companies, and SolidX Bitcoin Trust. Digital Asset Services, the sponsor of the Winklevoss ETF, declined to comment. Silbert and Ivan Brightly, chief operating officer of SolidX, also wouldn’t comment. The Winklevoss twins may be best known for accusing Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg of stealing their idea for a social-media network, a case they ultimately settled. SEC approval could give enormous power and riches to the winner for years to come. Just look at gold: SPDR Gold Shares ETF, started in 2004, has more than four times higher the market value of iShares Gold Trust ETF, started in 2005. “This is the first-to-market race,” Chris Burniske, an analyst at Ark Investment Management LLC, said in an interview. Trading bitcoin now is no easy thing. Investors have to open bitcoin wallet accounts, then purchase bitcoins via online exchanges. Or they can invest in Bitcoin Investment Trust, which trades over the counter, often at a hefty premium to the cryptocurrency. A last possibility is Ark, which operates an ETF with 5 percent exposure to blockchain -- the database technology underlying bitcoin -- and peer-to-peer computing. With a publicly traded ETF, small investors could just call their brokers or buy shares online. Approval is by no means certain. On BitMEX, a contract betting on approval of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust spiked to an all-time high of 70 percent on Feb. 28, before crashing to 53 percent on March 1. Neena Mishra, director of ETF Research at Zacks Investment Research, pegs the chances at 40 percent. The biggest unknown is whether the regulators will conclude that bitcoin, a digital currency created on and managed by computers, lends itself to being a part of an ETF at all. Whether it’s secure enough, for example. Exchange Mt. Gox had many of its bitcoins stolen several years ago. Last summer, a project running on a blockchain technology similar to bitcoin’s got hacked and lost millions of dollars of investors’ funds. Read more: You Can Bet On Whether the SEC Approves the First Bitcoin ETF Bitcoin has similarities to currencies, as well as commodities like gold -- since there’s a limited number, it could be considered a scarce resource. What ultimately matters is how the SEC sees it. “Bitcoin is not a stock, it’s not a bond, it’s not a hard asset like precious metal, it’s not a commodity future,” Ben Johnson, director of global ETF and passive strategies research at Morningstar Inc., said in an interview. “It’s a technology that’s very much in its infancy, and it’s not something that in my mind lends itself to being packaged as an ETF.” An SEC rejection of the Winklevoss proposal could help one of the other bitcoin ETFs seeking regulatory approval. “If the Winklevoss (ETF) gets rejected, they’ll get a brief explanation, which will help the other guys figure out how to get theirs through,” said Adam Wyatt, chief operating officer at BullBear Analytics, a researcher focused on bitcoin and other digital currencies. “If it’s approved, all the other guys copy that and do whatever needs to be done to get approved.” Bitcoin Investment Trust, which filed in January to list on the NYSE Arca, already trades over the counter. Bank of New York Mellon is the trust’s transfer agent. And SolidX has a big differentiator: It promises to insure its bitcoins from loss -- something that could boost its chances of approval, Zacks’ Mishra said. The Winklevoss’s ETF, which first filed with the SEC in July of 2013, has amended its S-1 filing multiple times over the years to address regulators’ concerns. It’s represented by the law firm of Ropes & Gray. The twins have also secured State Street Bank & Trust Co. as the administrator of the trust. They already operate the Gemini cryptocurrency exchange, catering to institutional and retail investors. “All that adds up,” Eric Balchunas, an ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence, said in an interview. “If they are going approve one, it’s going to be Winklevoss first. And they kind of deserve it.”"

It’s the start of a new week -- and with that, a new travel ban, new ballistic missiles, and a new Mercedes SUV. While the news is still dominated by fallout from Trump leveling evidence-free wiretap claims against former President Barack Obama, there’s already a lot more going on. —Megan Hess Russian hackers are targeting U.S. liberal groups in a new wave of attacks, scouring emails for embarrassing details to extract hush money. At least a dozen groups have faced extortion attempts since the U.S. presidential election, according to two people familiar with probes being conducted by the FBI and private security firms. The ransom demands have ranged from about $30,000 to $150,000, payable in untraceable bitcoins. President Trump revised his temporary travel ban. Trump signed an order restricting entry into the U.S. by people from six predominantly Muslim countries, reviving a signature initiative of his presidency that stalled in the face of court challenges and sparked global protests. The new version, which takes effect March 16, removes Iraq, and its scope was narrowed to address legal questions raised by federal courts. But it’s certain to trigger a fresh round of challenges. The transgender bathroom showdown takes a turn. The U.S. Supreme Court canceled a scheduled hearing over the bathroom rights of transgender students in public schools, sending the case back to a lower court after the Trump administration changed a pivotal federal policy. A federal appeals panel had said a Virginia school district was probably violating U.S. civil rights law by reserving the boys’ bathrooms for “biological” males, basing its decision on an Obama administration letter that interpreted federal law as protecting the bathroom rights of transgender students. The most promising startups you’ve never heard of. While venture capitalists often try to assess startups’ potential one by one, some market researchers are trying to crunch data on tens of thousands of startups to come up with their own set of best-bets. These 50 companies, all founded in the past six years, have been raising money at an impressive clip—typically once every nine months, suggesting heavy interest among investors. Japan moved to the highest alert level after North Korea fired four ballistic missiles. Three of them fell into Japan’s exclusive economic zone, a government spokesman said. The latest provocations from Kim Jong Un’s regime “clearly show that this is a new level of threat” from North Korea, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told lawmakers in Tokyo. What happens to endowments when colleges close? Attorneys general will have to navigate legal thickets to dispose of relatively tiny sums as small colleges close at rates more than three times higher than before the recession. They leave behind not just physical plants, but the shriveled remnants of endowments, which are a source of frustration for donors’ descendants, vendors owed money and bondholders. Mercedes is making the world’s most expensive SUV. The new Mercedes-Maybach G-Class 650 will have a price tag of about $500,000. Limited to a run of 99, the SUV will have a V12 engine and a landaulet style, with a front row that’s covered and a retractable fabric roof in the back."
2017-02-28T10:00:00.006Z,Bitcoin’s Top Rival Is Up 90% and Ready to Ditch Mining,"Olga Kharif
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-28/bitcoin-s-top-rival-is-up-90-and-readying-its-next-big-move,"Marco Streng’s computer servers are what make Ethereum tick. Thousands strong, they whir day and night, solving the complex math riddles that are essential to verifying transactions on the hottest new platform in the world of cryptocurrencies and blockchains. Without these machines, or those deployed by Streng’s biggest rivals, there would be no Ethereum. But mining, as the practice is called, is costly and inefficient and, frankly, a bit weird. And Ethereum’s developers have always envisioned a time in which the cumbersome process of brute-force computing would be replaced by a system that relies simply on collateral. That time, some four years after the network was first proposed, is now. The developers want to put this “proof-of-stake” model, called Casper, into place by year-end. The stakes are high. If Ethereum is going to take advantage of the potential that companies like JPMorgan, Microsoft and IBM see in its underlying transaction technology, the blockchain, as the potential backbone that could reshape modern business and finance, it needs to gain wide adoption to become something of a de facto standard. Without mining, Ethereum “will be more usable, more secure and more scalable too,” said Vlad Zamfir, who’s been working on Casper since 2014. The main draw of the blockchain is that it’s a cryptographically secured list of transactions that can be shared, which backers say could dramatically improve how financial services, supply-chain and health-care industries are run. (Think immediate settlement of bank transfers and securities trades, as well as near-real-time tracking of food products or research samples.) Ethereum also allows for the use of “smart contracts,” or pieces of computer code that make the terms of such agreements operate automatically. Miners have been critical to the growth of Ethereum. The market for ether, the digital currency used to pay miners who support the network, has soared 90 percent this year alone. It’s the second-most popular cryptocurrency behind bitcoin, which has gained 24 percent in the same span, setting records almost every day as investors look to hedge against potential global uncertainty and hope for a bitcoin-based exchange-traded fund to get regulatory approval. Even before Ethereum was first released in 2015, developers had envisioned moving away from the mining-based model, known among tech geeks as “proof-of-work.” As the network gets more popular, the computations the miners need to complete to validate transactions get harder and harder. Not only has this created the potential for bottlenecks, like those already plaguing bitcoin, but it’s also set off an environmentally taxing arms race among the biggest miners, which run server farms consuming vast amounts of electricity. And to many techno-utopian enthusiasts, using all that computing power to continually solve what amounts to pointless problems is a big waste. That’s where Casper comes in. Rather than rewarding miners with the most computing power, the “proof-of-stake” model requires that users put up collateral if they want to collect fees for validating transactions. The more collateral you put up, the more money you can get paid for verifying transactions. It would take power away from miners like Streng, who have to approve software changes, and make it easier to implement improvements on the fly. A handful of bitcoin miners in China have already hamstrung some attempts to increase that cryptocurrency’s capacity. (Miners can’t vote against the switch.) The move will make Ethereum “more attractive in large-scale applications,” said William Mougayar, author of “The Business Blockchain.” Hyperledger, a blockchain venture with more than than 100 members including IBM, JPMorgan and American Express, could adopt Ethereum’s “proof-of-stake” model if it’s successful, according to Brian Behlendorf, the consortium’s executive director. It could also help put the network in “a league of our own,” Andrew Keys, head of global business development at startup ConsenSys, the world’s largest Ethereum-centric blockchain software engineering company. Making “proof-of-stake” work is hardly a foregone conclusion. Casper’s rollout has been delayed before. And the use of deposits potentially increases the risk of hacking. (While Zamfir said he’s working to make sure hackers can’t steal deposits, he couldn’t rule out the possibility, however remote, that an attack could, in effect, delete the money.) Streng, who stands to lose out if Casper is implemented, is wary. “There’s a lot of incentive for people to game the system,” he said. Trust in Ethereum was badly shaken last summer, when a hacker stole millions from a project called the DAO. Developers had to rush to implement a software change, which ended up splitting the Ethereum community in two. Now, each operates its own, separate blockchain. Zamfir says the benefits outweigh the risks. One of the biggest is “transaction finality.” Unlike most blockchain technologies, which require multiple verifications, settlement on Casper can occur much faster. With some enhancements, the feature could ultimately enable Ethereum to process more payments faster -- a key selling point for financial companies. Mona El Isa, a former Goldman Sachs trader who runs Melonport AG, which builds software for fund managers who invest in digital assets on Ethereum, is confident that developers can work out any kinks with Casper. “In these early stages of this new technology, you can’t expect everything to go right,” El Isa said. If Casper ultimately happens, Streng says it won’t be the end of the world. He can redeploy his servers to mine other cryptocurrencies or become a depositor on Ethereum instead. But he isn’t holding his breath just yet. Implementing such a sweeping change isn’t going to be easy and it’s still possible the plan could be scrapped altogether, he says. “The developers have very bright minds,” he said. Nevertheless, “they wouldn’t risk the Ethereum network, in my opinion.”"
2017-03-03T14:03:19.323Z,Snap's Pop and Hedge-Fund Charisma,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-03-03/snap-s-pop-and-hedge-fund-charisma,"Snap. The main worry about tech unicorns is a pretty simple one: Will public stock market investors pay more for tech companies than Silicon Valley venture capitalists? Traditionally the answer has been yes, which is why venture capital can be a business: Venture capitalists invest at lower valuations, then sell at higher ones. I mean it's not as simple as that: The model is that the venture capitalists invest in riskier, earlier-stage companies, and then cash out to the public when those companies succeed. But as companies stay private longer and private fundraisings get bigger, that model has broken down a bit. The recent concern about a ""unicorn bubble"" has been not so much that tech valuations are universally high, as that private-market valuations have gotten ahead of public ones. So good news! Snap Inc., whose last private valuation was about $18 billion last spring, priced its initial public offering on Wednesday at about a $24 billion valuation, and jumped on its first day of trading yesterday, closing up 44 percent at about $34 billion ($24.48 per share). (Those are fully-diluted numbers including options, etc.; the simple market capitalization numbers are about $20 billion and $28 billion, respectively.) Public investors were willing to pay almost twice as much for Snap as private investors were. Of course Snap is a year more mature now than it was in its last private round (though still not profitable), but that's the way it's supposed to work. The venture capitalists nurtured it for a while, and then passed it along to public investors who were willing to pay more. Snap is a weird unicorn, and may not be a harbinger of anything. But as other big tech companies ponder their own IPOs, the basic question will be: Can we get more money out of the public market than the private one? And Snap's answer is: Sure, yeah. Not only that! Snap's answer is that you can get more money out of public shareholders, and you don't even have to give them voting rights. Or mail them a proxy. Or worry about short-term-focused activist investors monkeying with your vision. Or be a profitable business. Or explain how you're going to be a profitable business. ""We’re going to have to go through an education process for the next five years to explain to people how our users and that creativity creates value,"" said Snap co-founder Even Spiegel, after the IPO. We talk a lot around here about how private markets are the new public markets. Private technology can now raise billions of dollars, at 11-digit valuations, from a lot of the same investors (big mutual funds, retail) that they would find in the public markets. The need to go public -- to raise money, to raise your public profile, to make your stock an acquisition currency -- has been diminished. Of course you still want to go public to cash out your venture-capital investors and your founders. (Spiegel and his co-founder, Bobby Murphy, each sold $272 million worth of stock in the IPO.) That works best when the public markets are at least as attractive as the private ones: when the public investors will give you a higher valuation, for one thing, but also when they'll trust the founders' vision as much as private investors will. Measured like that, Snap is a huge success. By going public with non-voting shares, it has cemented its founders' control and found a way to turn public markets into the new private markets. This success is obscured a little bit by the fact that Wall Street says mean things about Snap. Before the IPO, there was a lot of grousing from governance authorities about the non-voting shares. Since the IPO, according to Bloomberg data, five research analysts have introduced coverage on Snap, three with sell or equivalent ratings and two with holds. (Target prices range from $10 to $22, versus yesterday's $24.48 close.) This is in part an artifact of IPO rules: If you're a bank research analyst and are bullish on Snap, there's a good chance you're at one of its 26 underwriters, and will have to wait 10 days to initiate coverage. In general, though, Wall Street has a really effective way to express its collective opinion, and it's not by writing research notes or complaining to reporters. It's price. And measured by price, Wall Street loves Snap. What else? I suppose we have to talk about the notion, debated after every successful IPO, that Snap ""left money on the table"" by selling shares at $17 when it could have sold them at $24 (where the stock opened yesterday morning). That's not really true, first of all. Snap and its shareholders sold 230 million shares for $17 in its IPO (counting -- as you should -- the shares underlying the greenshoe option). About 26.4 million shares traded at $24 in yesterday's opening cross. (Total volume for the day was about 217.1 million shares.) Demand for shares is probably downward-sloping with price; Snap probably could have sold 26 million shares at $24, but not 230 million. But it could have sold the 230 million at $19, anyway, and didn't: Snap did leave money on the table, but intentionally. Getting the last possible dollar out of this offering wasn't the priority; making investors like Snap was. Which makes sense. Everyone here is a repeat player. The bankers, sure, want the deal to pop, because they will have to sell other deals and want investors to think fondly of them. But Snap's venture-capitalist private owners are also at least as invested in the broad tech-unicorn ecosystem as they are in Snap itself, and a successful deal on a high-profile unicorn does their next unicorn good. Snap's founder-owners are keeping far more shares than they're selling, so they want investors to remain bullish on the company.  Meanwhile: ""Simon Chiu, the president of Saint Francis high school in Mountainview, said the school board agreed to invest $15,000 in seed money in Snap in 2012, when the company was just getting started."" It cashed out two-thirds of its shares for $24 million in the IPO. Is there anything in Northern California that is not also a venture-capital investor? Apparently the religious high schools are. Are there any, like, volunteer fire departments or hippie communes on Zen monasteries or Girl Scout troops or animal shelters that don't have a sideline in seeding hot social media companies? Hedge fund succession planning. If you run a hedge fund, how do you get people to give you money? The basic answer seems to be that you persuade them that you have a rational, logical, repeatable process to produce market-beating investment insights. (Obviously having a track record of beating the market helps with this.) When they ask how you invest, if you stare at them, point at your forehead, and say ""it's my braaaaain,"" they will probably pass.  And yet. The thing about having a good process to identify good investments is that the market is probably the best process ever devised to identify good investments. The market has lots of people doing lots of things to find good investments, and a powerful weighing mechanism to aggregate all of their work into prices. What makes your process, run by a dozen people wearing fleeces in a room full of computers, better than the market's process, which is run by thousands of people in fleeces in thousands of rooms full of computers? I said the other day that ""investing in hedge funds requires a willing suspension of disbelief in the efficient markets hypothesis."" How do you cultivate that suspension of disbelief? Some hedge funds have plausible answers, processes that capture the imagination and might rival the market's. Bridgewater Associates' economic machine and relentless self-criticism, Renaissance Technologies' secretive machine learning: These are processes with long track records of success, but they also show an obviously genuine commitment to the processes themselves. If tomorrow all financial markets were closed forever, a thousand Bridgewater employees would probably still come to work just for the sheer joy of analyzing each others' flaws. If you invest in Bridgewater, it is because you believe in their process, and you trust that they do too. But if you go to the average -- or even the best -- fundamental equity manager and ask about his process, he'll be like ""well, we read a lot of 10-K's"" or whatever. (That's Warren Buffett's process!) The idea that most hedge fund managers have built proprietary machines for finding good investments that can rival the market's machine -- that can synthesize and analyze information better than the market can -- just seems implausible. But people give them money anyway! Sometimes they even beat the market! Sometimes they even develop long consistent track records of beating the market! I think any plausible story about how this works has to include some room for pure personal skill, some residue of investing acumen or instinct or luck that can't be reduced to a written checklist. The way you get the suspension of disbelief is through personal charisma: Deep down, the investor believes not that this fund has a robust process for finding good investments, but that this fund's manager has a quasi-magical intuition for finding good investments. Anyway succession planning at big hedge funds (and Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc.) is difficult, but why wouldn't it be? ""It can be challenging to groom the next generation when success is built on a founder’s skill and reputation."" It is not easy to pass on that unteachable residue, or to transform charisma into bureaucracy. Goldman cell phones. Here's a sad little story about how Goldman Sachs Group Inc. will now chip in 10 dollars/pounds/euros towards its bankers' cell-phone data charges, as opposed to just paying the bills itself. ""The new plan is rankling some dealmakers."" Two good rules of thumb are: The fact that Goldman has stopped paying the bills, and the bankers are complaining, suggests that neither of those two conditions is especially true any more. Disclosure: I used to work at Goldman, where I had a work-issued Blackberry. Come to think of it, I can't remember what that was like. Intellectually I am almost certain that I had a Blackberry and used it for work email, but I have no visual or tactile memory of carrying around a Blackberry or typing on it. I guess I don't miss it very much. You'll be okay, Goldman people. Happy bitcoin/gold crossover day! According to Bloomberg data and my calculations, one bitcoin would buy about 30.5 grams of gold at the end of Wednesday, and about 31.7 grams at the end of Thursday. This is of course a round-number milestone, but only if you weigh your gold in troy ounces, which to be fair most people do. A troy ounce is 31.1 grams. That means that, as of yesterday, ""the price of a bitcoin has climbed above that of a troy ounce of gold for the first time on record."" The canonical gold price was $1,234.25 (per troy ounce), while the canonical bitcoin price was $1,257.94 (per bitcoin), so congratulations everyone, that number that used to be smaller than that other number is now bigger than that other number. As meaningless numerical achievements go, this one is pretty meaningless, but, you know, what units were your Dow 21,000 celebrations in?  Should index funds be illegal? Goldman Sachs quant investor Andrew Alford says nah: Also: ""Active investing still occurs, but via thematic portfolios and/or at the asset-class level rather than via individual stocks."" Meanwhile, ""Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has amassed $3 billion in its exchange-traded funds in just 18 months, one of the most successful debuts in the industry."" And elsewhere: ""What exactly is in those Bible-based ETFs, anyway?"" Should you eat weed at work? This story about workday marijuana microdosing gives a useful taxonomy of companies where you should and shouldn't eat low-dose edibles at work, or at least, where you should and shouldn't talk about it on the record with a reporter. So go ahead and nibble if you work: Those are pretty obvious; I always assumed that a lot of law-firm IT managers were stoned all the time. On the other hand, skip the weed mints if you: Marijuana capitalists, yes; marijuana factory workers, no. What would Marx say? Elsewhere in workday weed: ""Bets on marijuana companies helped an Australian manager soar 145 percent last year to become the world’s best-performing hedge fund."" And: ""Trump Policy on Recreational Weed Seen as a Logistical Nightmare."" People are worried about unicorns. I mean, you'll never be lonely worrying about Uber: One problem with the overuse of corporate buzzwords is that you sometimes find yourself saying that your culture doesn't reflect your values.

2017-01-17T14:24:35.454Z,Snap Votes and Banker Bonuses,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-17/snap-votes-and-banker-bonuses,"Disappearing votes. There is a bit of a tradition of initial public offerings by hot internet companies where the founders sell stock to the public but keep control for themselves by setting up dual-class share structures and giving themselves high-voting shares. But then later they realize that they haven't given themselves enough votes -- if they issue new stock for acquisitions, or sell some of their stock for philanthropic purposes, then they'll lose control of their companies --- and so they have to sort of shamefacedly creep back to the shareholders and say ""hey would you mind giving us even more votes?"" It's fine, really -- the founders control the company, so what are the shareholders going to do, say no? -- but it's a little awkward. People complain. You end up with triple-class stock. It all looks a little dumb. There is absolutely no need to do it like that. Founders could just give themselves total permanent control at the time of the IPO: Instead of giving themselves 10-vote shares and the public 1-vote shares, or whatever, they can give themselves 10-vote shares and the public zero-vote shares. Then they never need to go back to the public shareholders to ask them to approve a new share class, or anything else. The founders can just run the company however they want, and public shareholders will be limited to putting up cash and hoping for the best. Snap Inc. is apparently planning to do it the right way: I appreciate their tidy-mindedness, which is not particularly evident in their app's user interface. (The other 30 percent of the voting power will apparently go to other pre-IPO investors.)  There is the usual guff about shareholder rights (""Some big investors contend that dual-class structures unfairly remove public shareholders from the decision-making process""), and about Snap's ability to impose this structure despite that pushback (""If you’re the only supply in the market, you’re well positioned to dictate the terms""), all of which feels a bit unreal. No one cares about this stuff. I mean, people care: Journalists and academics and governance experts love to talk about how bad dual-class share structures are. But in financial markets, there is only one meaningful way to care, and that is in price. If IPOs with dual-class shares came at a discount to IPOs with full shareholder rights, then this would matter. Bankers would go to founders and say: Look, you can keep control of your company by selling zero-vote shares to the public, but you'll raise less money than you would by selling full-vote shares. And the founders would have to make an economic decision about what they value -- informed by the fact that investors made an economic decision about what they value. But these are clearly not conversations that founders are having, and there's not much evidence of a price discount for dual-class IPOs. (""The difference in post-IPO performance between dual-class companies and non-dual-class companies isn’t statistically significant, both among tech companies and all U.S. listings."") Some people might care about dual-class stock, but the people actually buying the stock don't care enough to pay less for it, meaning that in a practical sense no one cares. One way to think about this is: Look, there is nothing particularly magical about voting stock. Companies raise money in lots of different ways, and those ways give investors different rights. Bond investors usually don't get to vote on directors or mergers. Stock investors usually do. Snap stock investors ... won't. Voting for directors is one way that stock investors traditionally protect their investments, but there are other ways to protect your investment, and Snap investors might be reasonably confident that they'll get a good return even without that traditional protection. Another way to think about it, though, is that no one cares because no one has ever had any reason to care. (Or at least not recently, and memories are short.) The high-profile Internet companies with the most egregious share structures -- Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc., which both went public as dual-class companies and then added a third class to cement founder control -- have made massive piles of money for their shareholders and are still run by active visionary founders who are liked by their investors. Eventually some tech founder will do some awful self-dealing, and investors will complain, but he'll get away with it because his dual-class stock allows him to ignore investors, so they will take their pique out on the next tech company that tries to go public with dual-class stock. (This happens in the bond market every now and then.) On the other hand, though, I don't know; people complained a lot when Elon Musk wanted to merge Tesla Motors Inc. and SolarCity Corp., and he was able to do it anyway, and they didn't have dual-class stock. Visionary founders can get away with a lot, whatever the corporate-governance formalities say. Elsewhere: The corporate governance business is dominated by women. (""But when we are hiring, we need to really push that diversity to make sure we have men on the slate."") Disappearing bonuses. During and after the financial crisis of 2007-2008, bankers' bonuses became a focus of public attention, and there was a lot of very heated and very boring debate about them. It went something like this: Do you remember when the U.S. Congress almost imposed a 90 percent retroactive tax on bankers' bonuses? I do! (It was of some personal interest to me, at the time.) It is easy enough to understand that a money-losing company would still need to pay its employees' salaries, but people just could not get their heads around the idea that a money-losing company might also pay bonuses. The 90 percent tax thing never happened, but the European Union really did cap bonuses at two times base salaries just because it felt like bonuses shouldn't be that big. Anyway time and economics seem to have resolved the misunderstanding: If you only give a bonus to the top 10 percent of your employees, then it is a bonus all right! That fits pretty well with the popular understanding. Next year maybe Deutsche will pay its bonuses in the form of $100 Starbucks gift cards, and the popular and bank conceptions of ""bonus"" will converge entirely, at least at Deutsche Bank. I have always been pretty skeptical about restrictions on banker bonuses. They seem to rest on arithmetic errors; paying someone a $1 million base salary and a $1 million bonus is in many ways riskier for the bank than paying her a $200,000 base and a $1.8 million bonus. But if banking bonuses become exceptional rewards for a job well done, and if most bank employees expect to get them rarely or never, then that really will change banks' culture. People talk about making banking boring again, and taking away bonuses will make it very boring indeed. If that's what you want! Meanwhile, in any other context you'd probably be annoyed by this: But now it's like: Bitcoin HFT! I assume the Venn diagram of ""people who invest in bitcoin"" and ""people who think that the financial system is rigged against them because high-frequency traders are allowed to co-locate their servers and front-run ordinary investors"" has a lot of overlap, so what about this, huh? Also I am going to go out on a limb here and guess that the risk of adverse selection in the bitcoin market is somewhat lower than it is in, say, the U.S. stock market. You're not trading against Fidelity here, you know? The basic raison d'être of high-frequency trading is that it makes markets more efficient, and that's not just a matter of enforcing the law of one price by arbitraging bitcoin prices across multiple platforms. It's also about efficiently extracting value from amateur noise traders and giving it to professionals.  Pound flash crash. Here is a Bank for International Settlements report on ""The sterling 'flash event' of 7 October 2016."" In the BIS's telling, it was the standard feedback loop of any market crash: Some people wanted to sell pounds, so the price of the pound declined, which led to further selling to hedge option positions, so the price declined some more, and stop-loss orders were triggered, leading to even more selling. ""The presence, outside the currency’s core time zone, of staff less experienced in trading sterling, with lower risk limits and risk appetite, and with less expertise in the suitability of particular algorithms for the prevailing market conditions, appears to have further amplified the movement."" Also: At the same time it's not as simple as saying ""high-frequency electronic trading causes instability"": The story is that the price dropped, so some traders stopped trading, which made liquidity worse, and then later they started trading again, which made it better. Some of that trading was electronic, and some of it wasn't, but there's no tight connection between electronic trading and withdrawal of liquidity. Fiduciaries. One basic problem with regulation is that you probably want some good thing, so you make a rule saying ""there shall be the good thing,"" but the rule doesn't just magically create the good thing. Instead, it creates an enforcement mechanism. The enforcement mechanism may tend to create more of the good thing, but enforcement mechanisms in themselves are sort of necessarily bad. They're coercive, they're punitive, they're bureaucratic, they're inflexible, etc. You can't create rules just because you want the good thing; you have to also want the enforcement mechanism. If you forget this, you get terrible consequences. So you don't like drug addiction, so you say ""there shall be no drugs,"" and you get mass incarceration. (And still drug addiction!)  Anyway here is Cliff Asness on the Labor Department's fiduciary rule: The point is that it would definitely be good if financial advisers acted in their clients' best interests, but you can't just decree that that will happen. All you can do is create an enforcement mechanism -- regulatory penalties and/or private lawsuits for advisers who don't act in their clients' best interests -- and that mechanism will not correspond precisely to the good thing that you want. What is Bernie Madoff up to? This is so perfect that I can't quite believe it: I like that Bernie Madoff is enjoying prison so much because it allows him to be his true self. All those years, he was a massive crook, but had to go around pretending to be an upstanding businessman. Now, behind bars, he is finally free to let his crook flag fly.  People are worried about unicorns. As far as I can tell the list of top worries about unicorns goes something like this: ""For $8,000 this startup will fill your veins with the blood of young people,"" says this article, and this is not the first time we have talked about vampirism in the tech world. In addition to being an excellent plot for a television thriller, it is a lovely parable of Silicon Valley. The blood startup is called Ambrosia, and while it has some vague basis in medical research (it ""was inspired by studies on mice that researchers had sewn together, with their veins conjoined, in a procedure called parabiosis""), its clear inspiration is not science but myth, an atavistic throwback to magical notions of preserving eternal youth through vampirism. Nerd culture is about fantasy and science fiction, not science, which is why unicorns are called unicorns. And remember what Marx said. Elsewhere, Peter Thiel might run for governor of California in 2018, presumably on an ""I will drink your blood, you delicious young bags of meat"" platform. And Silicon Valley is moving to the right politically. People are worried about bond market liquidity. Well you know the problem: And here is the solution: I mean, it's a solution. Citadel is sort of the plug in solving problems about bond trading: If market-making is an economically useful function, and if banks should not be in the market-making business, then Citadel should probably do more market-making. Or someone else -- Jefferies? -- but if banks are really being forced out of the bond trading business, then someone has to pick up the slack, and Citadel always seems to float around these stories. Elsewhere, here is a report from the Financial Stability Board on ""Policy Recommendations to Address Structural Vulnerabilities from Asset Management Activities."" The first structural vulnerability is of course ""liquidity mismatch between fund investments and redemption terms and conditions for open-ended fund units,"" which you and I know is a bond-market-liquidity worry. The recommendations include more disclosure, ""liquidity risk management tools"" like ""swing pricing, redemption fees and other anti-dilution methods,"" and stress testing. Things happen.

2017-02-24T05:00:04.000Z,"Fintech, the Buzzword Finance Loves and Hates: QuickTake Q&A","Edward Robinson
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-02-24/fintech-the-buzzword-finance-loves-and-hates-quicktake-q-a,"You’ve heard it at conferences, in meetings and maybe even bandied about at dinner parties. Ever since a wave of financial technology startups emerged after the 2008 subprime mortgage crack-up, ""fintech"" has become shorthand for a digital revolution that could sweep away antiquated banking practices. But its definition has become so elastic that it’s hard to know precisely what it is, let alone what it augurs for a global financial industry in dire need of innovation. Here’s a primer. It’s a catch-all label applied to companies using the internet, mobile phones, cloud computing and open source software to make banking and investing more efficient. It’s divided into two spheres: consumer-facing companies that offer digital tools to improve the way individuals borrow, manage money and finance startups, and back-office ventures that help financial institutions streamline their operations behind the scenes. Fintech could reshape the financial industry and disrupt some of its biggest players. Already, peer-to-peer lenders use the web to match borrowers with investors, a model that’s shortened loan approvals to hours versus weeks at traditional banks. Online U.S. loan volume is expected to reach $120 billion by the end of the decade, up from $20 billion in 2015, according to Morgan Stanley. In investment management, giants such as BlackRock Inc. and Vanguard Group Inc. are using algorithms called ""robo-advisers"" to automatically adjust portfolios in accordance with a customer’s risk preferences. Some hedge funds are experimenting, with varying degrees of success, with artificial intelligence to make algorithms self-learning. In the capital markets, startups as well as stalwarts such as Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and the Bank of England are experimenting to see if blockchain, the freely available database that underpins the digital currency bitcoin, can replace existing methods of transmitting assets and currencies. Scores of institutions are also racing to use blockchain to simplify the way securities are traded, settled and recorded. All these endeavors fall under the fintech umbrella. Watchdogs around the world have generally welcomed fintech because it promises to make financial transactions easier, cheaper and more transparent. Janet Yellen, chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, has said blockchain technology could help improve the creaky global payments network, the system that links banks so they can move money around the world. Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England, said fintech could fundamentally change how banks, companies and consumers manage credit, spending and saving. But regulators, he said, must also consider how these technologies might affect the financial system’s safety and soundness. While fintech companies offer an array of financial services -- online mortgages, auto loans and retirement accounts of all kinds -- the convenience may lure some consumers into commitments they don’t understand or can’t keep. Fintech could also supplant neighborhood brick-and-mortar banks, leaving low-income households without access to checking and savings accounts or credit cards. Some high-flying firms have also stumbled. In May 2016, LendingClub Corp., the San Francisco-based pioneer of peer-to-peer lending in the U.S., ousted Chief Executive Officer Renaud Laplanche in a corporate governance scandal. Its shares lost half their value in five trading days. They’re in the early stages of figuring out how to protect consumers and the financial system without stifling innovation. The U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in December said it would begin issuing modified charters to fintech firms that would require them to follow some federal banking rules. Britain’s Financial Conduct Authority runs a ""sandbox"" program that works with early-stage startups to ensure they comply with regulations. Some fintech companies, meanwhile, are looking to limit regulatory scrutiny and expand their influence in Washington under President Donald Trump by forming and joining lobby groups. Yes, big-time. Venture-capital firms plowed more than $17 billion into fintech startups globally in 2016, a sixfold jump from 2012. Last year, China overtook the U.S. as the top destination for fintech investment. Singapore alone has more than 100 fintech startups. Only a handful of ventures have gone public, so investors are anticipating a wave of share offerings and acquisitions as banks hunt for technology they can use and fintech startups mature. Most definitely. After initially disregarding these startups as marginal, lenders now accept that technology is going to upend their industry the same way it has other sectors. While robo-advisers and other applications may help banks better serve their customers, these innovations could also displace thousands of jobs. Banks, brokers and other traditional players also worry that, as the rules are being written, fintech firms are using the advantage of being unregulated to grab market share. They’re trying to get in front of the parade. Some banks are leveraging their name brands and computer technology to experiment with fintech, often using approaches honed in Silicon Valley. Barclays Plc, for example, has supported 60 early-stage ventures in its ""accelerator"" programs in London, New York, Tel Aviv and Cape Town. The bank, which doesn’t take a stake in the companies, invites its favorites to develop proof-of-concept projects that could lead to a deal. Other lenders such as Citigroup Inc. and Banco Santander SA have formed venture funds to take stakes in fintech firms. But it’s difficult for some large banks to integrate new technologies into aging computer systems. As a result, big banks have been slow to make fundamental changes in their operations even as they invest more money -- and hope -- in fintech. — With assistance by Elizabeth Dexheimer"
2017-02-24T01:00:06.812Z,Even China Can't Kill Bitcoin,"Elaine Ou
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-24/even-china-can-t-kill-bitcoin,"Every time a government sets out to abolish something people like, the well-liked thing moves to where it can’t be stopped. This has happened with prohibition, gambling, the war on drugs and digital piracy. Now it's happening in China, where the government has been trying to crack down on bitcoin. As part of an effort to control capital outflows, the Chinese central bank required bitcoin exchanges to suspend withdrawals until they could update their compliance systems. Trading on the exchanges took a big hit, but the bitcoin activity resurfaced on less formal over-the-counter venues. Here's a chart showing trading volume at LocalBitcoins, a site where users post “advertisements” -- like on Craigslist -- to buy or sell bitcoin for local currency:
            
                
                1
            
         Blocking LocalBitcoins would be no solution, in part because people can use virtual private networks to access it anyway. Also, plenty of trading happens on lesser-known sites and on micro-messaging services such as WeChat and QQ. The latter already have their own payment systems, allowing users to build chatbots to automate trading activity. For those who prefer a more familiar trading interface, decentralized exchange software such as Bitsquare can construct an order book based on outstanding offers accumulated from other participants. China is not alone. Peer-to-peer trading took off in Turkey after the country’s only bitcoin exchange ceased to operate, and in Venezuela after the leading exchange had its bank account closed. Russia has some of the most active unofficial bitcoin markets in the world, thanks to the country’s longstanding regulatory uncertainty. Although centralized exchanges provide benefits, such as bringing together large quantities of buyers and sellers and guaranteeing payment, they’re not necessary for the currency’s existence. Bitcoin users don’t own physical coins, or even digital ones. They own permanent transaction histories recorded on a global ledger, replicated by participants all around the world. Even if a government shuts down every bitcoin node in its country, a bitcoin user can still transact as long as a single node is accessible overseas. QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain This puts regulators in a tough spot. It’s hard to control something that exists nowhere and everywhere at the same time. With peer-to-peer transactions, there are no servers to shut down, no kingpins to arrest, no warehouses to bust. Regulators can only go after local bitcoin exchanges and service providers, effectively impairing their own ability to see what's going on. Attempts to stamp out Bitcoin serve only to remind users why a decentralized currency needs to exist in the first place. Bitcoin gained prominence because its peer-to-peer payment system allows people to conduct financial transactions that can’t be censored by third parties. Users are free to transact with anyone, as long as they control their own private keys. The fact that many people still give third-party service providers custody of their bitcoin accounts is mostly a relic of our existing acclimation to banks. When regulators try to restrict bitcoin exchanges, they reduce trust both in the government -- which can't seem to keep its hands in its own pockets -- and in any kind of third-party financial service provider that might be beholden to the government. The best way to curb the use of bitcoin is to convince people that they don’t need the cryptocurrency. If Visa and Mastercard started processing payments for darknet markets and remittance customers, the demand for bitcoin would fall off a cliff. But that’s about as likely as China offering to ease capital controls. The U.S., for its part, could reform money laundering rules that effectively bar a subset of the population from the banking system. When regulations create barriers that prevent legitimate businesses from serving certain customers, less-legitimate businesses rise to meet the demand outside the regulatory system. Markets can’t be regulated out of existence. The next best thing might be to let them operate in the open.

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-11-21/goldman-quits-r3-blockchain-group-other-banks-said-to-be-next,"Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has quit the R3 CEV LLC blockchain group, and other banks may soon follow it out the door, said people familiar with the venture, a sign the financial industry’s leading blockchain consortium may be splintering. Goldman Sachs’s departure is tied to the structure of the consortium and its ability to work together, and not to the potential of the blockchain technology, said two of the people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because it’s a private matter. R3 is preparing its first round of equity fundraising, and the investment bank decided acquiring a sizeable stake with a seat on the group’s board would be too expensive, said two of the people. The exit marks a blow to New York-based R3, a group of more than 70 financial institutions, including JPMorgan Chase & Co., Bank of America Corp., and Barclays Plc. The group has set out to build a system for settling and recording securities transactions, as well as making payments, on blockchain-based technology. Charley Cooper, a managing director at R3, confirmed Goldman Sachs’s departure when reached by phone. “As with any project of this scale and scope, we always expected the make-up of the consortium to change over time,” Nick Murray-Leslie, an outside spokesman for R3, said in an e-mailed statement. “Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.” Banco Santander SA is also leaving R3, according to a bank spokesman. The Madrid-based lender has decided to concentrate its development efforts on other ventures involving the technology that supports digital currencies. Santander InnoVentures, the bank’s $200 million venture fund, is a minority stakeholder in Digital Asset Holdings, the blockchain technology startup led by former JPMorgan Chase & Co. investment banker Blythe Masters. Santander InnoVentures is also an investor in Ripple Labs, a San Francisco firm that is using distributed-ledger technology for banks. Read more: Why Wall Street’s so excited about blockchain For the last two years, R3 has worked closely with global banks to develop what could be an industry standard using the distributed ledger model that supports bitcoin. The goal is to reduce the time and expense needed in processing financial transactions, and make them more transparent for clients and regulators. Even so, banks such as Goldman have been developing their own blockchain-based projects in-house, obtaining payments for their own digital currencies, and investing in numerous startups specializing in the technology. The Wall Street Journal reported Goldman Sachs’s departure earlier Monday."

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-23/bitcoin-surges-above-900-on-geopolitical-risks-fed-tightening,"Bitcoin headed for its biggest weekly jump since June as rising geopolitical risks boosted demand for alternative assets. The cryptocurrency surged 15 percent this week to $900.40 as of 2:38 p.m. in Hong Kong, taking its gain this year to 107 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The last time it was at such levels was in January 2014, when bitcoin was tumbling from its record price of $1,137 following the implosion of the MtGox exchange and tightening Chinese controls. Bitcoin is extending a rally that’s beaten every major currency, stock index and commodity contract in 2016. Buyers sought alternative assets this week amid the killing of Russia’s envoy to Turkey and a separate attack that left 12 people dead in Berlin. Weakening pressure on the yuan, which intensified this month as the U.S. projected a faster pace of tightening next year following Donald Trump’s election win, is also increasing demand for bitcoin in China, where the majority of trading occurs.   “Terrorist attacks in Europe boosted haven demand in capital markets, and gold has been falling since Trump was elected,” said Le Xiaotian, an analyst at Huobi, a Chinese exchange. “Global instability has to a large extent directed funds to the bitcoin market.” Bitcoin, which trades in cyberspace and is mined by code-cracking computers, is gaining popularity among some investors as an alternative safe haven because it’s deemed to be less influenced by government regulations and changes to monetary policy. Gold, which tends to trade in tandem with bitcoin when haven demand is strong, has fallen this quarter as U.S. rates rise, narrowing its premium over bitcoin to the least in three years. “The Fed’s rate hike announcement has probably spooked a lot of emerging-market investors, particularly those in China, who are now flocking to bitcoin as a refuge from weak fiat currency assets,” said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Gatecoin Ltd. in Hong Kong. “As we’ve passed the $800 bitcoin price, a strong resistance point in the past, and move closer towards the psychological $1000 stratosphere, anything seems possible.” — With assistance by Darren Boey"
2017-01-09T11:01:39.554Z,Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day,"Lorcan Roche Kelly
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/pound-falls-yuan-volatility-and-fed-hawks-line-up-what-people-are-talking-about,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The pound drops, the yuan falls, and Fed hawks circle. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. The British pound was trading 1.1 percent lower at $1.2148 as of 4:55 a.m. ET following comments over the weekend from Prime Minister Theresa May which stoked fears that the U.K. will lose access to Europe's single market. In an interview with Sky News she said that regaining control of immigration and lawmaking are a greater priority than membership of the single market. Meanwhile, data from Halifax this morning showed U.K. home prices had a strong end to 2016, but the U.K. mortgage lender warned growth is likely to slow in 2017. The Chinese currency's lively start to the year continued overnight, with the offshore yuan dropping 0.4 percent by 5:20 a.m. ET, adding to a 0.9 percent fall on Friday. Last week, a short squeeze helped the currency to a record weekly advance. Over the weekend, the People’s Bank of China revealed that the country's foreign reserve holdings fell for a sixth month in December to $3.01 trillion, down from a record $4 trillion in June 2014. Fan Gang, an adviser to the People's Bank of China, said that additional measures to stem capital outflows are unlikely. With just over a year remaining on Janet Yellen's current term as chair of the Federal Reserve, comments from three of her potential successors at this this weekend's annual American Economic Association meeting are noteworthy. Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University, along with Stanford University’s John Taylor and Kevin Warsh, are all seen by Fed watchers as potential future chairs should President-elect Donald Trump decide not to re-nominate Yellen. All three criticized the U.S. central bank for trying to do too much, and suggested interest rates would be higher if they were in charge. Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 0.1 percent, with Japanese markets closed for a holiday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.4 percent lower at 5:22 a.m. ET while U.K. stocks traded higher as the pound fell. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.1 percent. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is in Washington this week as the U.K. seeks to strengthen ties with the incoming administration. The president-elect tweeted yesterday that he is looking forward to meeting Theresa May following his inauguration. Meanwhile, speculation is mounting that the PEOTUS will follow through on threats to label China a currency manipulator at the new review in April, despite the country only meeting one of the three criteria specified by the Obama administration.  This is what's caught our eye over the weekend."
2017-02-16T14:33:55.575Z,Unicorn Buybacks and Securities Law,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-02-16/unicorn-buybacks-and-securities-law,"People are worried about unicorns doing stock buybacks. No, they're not really worried, but I appreciate that Uber Technologies Inc. hasn't waited to go public to start doing stock buybacks from its employees. ""Those who work at the San Francisco company for at least four years can sell as much as 10 percent of their shares."" Two themes that I like to talk about around here are: Uber is the poster unicorn for the first theme, and I'd thought for the second as well, but perhaps it will become massively profitable and move to capital-return mode without ever going through an initial public offering. But not yet. Now it is losing money and being subsidized by (billions of dollars from) investors. Which makes the buybacks particularly fascinating: When I was an investment banker working on structured equity issuance and buybacks, one dorky joke that we had was that companies could do ""equity-financed stock buybacks."" The idea was that a company would issue new stock, and use the money it raised to buy back stock. This of course makes no sense -- it was a joke -- though it came up more often than you'd think. (Bankers like to propose trades, what can I say.) One reason it makes no sense is that it is pointless for the company: Issuing stock and buying back stock leaves you in the same place as before. Another reason it makes no sense is that it is pointless for investors: If outsiders want to buy stock, and employees want to sell stock, the employees can sell stock to the outsiders, and the company never needs to get involved. In Uber's case, where the stock is not public and there are restrictions on trading, this does not apply; the buyback program fills a real need for employees. But the deeper economic problem with the equity-financed stock buyback is what you could call the bid-ask spread. When public companies sell stock to the public, they usually need to do it at a discount: If your stock is trading at $100 before the offering, you're going to sell stock at $98 or $95 or whatever. (You're creating new supply, driving down the value; plus you are selling a big block and paying to get liquidity.) And when public companies buy back stock, they usually need to do it at a premium: If your stock is trading at $100 before the buyback, you're going to pay $101 or $102 or whatever in the buyback. (You're reducing supply -- and increasing earnings per share -- which drives up the value; plus you are buying a big block and paying to get liquidity.) So the equity-financed stock buyback -- selling stock at $98 to buy back the same stock at $102 -- is obviously dumb. With Uber -- with unicorns more generally, perhaps -- it's the opposite. Uber is, as it were, getting paid the bid-ask spread. Uber isn't paying for liquidity on either side of the trade; it's being paid for liquidity. When Uber sells stock to new investors, it can get a premium, because the stock is sexy and scarce and not available on the secondary market. When Uber buys stock from its employees, it does it at a discount, because the employees are desperate for liquidity and can't sell their stock anywhere else. Uber can make a profit just on issuing and buying back its own stock. I kind of don't understand why it would even bother building self-driving cars; it's already built a perpetual motion machine. Sexual harassment as securities law. One thing that we talk about around here is that all law is securities law: If a public company does a bad thing, chances are it has also violated the securities laws by failing to disclose that bad thing, and so the Securities and Exchange Commission has a universal jurisdiction to investigate whatever badness it can find. So securities regulators are also antitrust regulators, environmental regulators, gun-control regulators, automobile regulators, conflict-minerals regulators and regulators of political speech. And so of course a bunch of people pointed me to this story yesterday: Sexual harassment is not generally a matter for federal securities prosecutors. But the concern here seems to be that Fox entered into secret settlements of sexual-harassment claims against Roger Ailes and Bill O'Reilly that might have been material to shareholders. That does sort of look like a securities issue. Like, there are contracts, and money, and the disclosure of where the money went might not have been as clear as some investors might like. How did Fox document these payments in its books and records, and in its audited financial statements? It's relatively easy to recast this not as a ""sexual-harassment issue"" but as an accounting one. But: What if it wasn't? Imagine that a powerful executive at a public company sexually harassed many women over many years, but didn't reach settlements with them, and just intimidated them to keep quiet. Then one day they all went public (and sued). Is that a securities law issue? I think it might be. The executive's actions -- which exposed the company to the risk of expensive lawsuits and reputational damage -- are material to shareholders, just as material as any settlements would be. If the company didn't disclose those actions -- and it is in my experience rare for public companies to disclose a risk factor like ""our CEO is a lech"" -- then why wouldn't that be a securities-law violation? The SEC doesn't seem interested in acting as a universal sexual-harassment regulator for public companies, but if it wanted to it probably could. Elsewhere in SEC jurisdiction: ""The new Republican leader of the Securities and Exchange Commission has imposed fresh curbs on the agency’s enforcement staff, scaling back their powers to initiate investigations of alleged financial misdeeds."" Congrats Yahoo. In the back of your mind, didn't you kind of think that the revelations of hacking at Yahoo would lead to a breakup of its deal to sell its core business to Verizon and leave it back at square one? I just felt like in 2022 I'd be reading and writing about how Yahoo needs to either find a strategy for its core business, or find a way to get Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. to buy it, or otherwise figure out a way to escape the labyrinth in which it has found itself. But no it's fine, ""Verizon Communications Inc. is close to a renegotiated deal for Yahoo! Inc.’s internet properties that would reduce the price of the $4.8 billion agreement by about $250 million after the revelation of security breaches at the web company."" Yahoo will finally be able to get rid of itself and concentrate on what's left: its massive Alibaba stake, free of the distractions of the internet business. Although wait: Ugh, guys. We've been talking about this forever. What you need is a clean shiny box (Altaba) to hold your Alibaba shares, so they can trade like a proxy on Alibaba, and so Alibaba can eventually buy the box. That was the whole point of selling the core business: to put the Alibaba shares (and, yes, fine, some Yahoo Japan Corp. shares, and some patents) into a clean box, separated from a core internet business that, by some accounts, might be worth less than zero. Now Yahoo is smudging the box. Altaba will get rid of the actual money-making parts of the core business, but will keep the uncertain contingent liabilities. (Though not all of them: ""Verizon would give up its right to sue over the idea that Yahoo had covered up the hacks."") ""Core Altaba"" -- the Altaba remnants of core Yahoo -- will definitely be worth less than nothing. Good job everyone. Elsewhere in M&A second thoughts: ""Anthem Wins Bid to Block Cigna From Dumping $48 Billion Deal."" Chicken Libor! Here's a Bloomberg Businessweek feature on my favorite recent financial scandal, Chicken Libor. Well, not really. When I talk about Chicken Libor, I mostly mean allegations that poultry producers misrepresented chicken prices when they were surveyed for a widely-used index, thus pushing up the index price. (Like Libor.) But this story is more about broader antitrust concerns in the chicken industry, and focuses on a different survey: ""Agri Stats, a private service that gathers data from poultry processors, produces confidential weekly reports, and disseminates them back to companies that pay for subscriptions."" As one law professor explains, Man, antitrust law is hard. Transparency itself can create antitrust problems; telling your competitors how much you sell and how much you charge, with enough detail and frequency, can allow them to coordinate a cartel. I wonder if there are any lessons for the financial industry, as it moves toward a future of greater transparency and more consolidation. Correlation. Here is an article about how ""cross-asset correlation recently fell to its lowest level since 2006,"" even as more money continues to move from active to passive strategies. One obvious takeaway is that money always flows to the strategy that was just successful, not the one that will be soon. Passive investing dominated a world of stability, supportive monetary policy and high correlations; active investing is poised for a comeback ""when asset prices can go down as well as up."" So of course everyone is rushing into passive. There are some nuances to that story, though. For one thing, cross-asset correlations don't necessarily tell us much about active versus passive management: Most passive funds, and even most active funds, focus on one asset class. ""Passive investing"" is, in practice, about actively choosing an asset class, and then trying to buy the whole market for that asset class. If stocks are going to go up while bonds are going to go down, you can make money by buying a stock index fund and selling a bond index fund. And if you instead decide to buy an active bond fund managed by a brilliant manager, it's still going to disappoint you if the whole bond market is heading down. Also here's a great line: That is usually the big problem in investing. If all the things are the right things, then it's hard to distinguish yourself. If many of the things are the wrong things, though, it's hard to pick the right ones. Elsewhere: ""Record $13 Billion Pulled From Biggest Public U.S. Hedge Fund Och-Ziff."" Quants. ""Why are so many machine-learning experts writing high-frequency-trading code instead of curing cancer,"" people ask. Well: In general, the realistic alternative use for all of Wall Street's wasted talent is not curing cancer; it's optimizing the delivery of advertisements in Silicon Valley. An arbitrage. Aaron Brown wrote about ""an underappreciated magic to allowing diversity of numeraire"" (back when the dollar/euro forward was about $1.40): Here is ... maybe the opposite trade? Except:  Ah yes, but who is going to take that ""no"" bet against you, except you? Elsewhere, Kyrgyzstan's central bank wants all of its citizens to own at least 100 grams of gold. People are worried about unicorns. Snap seems unworried: I suppose that betrays a little worry -- previous guesses had gone as high as $25 billion -- but that's still a big IPO. Elsewhere in unicorns, or geese, or goosicorns, Canada Goose Holdings Inc. filed the papers for its IPO. People are worried about bond market liquidity. People are worried that it's hard to buy credit-default swaps on weird hybrid European bank debt: I never quite understand these complaints. Like, if you are buying weird hybrid European bank debt, isn't that sort of necessarily a bet on the credit quality of that particular bank and security? I can see why it would be attractive to have basis arbitraging instruments available, sure, and CDS is helpful for dealing desks, but I don't get why investors would need CDS. If you are worried about the credit, just don't buy the bonds! Things happen. Key Republican Casts Doubt on Quick Action to Dismantle Dodd-Frank.

QuickTake The People’s Currency The exchange rate dropped by 0.05 percent to 6.7806 per dollar as of 5:15 p.m. in Shanghai, after a 0.3 percent slump on Monday that was the biggest in a month. The latest data show China’s foreign-exchange reserves dropped last month by the most since January while exports plunged 7.3 percent, adding pressure for further currency weakness. The yuan slid for a sixth day against a basket of peers. Officials have stepped up measures to curb outflows as investors seek to hedge against a weakening currency and traders ascribed a higher likelihood that Hillary Clinton will become the next U.S. president. In recent weeks China limited the use of UnionPay Co.’s cards to buy insurance products in Hong Kong, while Bloomberg News reported authorities are planning to curb transactions that use bitcoins to shift funds out of the country. ""The larger-than-expected drop in reserves underscores capital outflows in October, and as we know central banks also intervene in the forward markets, the reserves data are hardly likely to give a full picture of fund exits,"" said Fiona Lim, a senior currency strategist at Malayan Banking Bhd. in Singapore. ""And there is wide expectation for the yuan to weaken against the dollar beyond the U.S. presidential election result. So all in all, risks to the yuan really are to the downside."" China’s currency is trading within 0.1 percent of a fresh six-year low, while the offshore rate was 6.7940 a dollar. A Bloomberg replica of the CFETS RMB Index, which tracks the yuan against 13 peers, has fallen 0.5 percent over the past six sessions to 93.71, the lowest level since the gauge was introduced last year. Reserves dropped last month by $45.7 billion to $3.12 trillion, the lowest since 2011, the central bank said late Monday. Outbound shipments fell 7.3 percent in October, compared with the median estimate for a 6 percent decline in a Bloomberg survey. Declines in the yuan have accelerated since the currency was included in the International Monetary Fund’s reserves on Oct. 1 and increasing bets for higher U.S. interest rates bolstered the dollar. The yuan has slumped 1.6 percent this quarter, taking its loss over the past 12 months to 6.3 percent, the biggest drop in Asia. A record $44.7 billion worth of yuan payments left the nation in September, according to the State Administration of Foreign Exchange. Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has warned such large cross-border moves can’t be explained by market-driven factors and need to be taken into account when measuring currency outflows. The central bank drained funds for a fifth day in open-market operations, pulling 145 billion yuan ($21.4 billion) from the financial system on Tuesday, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The overnight repurchase rate, a gauge of interbank funding availability, snapped a six-day decline, advancing three basis points to 2.11 percent, weighted average prices show. The yield on government bonds due in a decade was little changed at 2.77 percent, according to National Interbank Funding Center prices. — With assistance by Tian Chen, and Helen Sun"

One good way to charge for your product, if you can get away with it, is to charge your customer whatever it cost you to manufacture, plus a little something for profit. Here's an excerpt from Gavin Finch and Liam Vaughan's forthcoming Libor scandal book, ""The Fix,"" describing the 1969 invention of Libor by Manufacturers Hanover banker Minos Zombanakis as a way to make floating-rate syndicated loans: So the original point of Libor was as a way for banks to make guaranteed profits on their loans. (I mean, except for credit risk, etc.) All of the risks of the bank's funding costs -- not just the risks due to general interest-rate conditions, but even the risks due to the bank's own recklessness -- were passed on to the borrower. (Only on average -- if one bank was reckless and had to pay more than the others to borrow, it could only recoup a portion of that cost -- but still.) Why wouldn't you expect the banks to game that? The way ur-Libor worked is: You had some banks, and they loaned a company some money, and every quarter the banks would go to the company and say ""it cost us X to borrow, so please pay us X + 2 percent"" or whatever. ""Soon the rate was adopted by bankers outside the loan market who were looking for an ­elegant proxy for bank borrowing costs that was simple, fair, and appeared to be independent."" But how on earth did it appear to be independent? It was the banks making up a number and then getting paid that number. Obviously they'd want to make up a higher number! Anyway, then Libor became the reference rate for interest-rate swaps and everything else, even though it was still just banks making up some numbers: One contrarian thing that I sometimes think about the big Libor scandal is that you can analyze it as a weird market. Some traders at some banks had interest-rate swaps that would profit if Libor was higher, so they pressured their Libor submitters to make up a higher Libor. Other traders at other banks had the other sides of those swaps, so they pressured their submitters to make up a lower Libor. The Libor rate that was ultimately set represented sort of a phantom clearing price for interest-rate derivatives; it may not have been a fair representation of banks' borrowing costs, but it was an imperfect approximate result of market forces.  But notice that that only works if Libor is the reference rate for trillions of dollars of swaps with Libor-panel banks on both sides of them. If Libor was only used to set pricing on syndicated loans -- its original purpose -- then banks would only ever have an incentive to make it higher. The higher the Libor, the higher the rate the banks can charge. But once it was the underlying interest rate for all sorts of instruments, the incentives are not so obvious and one-way, and some banks might push against others and end up with a fair-ish result. In a way, Libor's shabby initial construction was better suited to its ultimate dominance than it was to its original purpose. Maybe mutual funds aren't all bad. We've talked a lot recently about the theory that index funds and other broadly diversified mutual funds might cause antitrust problems. The theory is that if Company A and Company B have a lot of the same shareholders, then those shareholders won't want Company A to do anything to hurt Company B, or vice versa. If Company A and Company B are competitors, then the shareholders won't want one of them to slash prices to gain market share: High industry-wide profits are what the shareholders want, and they're indifferent to which particular company earns them, so they won't want fierce competition. A lot of people are skeptical about this theory, mainly because they don't believe that diversified institutional shareholders really influence companies in this way. Sure! But let's leave that aside for a minute. Let's assume that the theory is true and that there is some mechanism by which diversified shareholders push managers of Company A and Company B to cooperate with each other for their mutual good. If Company A and Company B are competitors, that is bad.  But what if they're not? Here's a paper from Kayla Freeman at Indiana University about cross-ownership and vertical (customer/supplier) relationships: I guess that is good? Freeman does ""not directly address this question empirically,"" but notes that ""theory and empirical findings from a host of prior studies provide strong evidence that customer-supplier collaboration is value-enhancing."" Also: I realize that people will still find this story a bit far-fetched. It's hard to imagine Vanguard Group showing up at the offices of a manufacturer and strong-arming it into buying parts from another company where Vanguard is a shareholder. The mechanism for all of this stuff still seems a bit vague. But isn't it such a good story? It's a story about how all big public companies, in some approximate sense, approach being a single company, through the mechanism of diversified institutional investors. There is a set of things that are Good For Big Business as a whole, and each big business works to achieve those things, even if they're not in its individual self-interest, because the dominant shareholder class that owns all the big businesses subtly but inexorably imposes its will on them all. There is a secret group of Illuminati who control all of the world's big companies, and who coordinate those companies' activities. But it's not, like, six guys in a smoke-filled room. It's much more diffuse and abstract than that. You can never directly observe that group exercising its power; you can only catch glimpses of it in statistical analyses of data. But if you believe that it exists, the financial world is a more enchanted place. Mnuchin! Speaking of Illuminati, I said this two weeks ago: Nothing much has changed, except that Ross will apparently be Trump's commerce secretary, and Mnuchin will apparently be Treasury secretary. What does Mnuchin's appointment mean? It's hard to say: Like so much of Trump's campaign and transition, Mnuchin is a blank slate for the projection of your hopes and fears. Here are his views, from an August profile by Max Abelson and Zachary Mider: Andrew Ross Sorkin says that Mnuchin is expected to be ""one of the adults in the administration,"" and quotes Henry Paulson calling him ""an excellent choice."" If there's one thing that you can tell about Mnuchin's views from his background, it's that he's a trader: It feels like that could be a motto for the Trump administration generally.  Elsewhere in Trump and economic policy: ""Trump Notches a Win as Carrier Agrees to Keep 1,000 Jobs in U.S."" Here at Bloomberg View, Tyler Cowen worries that Trump's focus on preventing jobs from moving to Mexico could lead to capital controls in which ""every capital transfer decision would be subject to the arbitrary diktats of politicians and bureaucrats."" And: ""Bill Walton, Old Einhorn Enemy, Makes a Comeback With Trump Role."" And: ""Donald Trump, the First President of Our Post-Literate Age."" And what do Wharton kids think about Trump? Bridgewater. Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund, is pretty into Transcendental Meditation, but I find that just reading its press statements puts me in a meditative place. This is lovely: That soothing roll of nonsense syllables: It would make a great mantra. You know my theory is that Bridgewater is run by computers, and it does sound a little like the computers have been writing the statements. Anyway Bridgewater settled a National Labor Relations Board action over some of the confidentiality provisions in its employment agreements, but delightfully, most of the details of the settlement are confidential. Bridgewater's sense of whimsy is contagious, and even the NLRB apparently got caught up in it. Blockchain blockchain blockchain. Okay sure: You know what else could be a digital record certifying ownership of gold at a secure bullion vault run by The Royal Mint? A list. The Royal Mint could have a list of people to whom it owes gold, and then when those people show up, it could give them the gold. And when you agree on a trade on the CME, instead of updating a distributed cryptographic ledger kept by multiple parties, the CME could just update The Royal Mint's list. Ah, but you see, what if people don't trust The Royal Mint to keep the list? The advantage of using a blockchain is that it avoids the need for a trusted intermediary: The record of ownership and transactions is kept, cryptographically, by all the participants in the market, rather than relying on a central counterparty to keep the record. Fine! But you know what else The Royal Mint keeps? The gold. If you don't trust The Royal Mint to keep the list of gold owners, why do you trust it to keep the gold? Elsewhere in blockchain: ""Has the blockchain hype finally peaked?"" And elsewhere in physical gold, a man stole an 86-pound bucket of gold flakes worth $1.6 million off the back of an armored truck in Midtown Manhattan, and walked away very slowly. People are worried about unicorns. Is Uber a car service, or an app that connects independent car drivers with passengers? I actually think that this is a fundamentally uninteresting question, and all the passion expended on it leaves me a bit cold. Uber is a specific set of facts -- the app, the relationships, the nuanced power dynamics among the company and the drivers and the passengers -- and there is no deep reason to categorize those facts as all-app or all-service. But oh man is that not legal advice. Because it is an important legal question, boring though it is, and the European Court of Justice is now considering it, with potentially big consequences: If you don't get too hung up on the categorization stuff, you might ask more useful policy questions like ""is Uber good for people"" or ""is this the sort of society we want to have"" or whatever. I suppose you can smuggle those questions into the service-or-app discussion too, but it always seems a bit fake. You're not going to find a magic proof that Uber drivers are really employees, or really contractors, or whatever, that will obviate all the bigger questions.  Elsewhere here's Golden State Warriors player Andre Iguodala on what moving to the Enchanted Forest did for his investment strategy: People are not worried about bond market liquidity anymore, it's all better now, congratulations everyone! Attentive readers may have noticed that, every day for at least the last year and a half, this newsletter has mentioned that ""people are worried about bond market liquidity."" Rain or shine, we get a little bond market liquidity, but I have to say that it's more shine than rain. When bond markets are serene, people are worried about bond market liquidity: They fear that, in a crunch, they won't be able to sell bonds, and the results will be a systemic crisis. But whenever there is a crunch, when bond prices move rapidly, people stop worrying about bond market liquidity. They are too busy selling their bonds to worry about being unable to sell their bonds. There's been a crunch recently. Here's Bloomberg Gadfly's Lisa Abramowicz: But, as she points out, this bond rout occurred on high volumes, and with ""a healthy two-sided market."" Expectations changed, and people wanted to sell, and prices adjusted, and people bought. It looked ... kind of like a market? Sure it is no longer a market that is intermediated through huge dealer balance sheets, and there will be hiccups and volatility and maybe the odd run on a bond mutual fund. But the systemic disaster that people keep expecting keeps not arriving. Abramowicz has been writing about bond market liquidity far longer than I have, and if she has concluded that we don't need to worry about bond market liquidity anymore, that is good enough for me. Also I am super bored by it to be honest? I now declare this section non-mandatory. If people are actually worrying about bond market liquidity, I'll write about it. But I'm going to stop scraping Google for Maltese fund managers who might mention the word ""liquidity."" Bye! Things happen. RBS Fails Toughest-Ever BOE Stress Test, Boosts Capital Plan.

2016-12-08T12:00:04.709Z,What Happened to the Financial Blockchain Revolution,"Elaine Ou
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-08/what-happened-to-the-financial-blockchain-revolution,"Once upon a time, there was a lot of optimism that the blockchain -- the technology underlying Bitcoin -- would help the finance industry deal with a big headache: post-trade processing, the often long and arduous task of making sure money and securities change hands and everybody knows who owes what to whom. The problem might yet get solved, but it probably won’t come as a revolution. The industry’s main effort to bend the technology to its will -- the R3 consortium -- recently saw the departure of several banks, including founding members Goldman Sachs and Banco Santander, and reportedly reduced its fundraising target. Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, explained that initial expectations were unreasonably high, blaming the ""hype cycle"" on tech firms and their dreams of disruption. Now, R3 has unveiled its new platform: Corda, a decentralized database that does not use a blockchain, as its technical white paper specifically points out. In a blog post, R3 architecture consultant Ian Grigg argues that Corda will become a formidable opponent to the two most popular blockchain technologies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, because it is the only solution that ""asked the users what they want."" QuickTake Bitcoin and the Blockchain Okay, so the problem this whole time was that Bitcoin’s anonymous creator neglected to ask financial institutions what they wanted? Bitcoin was created as an alternative to banks, not a solution for them. By contrast, plenty of blockchain-inspired ventures -- such as Digital Asset Holdings, Blockchain Insurance Industry Initiative, and Japan Exchange Group -- have focused precisely on figuring out what financial customers want. It turns out that using blockchain terminology is a good way to get customers interested. Corda, for example, offers oracles and notaries and smart contracts -- features that in existing systems have boring names such as data feeds, central counterparties and automated reconciliation tools. Post-trade processing is a multi-billion dollar industry, and it would be silly to think that financial technology providers somehow overlooked this opportunity for years. There are plenty of enterprise software vendors angling to serve this market, and financial institutions aren’t suffering from a lack of technology so much as an excess of complexity. Consider the market for syndicated loans, often cited as low-hanging fruit for blockchain disruption due to the lack of a central clearing authority and settlement times that can often exceed 20 days. Despite the fact that automated settlement technology is already available, the largest participants have yet to integrate their systems with the new platforms. Regulation is one complicating factor. Reforms since the financial crisis have forced banks to rush infrastructure changes, leading to fragmentation of market practice and potential fragility. As a recent ISDA whitepaper puts it: What a mess. In theory, distributed ledger technology could streamline the entire transaction process, from pre-trade to execution to regulatory reporting. But how do you accomplish such a rollout without bulldozing everything to the ground? It’s really hard to retire legacy infrastructure without disrupting the delicately balanced systems that have been evolving for decades. It’s tempting to imagine that technology alone can revolutionize the banking industry. After all, decentralized blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum seem to replicate global financial infrastructure with ease. Yet such self-governing structures work in part because they don’t have to be shoehorned into existing bureaucracies. Hence, all the blockchain hype might ultimately do little more than pressure financial institutions into meaningful collaboration. Change will probably be slow and cautious, but in this industry that’s considered a good thing.

2017-01-09T11:01:39.554Z,Five Things You Need to Know to Start Your Day,"Lorcan Roche Kelly
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/pound-falls-yuan-volatility-and-fed-hawks-line-up-what-people-are-talking-about,"Want to receive this post in your inbox every morning? Sign up here. The pound drops, the yuan falls, and Fed hawks circle. Here are some of the things people in markets are talking about today. The British pound was trading 1.1 percent lower at $1.2148 as of 4:55 a.m. ET following comments over the weekend from Prime Minister Theresa May which stoked fears that the U.K. will lose access to Europe's single market. In an interview with Sky News she said that regaining control of immigration and lawmaking are a greater priority than membership of the single market. Meanwhile, data from Halifax this morning showed U.K. home prices had a strong end to 2016, but the U.K. mortgage lender warned growth is likely to slow in 2017. The Chinese currency's lively start to the year continued overnight, with the offshore yuan dropping 0.4 percent by 5:20 a.m. ET, adding to a 0.9 percent fall on Friday. Last week, a short squeeze helped the currency to a record weekly advance. Over the weekend, the People’s Bank of China revealed that the country's foreign reserve holdings fell for a sixth month in December to $3.01 trillion, down from a record $4 trillion in June 2014. Fan Gang, an adviser to the People's Bank of China, said that additional measures to stem capital outflows are unlikely. With just over a year remaining on Janet Yellen's current term as chair of the Federal Reserve, comments from three of her potential successors at this this weekend's annual American Economic Association meeting are noteworthy. Glenn Hubbard of Columbia University, along with Stanford University’s John Taylor and Kevin Warsh, are all seen by Fed watchers as potential future chairs should President-elect Donald Trump decide not to re-nominate Yellen. All three criticized the U.S. central bank for trying to do too much, and suggested interest rates would be higher if they were in charge. Overnight, the MSCI Asia Pacific excluding Japan Index gained 0.1 percent, with Japanese markets closed for a holiday. In Europe, the Stoxx 600 Index was 0.4 percent lower at 5:22 a.m. ET while U.K. stocks traded higher as the pound fell. S&P 500 futures dropped 0.1 percent. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is in Washington this week as the U.K. seeks to strengthen ties with the incoming administration. The president-elect tweeted yesterday that he is looking forward to meeting Theresa May following his inauguration. Meanwhile, speculation is mounting that the PEOTUS will follow through on threats to label China a currency manipulator at the new review in April, despite the country only meeting one of the three criteria specified by the Obama administration.  This is what's caught our eye over the weekend."
2016-12-23T07:35:37.679Z,"Bitcoin Surges Above $900 on Geopolitical Risks, Fed Tightening","Justina Lee
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-23/bitcoin-surges-above-900-on-geopolitical-risks-fed-tightening,"Bitcoin headed for its biggest weekly jump since June as rising geopolitical risks boosted demand for alternative assets. The cryptocurrency surged 15 percent this week to $900.40 as of 2:38 p.m. in Hong Kong, taking its gain this year to 107 percent, data compiled by Bloomberg show. The last time it was at such levels was in January 2014, when bitcoin was tumbling from its record price of $1,137 following the implosion of the MtGox exchange and tightening Chinese controls. Bitcoin is extending a rally that’s beaten every major currency, stock index and commodity contract in 2016. Buyers sought alternative assets this week amid the killing of Russia’s envoy to Turkey and a separate attack that left 12 people dead in Berlin. Weakening pressure on the yuan, which intensified this month as the U.S. projected a faster pace of tightening next year following Donald Trump’s election win, is also increasing demand for bitcoin in China, where the majority of trading occurs.   “Terrorist attacks in Europe boosted haven demand in capital markets, and gold has been falling since Trump was elected,” said Le Xiaotian, an analyst at Huobi, a Chinese exchange. “Global instability has to a large extent directed funds to the bitcoin market.” Bitcoin, which trades in cyberspace and is mined by code-cracking computers, is gaining popularity among some investors as an alternative safe haven because it’s deemed to be less influenced by government regulations and changes to monetary policy. Gold, which tends to trade in tandem with bitcoin when haven demand is strong, has fallen this quarter as U.S. rates rise, narrowing its premium over bitcoin to the least in three years. “The Fed’s rate hike announcement has probably spooked a lot of emerging-market investors, particularly those in China, who are now flocking to bitcoin as a refuge from weak fiat currency assets,” said Thomas Glucksmann, head of marketing at Gatecoin Ltd. in Hong Kong. “As we’ve passed the $800 bitcoin price, a strong resistance point in the past, and move closer towards the psychological $1000 stratosphere, anything seems possible.” — With assistance by Darren Boey"
2017-01-17T14:24:35.454Z,Snap Votes and Banker Bonuses,"Matt Levine
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2017-01-17/snap-votes-and-banker-bonuses,"Disappearing votes. There is a bit of a tradition of initial public offerings by hot internet companies where the founders sell stock to the public but keep control for themselves by setting up dual-class share structures and giving themselves high-voting shares. But then later they realize that they haven't given themselves enough votes -- if they issue new stock for acquisitions, or sell some of their stock for philanthropic purposes, then they'll lose control of their companies --- and so they have to sort of shamefacedly creep back to the shareholders and say ""hey would you mind giving us even more votes?"" It's fine, really -- the founders control the company, so what are the shareholders going to do, say no? -- but it's a little awkward. People complain. You end up with triple-class stock. It all looks a little dumb. There is absolutely no need to do it like that. Founders could just give themselves total permanent control at the time of the IPO: Instead of giving themselves 10-vote shares and the public 1-vote shares, or whatever, they can give themselves 10-vote shares and the public zero-vote shares. Then they never need to go back to the public shareholders to ask them to approve a new share class, or anything else. The founders can just run the company however they want, and public shareholders will be limited to putting up cash and hoping for the best. Snap Inc. is apparently planning to do it the right way: I appreciate their tidy-mindedness, which is not particularly evident in their app's user interface. (The other 30 percent of the voting power will apparently go to other pre-IPO investors.)  There is the usual guff about shareholder rights (""Some big investors contend that dual-class structures unfairly remove public shareholders from the decision-making process""), and about Snap's ability to impose this structure despite that pushback (""If you’re the only supply in the market, you’re well positioned to dictate the terms""), all of which feels a bit unreal. No one cares about this stuff. I mean, people care: Journalists and academics and governance experts love to talk about how bad dual-class share structures are. But in financial markets, there is only one meaningful way to care, and that is in price. If IPOs with dual-class shares came at a discount to IPOs with full shareholder rights, then this would matter. Bankers would go to founders and say: Look, you can keep control of your company by selling zero-vote shares to the public, but you'll raise less money than you would by selling full-vote shares. And the founders would have to make an economic decision about what they value -- informed by the fact that investors made an economic decision about what they value. But these are clearly not conversations that founders are having, and there's not much evidence of a price discount for dual-class IPOs. (""The difference in post-IPO performance between dual-class companies and non-dual-class companies isn’t statistically significant, both among tech companies and all U.S. listings."") Some people might care about dual-class stock, but the people actually buying the stock don't care enough to pay less for it, meaning that in a practical sense no one cares. One way to think about this is: Look, there is nothing particularly magical about voting stock. Companies raise money in lots of different ways, and those ways give investors different rights. Bond investors usually don't get to vote on directors or mergers. Stock investors usually do. Snap stock investors ... won't. Voting for directors is one way that stock investors traditionally protect their investments, but there are other ways to protect your investment, and Snap investors might be reasonably confident that they'll get a good return even without that traditional protection. Another way to think about it, though, is that no one cares because no one has ever had any reason to care. (Or at least not recently, and memories are short.) The high-profile Internet companies with the most egregious share structures -- Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc., which both went public as dual-class companies and then added a third class to cement founder control -- have made massive piles of money for their shareholders and are still run by active visionary founders who are liked by their investors. Eventually some tech founder will do some awful self-dealing, and investors will complain, but he'll get away with it because his dual-class stock allows him to ignore investors, so they will take their pique out on the next tech company that tries to go public with dual-class stock. (This happens in the bond market every now and then.) On the other hand, though, I don't know; people complained a lot when Elon Musk wanted to merge Tesla Motors Inc. and SolarCity Corp., and he was able to do it anyway, and they didn't have dual-class stock. Visionary founders can get away with a lot, whatever the corporate-governance formalities say. Elsewhere: The corporate governance business is dominated by women. (""But when we are hiring, we need to really push that diversity to make sure we have men on the slate."") Disappearing bonuses. During and after the financial crisis of 2007-2008, bankers' bonuses became a focus of public attention, and there was a lot of very heated and very boring debate about them. It went something like this: Do you remember when the U.S. Congress almost imposed a 90 percent retroactive tax on bankers' bonuses? I do! (It was of some personal interest to me, at the time.) It is easy enough to understand that a money-losing company would still need to pay its employees' salaries, but people just could not get their heads around the idea that a money-losing company might also pay bonuses. The 90 percent tax thing never happened, but the European Union really did cap bonuses at two times base salaries just because it felt like bonuses shouldn't be that big. Anyway time and economics seem to have resolved the misunderstanding: If you only give a bonus to the top 10 percent of your employees, then it is a bonus all right! That fits pretty well with the popular understanding. Next year maybe Deutsche will pay its bonuses in the form of $100 Starbucks gift cards, and the popular and bank conceptions of ""bonus"" will converge entirely, at least at Deutsche Bank. I have always been pretty skeptical about restrictions on banker bonuses. They seem to rest on arithmetic errors; paying someone a $1 million base salary and a $1 million bonus is in many ways riskier for the bank than paying her a $200,000 base and a $1.8 million bonus. But if banking bonuses become exceptional rewards for a job well done, and if most bank employees expect to get them rarely or never, then that really will change banks' culture. People talk about making banking boring again, and taking away bonuses will make it very boring indeed. If that's what you want! Meanwhile, in any other context you'd probably be annoyed by this: But now it's like: Bitcoin HFT! I assume the Venn diagram of ""people who invest in bitcoin"" and ""people who think that the financial system is rigged against them because high-frequency traders are allowed to co-locate their servers and front-run ordinary investors"" has a lot of overlap, so what about this, huh? Also I am going to go out on a limb here and guess that the risk of adverse selection in the bitcoin market is somewhat lower than it is in, say, the U.S. stock market. You're not trading against Fidelity here, you know? The basic raison d'être of high-frequency trading is that it makes markets more efficient, and that's not just a matter of enforcing the law of one price by arbitraging bitcoin prices across multiple platforms. It's also about efficiently extracting value from amateur noise traders and giving it to professionals.  Pound flash crash. Here is a Bank for International Settlements report on ""The sterling 'flash event' of 7 October 2016."" In the BIS's telling, it was the standard feedback loop of any market crash: Some people wanted to sell pounds, so the price of the pound declined, which led to further selling to hedge option positions, so the price declined some more, and stop-loss orders were triggered, leading to even more selling. ""The presence, outside the currency’s core time zone, of staff less experienced in trading sterling, with lower risk limits and risk appetite, and with less expertise in the suitability of particular algorithms for the prevailing market conditions, appears to have further amplified the movement."" Also: At the same time it's not as simple as saying ""high-frequency electronic trading causes instability"": The story is that the price dropped, so some traders stopped trading, which made liquidity worse, and then later they started trading again, which made it better. Some of that trading was electronic, and some of it wasn't, but there's no tight connection between electronic trading and withdrawal of liquidity. Fiduciaries. One basic problem with regulation is that you probably want some good thing, so you make a rule saying ""there shall be the good thing,"" but the rule doesn't just magically create the good thing. Instead, it creates an enforcement mechanism. The enforcement mechanism may tend to create more of the good thing, but enforcement mechanisms in themselves are sort of necessarily bad. They're coercive, they're punitive, they're bureaucratic, they're inflexible, etc. You can't create rules just because you want the good thing; you have to also want the enforcement mechanism. If you forget this, you get terrible consequences. So you don't like drug addiction, so you say ""there shall be no drugs,"" and you get mass incarceration. (And still drug addiction!)  Anyway here is Cliff Asness on the Labor Department's fiduciary rule: The point is that it would definitely be good if financial advisers acted in their clients' best interests, but you can't just decree that that will happen. All you can do is create an enforcement mechanism -- regulatory penalties and/or private lawsuits for advisers who don't act in their clients' best interests -- and that mechanism will not correspond precisely to the good thing that you want. What is Bernie Madoff up to? This is so perfect that I can't quite believe it: I like that Bernie Madoff is enjoying prison so much because it allows him to be his true self. All those years, he was a massive crook, but had to go around pretending to be an upstanding businessman. Now, behind bars, he is finally free to let his crook flag fly.  People are worried about unicorns. As far as I can tell the list of top worries about unicorns goes something like this: ""For $8,000 this startup will fill your veins with the blood of young people,"" says this article, and this is not the first time we have talked about vampirism in the tech world. In addition to being an excellent plot for a television thriller, it is a lovely parable of Silicon Valley. The blood startup is called Ambrosia, and while it has some vague basis in medical research (it ""was inspired by studies on mice that researchers had sewn together, with their veins conjoined, in a procedure called parabiosis""), its clear inspiration is not science but myth, an atavistic throwback to magical notions of preserving eternal youth through vampirism. Nerd culture is about fantasy and science fiction, not science, which is why unicorns are called unicorns. And remember what Marx said. Elsewhere, Peter Thiel might run for governor of California in 2018, presumably on an ""I will drink your blood, you delicious young bags of meat"" platform. And Silicon Valley is moving to the right politically. People are worried about bond market liquidity. Well you know the problem: And here is the solution: I mean, it's a solution. Citadel is sort of the plug in solving problems about bond trading: If market-making is an economically useful function, and if banks should not be in the market-making business, then Citadel should probably do more market-making.

2017-01-19T02:39:07.482Z,Stemming the Tide: Six Things China Can Do Next to Curb Outflows,"Justina Lee
        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-19/china-s-remaining-weapons-in-capital-outflow-fight-bitcoin-art,"As cash continues to flood out of China, expectations are growing that the authorities will erect higher barriers. With the nation’s capital outflows last year estimated at $728 billion by Standard Chartered Plc, and the yuan predicted to continue declining against the dollar in 2017, analysts have been casting forward to what the authorities may do next to stop funds from fleeing. QuickTake What's Causing Those Capital Outflows From China Recent measures include restrictions on buying insurance products in Hong Kong, limiting overseas acquisitions and investments, and demanding more details from citizens when converting their annual quota into foreign exchange.   China’s currency regulator says such steps have been taken to strengthen existing policies, and don’t equate to capital curbs. ""China will not return to walking the old path of using capital controls under a planned economy,"" the State Administration of Foreign Exchange said in e-mailed comments on Wednesday. SAFE will evaluate plans to deal with capital flows “prudently” before implementing them, a regulatory official said at a briefing on Thursday, without giving details. Here’s what analysts say China may do next: The government may cap UnionPay credit-card spending by its citizens abroad on high-value products such as art and antiques, said Robin Xing, chief China economist at Morgan Stanley. Chinese buyers helped push up prices at auctions in recent years. Billionaire Liu Yiqian used his American Express card to pay the $45 million bill for a 15th century Tibetan embroidered silk thangka last year. The biggest move authorities can make would be to force exporters to sell their foreign-exchange proceeds, said Brad Setser, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York and a former U.S. Treasury Department official. Such a step would help tackle one of the key sources of the yuan’s weakness. Chinese exporters converted the equivalent of 56 percent of their overseas revenues into yuan in November, compared with a monthly average of 71 percent in the four years through 2013, when the currency was gaining. A measure like this would require outflows to pick up significantly, since it could disrupt trade, said Harrison Hu, chief greater China economist at Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc. It would be ""a move backward from the vision of a China that’s more seamlessly integrated into the global financial system,” Setser said. What’s causing those capital outflows: QuickTake Q&A The currency regulator said in March last year China was considering imposing a tax on foreign-exchange trading to limit capital outflows. The nation’s central bank has already drafted rules for such a measure, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg News that same month. A so-called Tobin tax would complicate plans by China to boost the yuan’s global role and could undermine the leadership’s pledge to increase the role of market forces in the world’s second-largest economy. The Tobin tax takes its name from U.S. economist James Tobin, who in 1972 suggested taking a cut of foreign-exchange trades to limit currency speculation. History is littered with government attempts to extract revenue from financial transactions, not all of which were successful and most of which had unintended consequences. Chinese investors increasingly turned to the cryptocurrency to hedge against the weakening yuan and take cash out of the nation, helping bitcoin rally to beat every major currency, stock index and commodity contract in 2016. While the $14 billion total value of bitcoin makes it minor relative to most asset classes, it’s sensitive to any moves by China to curb trading. Bitcoin has tumbled 6.1 percent this year after central bank officials visited exchanges and warned investors about the dangers of trading the asset. Policy makers are likely to require more reporting from bitcoin exchanges and incorporate their flows into the monitoring of citizens’ annual $50,000 quota to buy foreign exchange, said Zennon Kapron, managing director of Shanghai-based consulting firm Kapronasia. China’s cash exodus has been partly driven by an increase in financial institutions’ overseas assets. Outflows via loans rose to $37.2 billion in the third quarter, near a record in balance of payments data going back to 1998. Policy makers can probably discourage state banks from building up foreign assets, and may have done so last quarter, said CFR’s Setser. The central bank also plans to encourage lenders to issue more dollar-dominated debt offshore, Bloomberg News reported this month. Banks can convert such funds raised overseas into yuan with the People’s Bank of China, helping to boost the central bank’s foreign-currency reserves. Luring more foreign funds into China would obviously help counter outflows. In particular, Chinese officials have been courting compilers of global stock and bond indexes, such as MSCI Inc., to get the country’s assets included. Such acceptance would be a coup: HSBC Holdings Plc estimated that inclusion in major bond measures could help draw as much as $150 billion to Chinese government debt, and a probable $30 billion if shares were added to MSCI gauges. Ironically, it’s China’s limits on the freedom to withdraw money from the country that discourages inflows. MSCI cited restrictions when it decided against adding Chinese shares to its global indexes in June, saying the limits remain a “significant hurdle” for investors. All these measures aside, as long as Chinese financial markets remain weak and monetary policy continues to diverge with the U.S.’s, money is likely to keep exiting the nation. “Capital-control measures can help mitigate the pace of capital outflows in the short term,” said Morgan Stanley’s Xing. “However, the fundamental factors behind the outflow -- decline in investment returns in China and a continued slippage in interest-rate gaps between China and the U.S. -- have remained in place and will likely keep capital outflow pressures alive in the medium term.” — With assistance by Tian Chen"

        ",https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2016-12-05/votes-mortgages-and-mackerel,"Italy. The recurring story of Western democracies in 2016 has been one of elites asking the people to weigh in on subtle and complex structural issues in the form of a wildly oversimplified binary question, and the people giving the ""wrong"" answer, and then everyone trying to figure out what that means. Brexit means Brexit, but is it a hard Brexit or a soft Brexit or what? Donald Trump will be the president, but will he be populist Trump or Secret Trump or Wall Street Trump or what? And this weekend Italy held a constitutional referendum to reduce bicameralism in its legislature and centralize some government functions in Rome, and the people voted no, and so is that going to be a ... hard bicameralism? Or what? I don't know; as in most of these things, the symbolism of the vote seems almost unrelated to its practical consequences. Or, well, one practical consequence seems to have mattered: Prime Minister Matteo Renzi said he would resign if the referendum failed, and it did, so he did.  ""In Italian politics, no one ever wins,"" said Renzi, and he could have left out the ""Italian."" But while the voters rejected Renzi, it's not clear what they chose instead; Alberto Mingardi writes that ""a big problem now is that a 'no' side just doesn't exist."" As for economic consequences, it is still early days. European stocks were up, as ""investors had widely anticipated the result of Sunday’s referendum and subsequent resignation of Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, and consequently sold Italian equities, bonds and the euro in the weeks leading up to the vote."" The euro also rebounded quickly. Monte dei Paschi di Siena's recapitalization plan is in trouble, though, and it's not great news for any Italian banks really. Fannie and Freddie. Here is a syllogism: I read this argument about once a week, and it makes me run around screaming and punching walls. How could anyone believe it? Taking all the money now and maybe having to give back some of it later seems strictly better, as a matter of arithmetic, than giving all of it away now. I say this all the time, but I cannot get anyone to believe me. It is one of my greatest professional frustrations. Anyway here is Gretchen Morgenson: Right but see ... oh, never mind. Elsewhere, Bill Ackman is down only about 10 percent this year, instead of 20 percent, because of the Fannie and Freddie rally. Cellblockchain! Poor Charlie Shrem, the bitcoin-exchange operator who was sent to prison for selling bitcoins for drug trafficking on Silk Road, learned exactly the lesson you'd expect from his experience: Yes, it's easy! If you want to buy something from me, instead of just handing me a can of mackerel (the main currency in federal prison), you can just instruct a dozen other people to transfer one mackcoin from your account to mine, and they can update their decentralized ledgers. Which they keep on paper. In their cells. Obviously the transaction will be delayed if the cells are, you know, locked. But assuming you can move freely around the federal prison -- why not? -- to discuss the transaction with a dozen other inmates, the only issue that remains is for them to cryptographically verify the transaction. Instead of lifting weights out in the yard, the new generation of inmates will spend their time factoring large numbers on scraps of toilet paper. I kid, but eventually the prison system really will build up a critical mass of bitcoin drug dealers and money launderers (and Ethereum pyramid schemers and hackers), and they can build their own prison economy based around the blockchain and use it to steal from one another. Loss enhancement. We talked a couple of weeks ago about my pet theory that there really isn't any white-collar law: You could imagine some sort of legislative scaling of culpability, where intentionally lying to steal money for your personal use is punished more harshly than, say, unknowingly trading on a third-hand insider stock tip, or following generally accepted accounting principles and the advice of your auditors in a way that nonetheless paints a misleading picture of your company's financial position, or whatever. You'd make a list of which actions and intentions and harms are morally bad, and which are less bad, and punish the worse ones more. Instead it is only a small exaggeration to say that there is just one big lumpy crime -- fraud -- and that punishments are scaled by dollar amounts under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. So there's basic fraud, which will generally get you probation; there's million-dollar fraud, which might get you three years in prison; and there's billion-dollar fraud, which might get you 20 years. And yet billion-dollar fraud is less likely to be venal and intentional than million-dollar fraud. You can just go steal a million dollars. It's hard to steal a billion dollars, though Bernie Madoff did it. Most of the billion-dollar stuff is squishy, executives bending the rules to keep their companies afloat rather than thieves directly lying to pocket money for themselves.  Anyway here are Douglas Berman, and Stephanie Teplin and Harry Sandick, on a recent federal appellate court decision (in a food-stamp fraud case) finding ""that the outsize effect of the loss amount enhancement on the defendant’s base offense level—a sentencing scheme for fraud that is 'unknown to other sentencing systems'—required the district court to reconsider whether a non-Guidelines sentence was warranted."" That is: The court realized that sentencing white-collar crimes based mainly on dollar amounts is weird, and ""unknown to other sentencing systems,"" and it suggested that trial courts shouldn't feel themselves too bound by those dollar-amount guidelines.  Elsewhere in white-collar crime, United Continental Holdings, Inc., agreed to pay $2.4 million to settle a Securities and Exchange Commission case over the time that it bribed the chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey by reinstating a money-losing flight to South Carolina that he liked to take. What's the moral culpability of that, I wonder. The SEC got United for failing ""to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the issuer."" I feel like that does not accurately and fairly reflect what went on here. Information and shadow banking. Here are a blog post and related paper by Kathryn Judge of Columbia Law School about runs in the shadow banking system. Judge contrasts the regulation of capital markets, which rely on disclosure and expect investors to understand what they're buying, and the regulation of banks, which issue information-insensitive money claims (deposits, etc.) but which are prudentially regulated to make sure those claims are good. In capital markets, investors know what they're buying; in banks, they don't, but the banks and regulators do. The issue with shadow banking is that no one knows what the investors are buying: There is a story of the 2008 financial crisis that is all about information asymmetry: Banks made loans that they knew were bad, and packaged and sold them to investors, and the investors were deceived by the evil banks. But that story can't be entirely right; after all, the banks ended up holding a lot of exposure to those bad loans. (If they'd sold them all, it wouldn't have been a crisis for them!) A story of information gaps, in which the structure of the system results in no one having all the necessary information, seems to fit the facts better. Elsewhere in shadow banking, ""Investors Tiptoed Back Into Prime Money-Market Funds, Then Left."" And elsewhere in financial crisis retrospection, here are remarks on regulation since the crisis from William Dudley and Daniel Tarullo of the Federal Reserve.  Oh no. You know what E.B. White said about the frog, but there is something particularly embarrassing about reading how Wall Street research analysts inject personality into their notes: I am sure that in each case you had to be there. Well not the Biggie lyrics, you can probably guess those. ""It’s like the more money we come across/The more problems we see,"" Jalinoos quoted, about quantitative easing. That's a pretty convenient one. The ""money"" is right there in the lyric, and it is ... quantitative. Next analysts will be quoting Eagles lyrics about how ""you can check out any time you like, but you can never leave."" (That one's great if you're worried about bond market liquidity!) Analysts who prefer novels might notice that if they are writing about two things, Charles Dickens has already written a book about two things, and so they can freshen up their work and knowingly wink at his title by calling their note ""A Tale of Two Cross-Currency Bases"" or whatever. There are many other similar literary options, which I have collected here, and which are freely available to any analyst -- or journalist -- who'd like to use them.  People are worried about unicorns. This is from a while ago, but why not: ""Unicorns are Overrated. Triple Crowns are Better."" And those in Silicon Valley who are worried about Peter Thiel may not be reassured by his appearance at Robert Mercer's ""Villains and Heroes"" costume party: Donald Trump was also there: ""Asked what his costume was, he pointed at himself and mouthed 'me.'"" People are worried about stock buybacks. Donald Trump is going to get all the multinational companies to bring their money back to the U.S., where they'll use it for stock buybacks: If you worry about stock buybacks, you probably have some hierarchy of what companies are supposed to use money for. Paying wages, capital expenditures, research and development, etc., are all probably pretty high on the list, and stock buybacks are quite low. But ""leaving money in cash offshore to avoid paying taxes"" is also, I would bet, pretty low on the list. So even if you're a buyback worrier, you might be happy about this particular coming increase in buybacks. People are worried about bond market liquidity. I mean, I never said they weren't: Global bonds lost $1.7 trillion of value last month, with the Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Total Return Index showing its worst results since its inception in 1990. And that's ""mini-stress""! The real stress -- the one that will cause the bond-market liquidity worries to come true -- is forever in the future. Things happen.
