"July 25, 2017 /  8:56 PM / 10 hours ago",Wall Street regulator sets sights on digital coin offerings,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss & Anna Irrera,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-sec-digital-idUSKBN1AA2OL,"(Reuters) - Wall Street's main regulator said on Tuesday that initial coin offerings (ICOs), a means of crowdfunding for blockchain technology companies, should be subject to the same safeguards required in traditional securities sales.  ICOs have become a bonanza for digital currency entrepreneurs, allowing them to raise millions quickly by creating and selling digital ""tokens"" with no regulatory oversight.  But the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has said that the tokens can be considered securities, and therefore, may need to be registered unless a valid exemption applies.  ""The innovative technology behind these virtual transactions does not exempt securities offerings and trading platforms from the regulatory framework designed to protect investors and the integrity of the markets,"" said Stephanie Avakian, the co-director of the SEC's enforcement division.  The decision reminds blockchain startups that they cannot ignore investor protections, and could make some potentially more cautious about fundraising via coin sales in the United States.  By mid-July, tech firms raised about $1.1 billion in 89 coin sales this year, roughly 10 times more than that in the whole of 2016, according to data compiled for Reuters by crypto-currency research firm Smith + Crown.  And this year alone, there are 110 upcoming ICOS, according to tokendat.io, a website that tracks token sales.  ""This is a shot across the bow for many of these ICOs,"" said Preston Byrne, a technology attorney who specializes in virtual currencies. ""I think it ruins the party in the U.S. for sure.""  Some ICOs have drawn criticism because they failed to accurately disclose token distribution, such as what proportion of tokens would be held by founders or whether the offering would be capped.   As many of these tokens are then listed and traded on virtual currency exchanges, large holders could in theory have the firepower to control the price.   Critics have also warned that projects often lack realistic business plans or are being led by individuals who do not have enough experience.  The SEC's decision was released in an investigative report into a virtual organization known as The DAO. The DAO was created in April 2016 by a blockchain company called Slock.it.   A blockchain is an online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers, which gained prominence as the technology that underpinned digital currencies such as bitcoin.  The DAO was designed as a decentralized crowdfunding model in which anyone could contribute ethereum tokens to be a voting member and have an equity stake in the organization. Ethereum is another cryptocurrency.   Although it raised $150 million as of late May last year, an anonymous hacker later funneled $60 million of the tokens into a separate account.  The SEC said in its report it has decided not to bring civil charges at the end of its probe into The DAO, but instead use the case as a cautionary tale for the market. "

"July 25, 2017 /  11:12 PM / 14 hours ago",Investment in UK fintech tops pre-Brexit levels in first half of 2017,Jemima Kelly,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-britain-fintech-investment-idUSKBN1AA2VN,"LONDON (Reuters) - Over half a billion dollars were poured into British financial technology companies in the first half of 2017, over a third more than the same period last year, trade body Innovate Finance said on Wednesday, in the latest sign the fast-growing sector is so far weathering Brexit.   UK-based fintech startups pulled in $564 million of venture capital investment in the first six months of the year, more than half of which came from outside Britain.  That was up 37 percent from the first half of 2016, and put Britain in third place globally for fintech investment, behind the United States and China.  Some had worried that Britain's vote last June to leave the European Union would see Britain lose its status as the main European hub for fintech - a sector that ranges from mobile payment apps to digital currencies like bitcoin, and one that the government regards as a key source of economic growth.   The latest figures paint a promising picture, with investment up almost 50 percent on the second half of last year in the aftermath of the Brexit vote.  That still lags 2015, when a record $676 million was invested in the first half of the year and over $1.3 billion for the entire year. But from July 1 to July 23, the sector has already raised another $155 million.    ""We saw a period of uncertainty over the summer last year but I would say that by around the third quarter, things were starting to recover,"" Innovate Finance's chief financial officer, Abdul Haseeb Basit, told Reuters.   ""Things have slowed but we've seen an improving recovery since the referendum last year.""   The government has identified fintech as a priority area, saying it provides 60,000 jobs and contributes around $9 billion to the economy.   Basit said some deals had term sheets that included ""Brexit clauses"" - contractual provisions that meant investment was contingent on Britain voting to stay in the European Union - that had been triggered after the Brexit vote and meant funding had been pulled, causing concern.  But investors say Britain's prowess in both conventional finance and technology, as well as light-touch regulation, its pro-business culture and even the fact that it is Anglophone make it difficult for other centres to compete, though many - such as Berlin and Paris - are trying.  Basit said while passporting rights - which give firms licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other - had been a big concern for investors after Brexit, those worries had eased. Even if Britain loses passporting rights, that would affect only 20 percent of the almost 300 startups that are members of Innovate Finance.   More of a worry, he said, was that access to highly skilled workers would dry up when Britain leaves the EU. Innovate Finance has estimated 30 percent of the sector's workers are from overseas, mostly from the European Union.  ""Talent is the number one concern, and has been consistently since the referendum - we test (our members on) that every three to six months. So that's been fairly consistent - it's been a worry and until we have more certainty around that, it will remain a worry,"" he said.  Globally, fintech investment for the first half of the year stood at $6.5 billion. Just over half that went into U.S. startups and $1 billion into China.   That was down 45 percent from the same period last year, but Innovate Finance said that was largely because of three Chinese ""megadeals"" worth more than $1 billion each that had all gone through in early 2016.  A third of the investment into British fintech came from venture capital firms based in the United States.    ""There is a lot of competition in the investment space - there's a lot of capital available and it's looking for good companies to invest in,"" said Basit. ""Were they to not invest in UK companies, they feel like they might miss an opportunity. The appetite is still strong."" "

The license authorizes LedgerX to provide clearing services for fully collateralized digital currency swaps. LedgerX, which was also granted a license to operate as a swap execution facility early this month, initially plans to clear bitcoin options, the CFTC said in a statement.  The CFTC, however, also clarified in its statement that the approval of LedgerX's license ""does not constitute or imply a commission endorsement of the use of digital currency generally, or bitcoin specifically.""

Ethereum is another online public ledger much like bitcoin, but with self-executing transactions.  ""Having a regulated clearing house will open the market to a lot of other investors such as the large institutions,"" said Paul Chou, chief executive officer of LedgerX, in an interview.  ""A proper regulatory framework will open up the market and make them comfortable.""  The license took more than two years to win approval partly because of a long education process, said Chou, who also sits on the CFTC's Technology Advisory Committee.

""We are seeing strong demand from institutions that previously could not participate in the bitcoin market due to compliance restrictions against unregulated venues,"" said Chou.

"June 22, 2017 /  5:31 PM / 2 days ago",Fintech lingo explained,Anna Irrera & Maria Caspani,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-fintech-explainer-idUSKBN19D29I,"The world of financial technology — also known as fintech — involves lots of buzzwords, jargon and often obscure terminology.   Here's a list of some of the industry's main lingo.   FINTECH: Or financial technology is the industry known for championing software and technology in the financial sector. A very broad term, it includes anything from a bank ATM, to software used to help spot manipulation of securities markets.   CRYPTOCURRENCY: A digital currency that relies on cryptography to validate and secure transactions. There are different types of cryptocurrencies - bitcoin and Ether are among the best known.   BITCOIN: A digital - or crypto - currency that enables payment in a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) network not governed by any central authority or middleman.   BLOCKCHAIN: Software that first emerged as the system underpinning bitcoin. Also known as distributed ledger technology (DLT), it is a shared record of information that is maintained and updated by a network of computers rather than a central authority. It is protected and secured by advanced cryptography.   ETHEREUM: A type of blockchain network. The bitcoin and Ethereum blockchains differ primarily in purpose and capability. While the bitcoin blockchain is used to track ownership of the digital currency bitcoin, the Ethereum blockchain can be used to build decentralized applications. The virtual currency associated with Ethereum is called Ether.   P2P LENDING: Also known as social lending, peer-to-peer lenders run websites where borrowers can secure money directly from lenders bypassing banks.   SMART CONTRACTS: Software that runs on blockchain technology and can automatically enforce the terms of an agreement. A “smart bond”, for example would automatically make interest payments to investors.     ROBO-ADVICE: Financial advice given through the use of computer algorithms. Robo-advisors, also known as online investment managers, typically invest their clients’ money in portfolios made up of low cost exchange-traded funds.   INSURTECH: Inspired by the term fintech, insurtech champions the use of technology to modernize and improve the insurance business.   REGTECH: Or regulatory technology. The term refers to software and other technology aimed at helping financial services businesses comply with regulations efficiently and inexpensively, or regulators enforce rules.   OPEN BANKING: A term used to refer to the use of open APIs by banks to enable third party software developers to create applications and software using the bank’s data. APIs are application programming interfaces, a set of instructions and tools that enable software developers to create applications that can interact with another company’s systems. For example, by connecting to a bank’s API, a fintech startup could develop a mobile phone app that moves money in an out from the accounts of a bank’s customers, or simply lets them check their balance.   UNDERBANKED/UNBANKED: People or businesses that have little or no access to mainstream financial services. The World Bank estimates that there are 2 billion adults worldwide without access to formal financial services.   FINANCIAL INCLUSION: Term used to refer to financial products and services aimed at providing more affordable and mainstream options to the underbanked. In fintech, this often involves taking advantage of technology, such as mobile phones, to offer cheaper services to those who have been traditionally overlooked by banks and other financial firms.   ICO: Initial Coin Offering, or a token sale. The process or event in which funds are raised for a new cryptocurrency venture and contributors receive tokens in return.   EQUITY-CROWDFUNDING: When people invest through a website in a company not yet listed on a stock exchange and receive back shares in the firm.   More generic terminology often heard in fintech spheres:   KYC: Or know your client/customer. A process to ensure businesses identify and verify the identity of their clients, for anti-money laundering (AML) purposes.   ENCRYPTION: The process of encoding messages. Once something has been encrypted, a key is required to turn that code back into useful data.   OMNI CHANNEL: A retail model that integrates different purchasing methods for customers such as online, by phone or in store. Omnichannel banking, for example, means offering banking across those three methods.   ACCELERATORS AND INCUBATORS: Organizations that select entrepreneurs or startups and offer them coaching, mentoring as well as exposure to potential clients and investors - often in exchange for an equity stake.

"July 24, 2017 /  5:07 AM / 2 days ago",U.S. venture capital's digital coin quandary: cash-rich startups,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-venturecapital-digitalcurrency-idUSKBN1A90CR," NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. venture capital firms lining up for a slice of the burgeoning digital currency market are grappling with a novel challenge - some of the hottest tech startups that sell the coins just don't need their money.   Only a few years ago, digital currency entrepreneurs, like other Silicon Valley peers, had to line up to pitch their ideas to venture capitalists, who controlled their destiny as virtually the only source of funding.   So-called initial coin offerings (ICOs), where new tech companies using blockchain technology can raise millions quickly by creating and selling digital ""tokens,"" with no regulatory oversight, have turned traditional relationships upside down.   Blockchain, a public online ledger of transactions, gained prominence as a technology that underpinned the first digital currency, bitcoin.    ""The day when VCs were the elusive elite and primary source of capital for startups has ended,"" said Jamie Burke, founder and chief executive officer of VC firm Outlier Ventures, which specializes in blockchain and other technology investments.   ""When a startup can raise $35 million in 30 seconds without any dilution, the genie is out of the bottle and it isn't going back in,"" he said, referring to Brave, an open source web browser that blocks ads and trackers, which sold its Basic Attention Token in June.   By mid-July, tech firms raised about $1.1 billion in 89 coin sales this year, roughly 10 times more than that in the whole of 2016, according to data compiled for Reuters by crypto-currency research firm Smith + Crown.    Coin sales have already eclipsed funds blockchain firms received from venture capital, which invested over $300 million in equity in the sector in the first half of this year, Coindesk data showed.   Still, the tokens' strong gains on dozens of online exchanges got venture capital firms' attention and several sought to get a slice of the offers in exclusive pre-sale deals, public sales or both. Prominent venture capitalists Tim Draper and Blockchain Capital co-founder Brock Pierce told Reuters they have participated in coin offerings.   Many of these VC firms also take equity in the start-ups that issue the coins.   However, venture capital firms moving into the world of digital currencies face unprecedented pushback. Some issuers limit the size of pre-sale deals, making venture capital firms scramble like everybody else for sought-after public offers.   Pierce of Blockchain Capital said the old business model that gave venture capitalists and founders the lion's share of a company no longer worked with blockchain firms.   ""Whether VCs like it or not, venture capital will become a very small part of capital formation,"" he said.   The reason is that firms issue tokens not only to raise money but also to attract a broad group of enthusiasts who can help develop their projects hoping to lift the value of their investments.   ""Tokens can galvanize a community: lots of individuals and corporations are able to work together and improve a decentralized network,"" said Ryan Shea, co-founder of tech start-up Blockstack in New York.   Blockstack recently launched a new browser that will give users access to new applications on their own devices without remote servers.   For Blockstack's own token launch later this year, Shea said the firm plans a combination of a crowdsale and so-called ""mining"", in which market participants solve complex mathematical problems to release a coin.   ""I think if you have a few venture capitalists that come in and sweep up all the tokens, to me that's a failed token sale,"" Shea added.   Stelian Balta, developer, entrepreneur as well as founder and chief executive officer of Singapore-based hedge fund HyperChain Capital, is one such investor issuers target.   ""We help in the security audit of the tokens, we help introduce developers for coding purposes, and we have introduced the start-ups to our own network of connections,"" he said.   Venture capital firms' digital currency investments still account for only a sliver of the roughly $19.3 billion they have invested in tech-related sectors in the first half of 2017, according to data from consulting firm PwC and research firm CB Insights.   But the double-digit returns coins have delivered over the past few years is not something venture capital investors want to pass up.   According to tokendata.io, a new website that tracks initial coin offerings, these tokens trade on the exchanges at 20 times their initial sale price on average. That number is skewed by high-performing outliers and the median multiple is three.   Yet VCs sometimes have to make do with less than they bid for in token sales.   For example, U.S. startup Civic, which is building an identity verification network, trimmed venture capital firms' and other institutional orders in a pre-sale of its token, the company's co-founder and chief executive Vinny Lingham told Reuters.   Venture capitalists recognize digital coin sales as a genuine disruptive force, but argue they still have a role to play - helping blockchain startups build teams and devise longer-term business strategies.   ""The investors who bought your token, like public market investors, may be gone tomorrow, next month, or next year, having moved on to the next big thing,"" said Fred Wilson co-founder of Union Square Ventures, which has participated in coin sales. ""VCs, at least the best ones, are there for your company in good times and bad.""   Yet as long as coin sales provide quick, hassle-free access to funds, start-ups tend to focus on technical expertise and see less urgency to tap venture capital funds.   ""People who provide value are those who have insight on how blockchain works,"" said Jake Brukhman, a partner at U.S.-based CoinFund, which invests in tokens. ""I think VCs are two years behind on blockchain.""  "
"July 24, 2017 /  11:02 AM / 2 days ago",Trump son-in-law Kushner's congressional statement,,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-russia-kushner-text-idUSKBN1A9193,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - I am voluntarily providing this statement, submitting documents, and sitting for interviews in order to shed light on issues that have been raised about my role in the Trump for President Campaign and during the transition period.  I am not a person who has sought the spotlight. First in my business and now in public service, I have worked on achieving goals, and have left it to others to work on media and public  perception. Because there has been a great deal of conjecture, speculation, and inaccurate information about me, I am grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight.  My Role in the Trump for President Campaign  Before joining the administration, I worked in the private sector, building and managing companies. My experience was in business, not politics, and it was not my initial intent to play a large role in my father-in-law's campaign when he decided to run for President. However, as the campaign progressed, I was called on to assist with various tasks and aspects of the campaign, and took on more and more responsibility.   Over the course of the primaries and general election campaign, my role continued to evolve. I ultimately worked with the finance, scheduling, communications, speechwriting, polling, data and digital teams, as well as becoming a point of contact for foreign government officials.  All of these were tasks that I had never performed on a campaign previously. When I was faced with a new challenge, I would reach out to contacts, ask advice, find the right person to manage the specific challenge, and work with that person to develop and execute a plan of action. I was lucky to work with some incredibly talented people along the way, all of whom  made significant contributions toward the campaign’s ultimate success. Our nimble culture allowed us to adjust to the ever-changing circumstances and make changes on the fly as the  situation warranted. I share this information because these actions should be viewed through the lens of a fast-paced campaign with thousands of meetings and interactions, some of which were impactful and memorable and many of which were not.  It is also important to note that a campaign’s success starts with its message and its messenger. Donald Trump had the right vision for America and delivered his message perfectly. The results speak for themselves. Not only did President Trump defeat sixteen skilled and experienced primary opponents and win the presidency; he did so spending a fraction of what his opponent spent in the general election. He outworked his opponent and ran one of the best campaigns in history using both modern technology and traditional methods to bring his message to the American people.  Campaign Contacts with Foreign Persons   When it became apparent that my father-in-law was going to be the Republican nominee for President, as normally happens, a number of officials from foreign countries attempted to reach out to the campaign. My father-in-law asked me to be a point of contact with these foreign countries. These were not contacts that I initiated, but, over the course of the campaign, I had incoming contacts with people from approximately 15 countries. To put these requests in context, I must have received thousands of calls, letters and emails from people looking to talk or meet on a variety of issues and topics, including hundreds from outside the United States. While I could not be responsive to everyone, I tried to be respectful of any foreign government contacts with whom it would be important to maintain an ongoing, productive working relationship were the candidate to prevail. To that end, I called on a variety of people with deep experience, such as Dr. Henry Kissinger, for advice on policy for the candidate, which countries/representatives with which the campaign should engage, and what messaging would resonate. In addition, it was typical for me to receive 200 or more emails a day during the campaign. I did not have the time to read every one, especially long emails from unknown senders or email chains to which I was added at some later point in the exchange.  With respect to my contacts with Russia or Russian representatives during the campaign, there were hardly any. The first that I can recall was at the Mayflower Hotel in  Washington, D.C. in April 2016. This was when then candidate Trump was delivering a major foreign policy speech. Doing the event and speech had been my idea, and I oversaw its execution. I arrived at the hotel early to make sure all logistics were in order. After that, I stopped into the reception to thank the host of the event, Dimitri Simes, the publisher of the bi-monthly foreign policy magazine, The National Interest, who had done a great job putting everything together. Mr. Simes and his group had created the guest list and extended the invitations for the event. He introduced me to several guests, among them four ambassadors, including Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak. With all the ambassadors, including Mr. Kislyak, we shook hands, exchanged brief pleasantries and I thanked them for attending the event and said I hoped they would like candidate Trump’s speech and his ideas for a fresh approach to America’s foreign policy. The ambassadors also expressed interest in creating a positive relationship should we win the election. Each exchange lasted less than a minute; some gave me their business cards and invited me to lunch at their embassies. I never took them up on any of these invitations and that was the extent of the interactions.  Reuters news service has reported that I had two calls with Ambassador Kislyak at some time between April and November of 2016. While I participated in thousands of calls during this period, I do not recall any such calls with the Russian Ambassador. We have reviewed the phone records available to us and have not been able to identify any calls to any number we know to be associated with Ambassador Kislyak and I am highly skeptical these calls took place. A comprehensive review of my land line and cell phone records from the time does not reveal those calls. I had no ongoing relationship with the Ambassador before the election, and had limited knowledge about him then. In fact, on November 9, the day after the election, I could not even remember the name of the Russian Ambassador. When the campaign received an email purporting to be an official note of congratulations from President Putin, I was asked how we could verify it was real. To do so I thought the best way would be to ask the only contact I recalled meeting from the Russian government, which was the Ambassador I had met months earlier, so I sent an email asking Mr. Simes, “What is the name of the Russian ambassador?” Through my lawyer, I have asked Reuters to provide the dates on which the calls supposedly occurred or the phone number at which I supposedly reached, or was reached by, Ambassador Kislyak. The journalist refused to provide any corroborating evidence that they occurred.  The only other Russian contact during the campaign is one I did not recall at all until I was reviewing documents and emails in response to congressional requests for information. In June 2016, my brother-in-law, Donald Trump Jr. asked if I was free to stop by a meeting on June 9 at 3:00 p.m. The campaign was headquartered in the same building as his office in Trump Tower, and it was common for each of us to swing by the other’s meetings when requested. He eventually sent me his own email changing the time of the meeting to 4:00 p.m. That email was on top of a long back and forth that I did not read at the time. As I did with most emails when I was working remotely, I quickly reviewed on my iPhone the relevant message that the meeting would occur at 4:00 PM at his office. Documents confirm my memory that this was calendared as ""Meeting: Don Jr.| Jared Kushner."" No one else was mentioned.  I arrived at the meeting a little late. When I got there, the person who has since been identified as a Russian attorney was talking about the issue of a ban on U.S. adoptions of Russian children. I had no idea why that topic was being raised and quickly determined that my time was not well-spent at this meeting. Reviewing emails recently confirmed my memory that the meeting was a waste of our time and that, in looking for a polite way to leave and get back to my work, I actually emailed an assistant from the meeting after I had been there for ten or so minutes and wrote ""Can u pls call me on my cell? Need excuse to get out of meeting."" I had not met the attorney before the meeting nor spoken with her since. I thought nothing more of this short meeting until it came to my attention recently. I did not read or recall this email exchange before it was shown to me by my lawyers when reviewing documents for submission to the committees. No part of the meeting I attended included anything about the campaign, there was no follow up to the meeting that I am aware of, I do not recall how many people were there (or their names), and I have no knowledge of any documents being offered or accepted. Finally, after seeing the email, I disclosed this meeting prior to it being reported in the press on a supplement to my security clearance form, even if that was not required as meeting the definitions of the form.  There was one more possible contact that I will note. On October 30, 2016, I received a random email from the screenname ""Guccifer400."" This email, which I interpreted as a hoax, was an extortion attempt and threatened to reveal candidate Trump's tax returns and demanded that we send him 52 bitcoins in exchange for not publishing that information. I brought the email to the attention of a U.S. Secret Service agent on the plane we were all traveling on and asked what he thought. He advised me to ignore it and not to reply -- which is what I did. The sender never contacted me again.  To the best of my recollection, these were the full extent of contacts I had during the campaign with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian  government.   Transition Contacts with Foreign Persons  The transition period after the election was even more active than the campaign. Starting on election night, we began to receive an incredible volume of messages and invitations from well-wishers in the United States and abroad. Dozens of messages came from foreign officials seeking to set up foreign leader calls and create lines of communication and relationships with what would be the new administration. During this period, I recall having over fifty contacts with people from over fifteen countries. Two of those meetings were with Russians, neither of which I solicited.  On November 16, 2016, my assistant received a request for a meeting from the Russian Ambassador. As I mentioned before, previous to receiving this request, I could not even recall the Russian Ambassador's name, and had to ask for the name of the individual I had seen at the Mayflower Hotel almost seven months earlier. In addition, far from being urgent, that meeting was not set up for two weeks -- on December 1. The meeting occurred in Trump Tower, where we had our transition office, and lasted twenty- thirty minutes. Lt. General Michael Flynn (Ret.), who became the President's National Security Advisor, also attended. During the meeting, after pleasantries were exchanged, as I had done in many of the meetings I had and would have with foreign officials, I stated our desire for a fresh start in relations. Also, as I had done in other meetings with foreign officials, I asked Ambassador Kislyak if he would identify the best person (whether the Ambassador or someone else) with whom to have direct discussions and who had contact with his President. The fact that I was asking about ways to start a dialogue after Election Day should of course be viewed as strong evidence that I was not aware of one that existed before Election Day.  The Ambassador expressed similar sentiments about relations, and then said he especially wanted to address U.S. policy in Syria, and that he wanted to convey information from what he called his ""generals."" He said he wanted to provide information that would help inform the new administration. He said the generals could not easily come to the U.S. to convey this information and he asked if there was a secure line in the transition office to conduct a conversation. General Flynn or I explained that there were no such lines. I believed developing a thoughtful approach on Syria was a very high priority given the ongoing humanitarian crisis, and I asked if they had an existing communications channel at his embassy we could use where they would be comfortable transmitting the information they wanted to relay to General Flynn. The Ambassador said that would not be possible and so we all agreed that we would receive this information after the Inauguration. Nothing else occurred. I did not suggest a ""secret back channel."" I did not suggest an on-going secret form of communication for then or for when the administration took office. I did not raise the possibility of using the embassy or any other Russian facility for any purpose other than this one possible conversation in the transition period. We did not discuss sanctions.  Approximately a week later, on December 6, the Embassy asked if I could meet with the Ambassador on December 7. I declined. They then asked if I could meet on December 6; I declined again. They then asked when the earliest was that I could meet. I declined these requests because I was working on many other responsibilities for the transition. He asked if he could meet my assistant instead and, to avoid offending the Ambassador, I agreed. He did so on December 12. My assistant reported that the Ambassador had requested that I meet with a person named Sergey Gorkov who he said was a banker and someone with a direct line to the Russian President who could give insight into how Putin was viewing the new administration and best ways to work together. I agreed to meet Mr. Gorkov because the Ambassador has been so insistent, said he had a direct relationship with the President, and because Mr. Gorkov was only in New York for a couple days. I made room on my schedule for the meeting that occurred the next day, on December 13.  The meeting with Mr. Gorkov lasted twenty to twenty-five minutes. He introduced himself and gave me two gifts -- one was a piece of art from Nvgorod, the village where my grandparents were from in Belarus, and the other was a bag of dirt from that same village. (Any notion that I tried to conceal this meeting or that I took it thinking it was in my capacity as a businessman is false. In fact, I gave my assistant these gifts to formally register them with the transition office). After that, he told me a little about his bank and made some statements about the Russian economy. He said that he was friendly with President Putin, expressed disappointment with U.S.-Russia relations under President Obama and hopes for a better relationship in the future. As I did at the meeting with Ambassador Kislyak, I expressed the same sentiments I had with other foreign officials I met. There were no specific policies discussed. We had no discussion about the sanctions imposed by the Obama Administration. At no time was there any discussion about my companies, business transactions, real estate projects, loans, banking arrangements or any private business of any kind. At the end of the short meeting, we thanked each other and I went on to other meetings. I did not know or have any contact with Mr. Gorkov before that meeting, and I have had no reason to connect with him since.   To the best of my recollection, these were the only two contacts I had during the transition with persons who were or appeared to potentially be representatives of the Russian government.  Disclosure of Contacts on My Security Clearance Form  There has been a good deal of misinformation reported about my SF-86 form. As my attorneys and I have previously explained, my SF-86 application was prematurely submitted due to a miscommunication and initially did not list any contacts (not just with Russians) with foreign government officials. Here are some facts about that form and the efforts I have made to supplement it.  In the week before the Inauguration, amid the scramble of finalizing the unwinding of my involvement from my company, moving my family to Washington, completing the paper work to divest assets and resign from my outside positions and complete my security and financial disclosure forms, people at my New York office were helping me find the information, organize it, review it and put it into the electronic form. They sent an email to my assistant in Washington, communicating that the changes to one particular section were complete; my assistant interpreted that message as meaning that the entire form was completed. At that point, the form was a rough draft and still had many omissions including not listing any foreign government contacts and even omitted the address of my father-in-law (which was obviously well known). Because of this miscommunication, my assistant submitted the draft on January 18, 2017.  That evening, when we realized the form had been submitted prematurely, we informed the transition team that we needed to make changes and additions to the form. The very next day, January 19, 2017, we submitted supplemental information to the transition, which confirmed receipt and said they would immediately transmit it to the FBI. The supplement disclosed that I had ""numerous contacts with foreign officials"" and that we were going through my records to provide an accurate and complete list. I provided a list of those contacts in the  normal course, before my background investigation interview and prior to any inquiries or media reports about my form.  It has been reported that my submission omitted only contacts with Russians. That is not the case. In the accidental early submission of the form, all foreign contacts were omitted. The supplemental information later disclosed over one hundred contacts from more than twenty countries that might be responsive to the questions on the form. These included meetings with individuals such as Jordan’s King Abdullah II, Israel’s Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu, Mexico’s Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Luis Videgaray Caso and many more. All of these had been left off before.  Over the last six months, I have made every effort to provide the FBI with whatever information is needed to investigate my background. In addition, my attorneys have explained that the security clearance process is one in which supplements are expected and invited. The form itself instructs that, during the interview, the information in the document can be ""update(d), clarif(ied), and explain(ed)"" as part of the security clearance process. A good example is the June 9 meeting. For reasons that should be clear from the explanation of that meeting I have provided, I did not remember the meeting and certainly did not remember it as one with anyone who had to be included on an SF-86. When documents reviewed for production in connection with committee requests reminded me that meeting had occurred, and because of the language in the email chain that I then read for the first time, I included that meeting on a supplement. I did so even though my attorneys were unable to conclude that the Russian lawyer was a representative of any foreign country and thus fell outside the scope of the form. This supplemental information was also provided voluntarily, well prior to any media inquiries, reporting or request for this information, and it was done soon after I was reminded of the  meeting.  As I have said from the very first media inquiry, I am happy to share information with the investigating bodies. I have shown today that I am willing to do so and will continue to cooperate  as I have nothing to hide. As I indicated, I know there has been a great deal of speculation and conjecture about my contacts with any officials or people from Russia. I have disclosed these  contacts and described them as fully as I can recall. The record and documents I am providing will show that I had perhaps four contacts with Russian representatives out of thousands during the campaign and transition, none of which were impactful in any way to the election or particularly memorable. I am very grateful for the opportunity to set the record straight. I also have tried to provide context for my role in the campaign, and I am proud of the candidate that we supported, of the campaign that we ran, and the victory that we achieved.  It has been my practice not to appear in the media or leak information in my own defense. I have tried to focus on the important work at hand and serve this President and this country to the best of my abilities. I hope that through my answers to questions, written statements and documents I have now been able to demonstrate the entirety of my limited contacts with Russian representatives during the campaign and transition. I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government. I had no improper contacts. I have not relied on Russian funds to finance my business activities in the private sector. I have tried to be fully transparent with regard to the filing of my SF-86 form, above and beyond what is required. Hopefully, this puts these matters to rest. "
"July 21, 2017 /  10:42 PM / in 2 days",Bitcoin averts split as miners back new software upgrade,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-bitcoin-split-idUSKBN1A62T4,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin on Friday averted a split into two currencies after its network supported an upgrade to its software that would enhance its ability to process an increasing number of transactions.  Bitcoin's miners have signaled their support for the so-called Bitcoin Improvement Proposal (BIP) 91, avoiding a split of bitcoin into two blockchains. The miners represent a network of computer operators who secure the blockchain or a public ledger of all bitcoin transactions  BIP 91 is the first step toward a larger effort to upgrade bitcoin through a software called SegWit2x. On Friday, the support for BIP 91 reached nearly 100 percent, exceeding the required threshold of 80 percent, according to analysts and market participants.   Some investors have warmed to bitcoin, wooed by its explosive performance and potential to compete with gold and government-issued money as a means to store value. Demand for bitcoin has grown in eight years to a market capitalization of more than $40 billion.   But fears about the bitcoin split dampened demand for bitcoin in recent weeks. After hitting record high near $3,000, bitcoin dropped as low $1,830 BTC=BTSP on the Bitstamp platform. On Friday, it traded at $2,647.  The software upgrade attempts to address the bitcoin network's limitations in processing millions of daily transactions. Bitcoin's network has not kept pace with its growth and is unable to process all the transactions fast enough.  ""BIP 91 unleashes the next wave of innovation because it has been a little bit stagnant of late for bitcoin,"" said Rob Viglione, co-founder of ZenCash, a digital coin focused on privacy and security.  Before BIP 91's endorsement, some bitcoin investors feared it could split into two independent currencies because core developers of the network and the miners each wanted different ways to increase bitcoin's scale.  A compromise between the two groups has been reached through SegWit2x.    ""Bitcoin now has a clear run to add features that allow for faster transactions with lower costs,"" said Charles Hayter, chief executive officer of digital currency analytics firm Cryptocompare.  The upgrade to bitcoin's network will not occur until autumn, said Viglione, because several things need to happen before the new software is activated.  Market participants have complained about the delay in transactions.  Analysts say a single bitcoin transaction costs on average 83 U.S. cents to execute, which means micropayments are not feasible on the network.  The network is also limited to roughly seven transactions per second. In comparison, Visa on average handles 2,000 transactions per second. "

"July 20, 2017 /  2:15 PM / 5 days ago",U.S. Justice Department shuts down dark web bazaar AlphaBay,Dustin Volz,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-cyber-idUSKBN1A51UZ,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Justice Department said on Thursday it had shut down the dark web marketplace AlphaBay, working with international partners to knock offline the site accused of allowing a global trade in drugs, firearms, computer hacking tools and other illicit goods.  Authorities said the law enforcement action was one of the largest ever taken against criminals on the dark web, part of the internet that is accessible only through certain software and typically used anonymously.   AlphaBay allowed users to sell and buy opioids, including fentanyl and heroin, contributing to a rising drug epidemic in the United States, Attorney General Jeff Sessions said at a news briefing in Washington, D.C. to announce the action.   ""The dark net is not a place to hide,"" Sessions said. ""This is likely one of the most important criminal investigations of the year – taking down the largest dark net marketplace in history.  The move struck a blow to an international drug trade that has increasingly moved online in recent years, though some experts thought its impact would be limited.  ""The takedown of AlphaBay is significant, but it's a bit of a whac-a-mole,"" said Frank Cilluffo, director of the Center for Cyber and Homeland Security at George Washington University.  Criminals, he said, ""are going to flock to other places.""  AlphaBay mysteriously went offline earlier this month, prompting speculation among its users that authorities had seized the site. It was widely considered the biggest online black market for drugs, estimated to host daily transactions totaling hundreds of thousands of dollars.  The Justice Department said law enforcement partners in the Netherlands had taken down Hansa Market, another dark web marketplace.  AlphaBay and Hansa Market were two of the top three criminal marketplaces on the dark web, Europol chief Rob Wainwright said at the press conference.  The international exercise to seize AlphaBay's servers also involved authorities in Thailand, Lithuania, Canada, Britain and France.  The operation included the arrest on July 5 of suspected AlphaBay founder Alexandre Cazes, a Canadian citizen arrested on behalf of the United States in Thailand.   Cazes was logged on to AlphaBay at the time of his arrest, allowing authorities to find his passwords and other information about the site's servers, according to legal documents.  Cazes, 25, apparently took his life a week later while in Thai custody, the Justice Department said. He faced charges relating to narcotics distribution, identity theft, money laundering and related crimes.  FBI Acting Director Andrew McCabe said AlphaBay was ten times as large as Silk Road, a similar dark website the agency shut down in 2013.  About a year later, AlphaBay was launched, growing quickly in size and allowing users to browse goods via the anonymity service Tor and to purchase them with bitcoin currency. "

But startups based in London do not yet seem ready to swap that key hub for Paris, even if they have French roots.  The nascent industry, ranging from mobile payment apps to ""cryptocurrencies"" like bitcoin, is seen by governments and business alike as crucial to the future of financial services and of vital importance, therefore, to economic growth.   Britain says fintech contributes $9 billion to the economy, provides 60,000 jobs and will continue to be a priority. But since last June's vote to leave the European Union, other countries have been jostling to replace London as the sector's main European hub.  Paris, with its huge financial sector, famous universities, and history of inventions such as world-wide-web precursor Minitel, might seem like an obvious contender. Of the top 10 European banks by global assets, four are French, and its fund management industry is also one of the biggest in the world.   Yet a recent Deloitte study ranked Paris 29th among global fintech hubs, and only seventh in Europe, thanks to a lack of investment, rigid labor laws and a reputation for being less international than other cities. London was top.   President Emmanuel Macron, a former investment banker voted in two months ago, wants to change all that. He has pledged 10 billion euros ($11.3 billion) to an innovation fund to help turn France into a ""startup nation"".   Last month the 39-year-old president attended the launch of ""F Station"" in Paris, the world's biggest startup campus.   Alain Falys, CEO of mobile payments startup YoYo Wallet, is based in a fintech co-working space in London's Canary Wharf but is originally from northern France. For him, London was the ""obvious choice"" when he was choosing a base in 2013 and he will stay put, although he said he might consider Paris if starting out now.  ""If Macron pursues his globalist, internationalist agenda - if he continues to visit incubators, speak in English, if he shows he’s really understood the force of labor reform in terms of job creation of this sector, he will draw in young people from all over Europe,"" Falys said.  ""(British Prime Minister) Theresa May will attract no one.""  Paris sees Britain's expected departure from the EU, now being negotiated, as an opportunity to lure back some of the people it has lost to London.  But no one interviewed for this article, including lobbying group Paris Europlace and trade organization FranceFintech, knew of a company that was either moving from London to Paris or opening an additional office there since the vote for Brexit.  Some startups like Transferwise, started by an Estonian and one of Britain's biggest success stories, have said they will open offices somewhere in the EU.  But many say London's prowess in both finance and technology, as well as its internationalism and light-touch regulation, will make it hard to knock off the top spot, at least for now.   The French fintech sector raised less than a tenth of the venture capital raised by Britain in 2016 - $68 million compared with $783 million, according to Deloitte.   ""We have the world’s greatest financial center and one of the biggest tech hubs in one global city – factors that cannot be replicated in Paris or anywhere else in Europe,"" London's deputy mayor for business and enterprise, Rajesh Agrawal, told Reuters.  London says that dynamic will not change, but Brexit is already affecting the city's image elsewhere.  ""We were envious, a bit scared of London,"" said Andre Meyams, co-founder of BeeAm, an online asset management marketplace, at the sidelines of the ""Fin & Tech Community"" conference in Paris last month. ""Brexit made people realize that Paris could be the future.""   The fact that Macron used to work as an investment banker, and was then economics minister, also comforts the fintech sector, which works alongside banks and other traditional financial institutions as often as it seeks to displace them.   Many banks have set up ""accelerator"" spaces, where they mentor startups and sometimes invest in them. Credit Agricole has one such space in Paris's central business district called ""Le Village"", where Bruno Van Haetsdaele, the founder of personal finance and budgeting app Linxo, works alongside 99 other startups.  ""Macron will bring trust. He's very transparent, he's very friendly to entrepreneurs, and he has a vision that's very international,"" said Van Haetsdaele.     Others say Paris's focus on the domestic market make cities such as Dublin or Amsterdam more likely successors to London.   ""What I love about London is it's so international,"" said Nikolay Storonsky, the Russian CEO of London-based foreign payments app Revolut. ""Paris is not international at all.""  Many start-ups say the most crucial change that Macron can make is to shake up France's labor laws, which they say have made it difficult to hire and fire employees.   ""You need to be flexible when you're a startup,"" said ING's head of fintech, Benoit Legrand, a Belgian who is based in Paris. ""You need to be able to test different things out.""

The platform is being built and tested by Borsa Italiana, the LSEG's Italian exchange operator, and will seek to make it easier to track and exchange shareholder information of unlisted businesses, the companies said on Wednesday.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system powering the cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared record of information that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a trusted third party.  Information on a blockchain can be viewed by all parties connected to the network but can only be amended if each participant agrees to the changes. This creates a shared golden source of data that can reduce the need for reconciliation between records held by different companies.  Information on shareholders of small and medium enterprises has traditionally been maintained manually on spreadsheets or even on paper-based records, with each party holding their own version of information.  A shared digital ledger would make it easier for companies to interact with their shareholders and provide more transparency on their ownership, LSEG said.  ""As these companies grow they will be better at interacting with their shareholders,"" David Harris, head of emerging technology at LSEG, said in an interview.  The exchange group hopes that the new technology, which is built using a type of blockchain called HyperLegder Fabric, will also make it easier for companies to access credit.  HyperLedger Fabric was recently released by Hyperledger, an open-source group led by the Linux Foundation whose members also include IBM and LSEG.  Financial institutions have been increasing their investment in blockchain over the past few years in the hopes that it can help reduce the cost and complexity of some of their processes.  While excitement around the technology has boomed, skeptics have warned that it is still in its early days and its potential may have been overblown.

""Bitcoin lacks the one thing that makes a good currency, namely stability,"" Nowotny told Austrian daily Kleine Zeitung in an interview published on Wednesday.

Led by Europe- and San Francisco-based venture capital fund Index Ventures, the fund-raising round was one of the biggest ever Series B rounds in Europe. It should provide some comfort to the British capitol as it jostles to hold onto its reputation as Europe's leading hub for the nascent fintech sector.   The investment dwarfs the 19.5 million pounds ($25 million) raised by London-based rival Monzo in its Series B round earlier this year.    Revolut, which has around 700,000 customers, over 400,000 of them based in Britain, provides payment cards that can be used abroad to pay for goods and services at the exchange rate used by banks anywhere that Mastercard (MA.N) is accepted.   Other start-ups, such as Monzo and Germany's N26, offer similar products, but Revolut says it is distinctive in offering interbank exchange rates, zero-fee international money transfers, and in allowing customers to hold and exchange up to 16 different currencies in their app-based accounts.  Revolut was set up in July 2015 by Russian-born Nikolay Storonsky, who first moved to London in 2007 to work for Lehman Bros as a derivatives trader and later also worked for Credit Suisse.    If he were starting the company now, as Britain heads out of the European Union, Storonsky would still choose London as its base, he said.   ""I don’t see any problems with Brexit,"" he told Reuters. ""London is much more international than anywhere else in Europe, (and) in terms of regulation, it’s a great place to be.""  Some fintech firms are worried about losing ""passporting"" rights, which give companies licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other. But Storonsky, whose firm has a UK e-money license, said if that happens it would only take a few months to get such a license for the rest of the EU.    Storonsky, 34, said he wanted to set up a business that acted like a bank but had less bureaucracy.   ""I just don't like banks,"" he said. ""They're so bureaucratic, with so many managers not really doing anything ... If you fired 80 percent of bankers, nothing would change.""   Revolut also announced that it is adding digital currency bitcoin BTC=BTSP to its app in response to high demand from customers. Users will now be able to hold, exchange, spend and transfer bitcoin the same way they use other currencies. Rival cryptocurrencies Ether and Litecoin will soon be added.  Revolut, whose license does not allow it to invest clients' money, gets revenue from commissions paid by merchants, from users who change more than 5000 euros ($5,736) per month and from add-ons such as insurance, which is provided by third parties through the app. It is not yet profitable, but that does not worry its founder.       ""It’s normal at this point for a start-up – this is how billion-dollar companies are being made now,"" Storonsky said.   The firm had intended on breaking even by November, but it now says that will take longer, because it is using the extra funding to expand the company into the United States and Asia.   Revolut also secured more money from London-based Balderton Capital and Californian Ribbit Capital. The latest cash injection takes its total investment so far to $83 million. It will run a further $5 million crowdfunding campaign this month.   ($1 = 0.7785 pounds)  ($1 = 0.8717 euros) "

"July 11, 2017 /  11:06 PM / 14 days ago","UK fintech start-up Revolut raises $66 million, adds bitcoin",Jemima Kelly,http://www.reuters.com/article/britain-fintech-revolut-idUSL8N1JX1CG,"LONDON (Reuters) - The ""global banking alternative"" Revolut has raised $66 million in a fund-raising round, the start-up said on Wednesday, in the latest sign that London is so far weathering Brexit to remain a global financial-technology center.   Led by Europe- and San Francisco-based venture capital fund Index Ventures, the fund-raising round was one of the biggest ever Series B rounds in Europe. It should provide some comfort to the British capitol as it jostles to hold onto its reputation as Europe's leading hub for the nascent fintech sector.   The investment dwarfs the 19.5 million pounds ($25 million) raised by London-based rival Monzo in its Series B round earlier this year.    Revolut, which has around 700,000 customers, over 400,000 of them based in Britain, provides payment cards that can be used abroad to pay for goods and services at the exchange rate used by banks anywhere that Mastercard (MA.N) is accepted.   Other start-ups, such as Monzo and Germany's N26, offer similar products, but Revolut says it is distinctive in offering interbank exchange rates, zero-fee international money transfers, and in allowing customers to hold and exchange up to 16 different currencies in their app-based accounts.  Revolut was set up in July 2015 by Russian-born Nikolay Storonsky, who first moved to London in 2007 to work for Lehman Bros as a derivatives trader and later also worked for Credit Suisse.    If he were starting the company now, as Britain heads out of the European Union, Storonsky would still choose London as its base, he said.   ""I don’t see any problems with Brexit,"" he told Reuters. ""London is much more international than anywhere else in Europe, (and) in terms of regulation, it’s a great place to be.""  Some fintech firms are worried about losing ""passporting"" rights, which give companies licenced in one EU country the right to trade freely in any other. But Storonsky, whose firm has a UK e-money license, said if that happens it would only take a few months to get such a license for the rest of the EU.    Storonsky, 34, said he wanted to set up a business that acted like a bank but had less bureaucracy.   ""I just don't like banks,"" he said.

"July 11, 2017 /  3:13 AM / 15 days ago",Chief of bitcoin exchange Mt. Gox denies embezzlement as trial opens,Thomas Wilson,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-japan-bitcoin-mt-gox-idUSKBN19W07Z,"TOKYO (Reuters) - The 32-year-old chief executive of defunct Mt. Gox pleaded not guilty on Tuesday to charges relating to the loss of hundreds of millions of dollars worth of bitcoins and cash from what was once the world's biggest bitcoin exchange.  French national Mark Karpeles filed the plea in response to charges of embezzlement and data manipulation at the Tokyo District Court, according to a pool report for foreign  journalists.  Mt. Gox once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades but filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing some 850,000 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its bank accounts.  In its bankruptcy filing, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox blamed hackers for the lost bitcoins, pointing to a software security flaw.   Mt. Gox subsequently said it had found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins.  Karpeles was indicted for transferring 341 million yen ($3 million) from a Mt. Gox account holding customer funds to an account in his name during September to December 2013. The prosecution also alleged Karpeles boosted the balance of an account in his name in Mt. Gox's trading system.  In its opening statement to the court, Karpeles' defense team did not dispute that the transfers took place, but denied they amounted to embezzlement.   Karpeles told the court he was an information technology engineer.  ""I swear to God that I am innocent,"" he said in Japanese to the three-judge panel hearing his case, according to the pool report.  The collapse of Mt. Gox badly damaged the image of virtual currencies, particularly among risk-averse Japanese investors and corporations.  But the bankruptcy also prompted Japan's government to decide how to treat bitcoin, and preceded a push by local regulators to license virtual currency exchanges.   Japan this year became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level, part of a government effort to exploit financial technology as a means of stimulating the economy.  Interest in bitcoin among Japan's legions of individual investors - encouraged by Tokyo's recognition of the virtual currency as legal tender - has spiked in recent months.  Still, institutional investors remain wary, say those running virtual currency exchanges in Tokyo. Japanese firms are also unenthusiastic: Only 4 percent of large and mid-sized firms plan to use bitcoin in the near to medium term, showed a Reuters poll last month.   The value of bitcoin is highly volatile. It hit a record high of $2,980 last month.  Like other virtual currencies, such as Ethereum and Ripple, bitcoin has no central authority and relies instead on thousands of computers across the world that validate transactions and add new units to the system - technology known as blockchain.  Bitcoin can be traded on exchanges in the same manner as stocks and bonds. It has also become a mode of payment for some retailers, and a way to transfer funds without the need for a third party. "

The group, whose more than 120 members include International Business Machines Corp, Cisco Systems Inc, the Bank of England and JPMorgan Chase & Co, said on Tuesday that it had released the first version of Hyperledger Fabric, a type of distributed ledger code.   The developers involved in the project believe Hyperledger Fabric 1.0 is strong and secure enough to be used by corporations to start building blockchain-based business applications, the group said.

""These kinds deep revolutions take some time, but I am confident that competent development teams inside organizations can start to look at that [Hyperledger Fabric] and go all the way to running it in production,"" Brian Behlendorf, Hyperledger's executive director, said in an interview.

Prosecutors said Karpeles sent around 340 million yen ($3 million) from an account that managed customers' funds to an external account between September and December 2013, and increased the balance of the account via ""improper operation"" of Mt. Gox's trading system, the Nikkei reported.  Karpeles' defence told the court he had remitted the firm's revenue, not customer funds, and that the increased balance was part of the administrative process of exchanging cash and bitcoins and therefore not illegal, according to the Nikkei.  Mt. Gox once handled 80 percent of the world's bitcoin trades but filed for bankruptcy in 2014 after losing some 850,000 bitcoins - then worth around half a billion U.S. dollars - and $28 million in cash from its Japanese bank accounts.  In its bankruptcy filing, Tokyo-based Mt. Gox blamed hackers for the lost bitcoins, pointing to a software security flaw.  Mt. Gox subsequently said it had found 200,000 of the missing bitcoins.  The collapse of Mt. Gox represented a major setback for bitcoin and badly damaged the image of virtual currencies, particularly among risk-averse Japanese investors and corporations.  But the bankruptcy also prompted Japan's government to decide how to treat bitcoin, and preceded a push by local regulators to licence virtual currency exchanges.  Japan this year became the first country to regulate exchanges at the national level, part of a government effort to exploit financial technology as a means of stimulating the economy.  Interest in bitcoin among Japan's legions of individual investors - encouraged by Tokyo's recognition of the virtual currency as legal tender - has spiked in recent months.  Still, institutional investors remain wary, say those running virtual currency exchanges in Tokyo. Japanese firms are also unenthusiastic: Only 4 percent of large and mid-sized firms plan to use bitcoin, showed a Reuters poll last month.  The value of bitcoin is highly volatile. It hit a record high of $2,980 last month. ($1 = 114.1900 yen) (Reporting by Thomas Wilson; Editing by Christopher Cushing)"

The attack did not impact Maersk's physical loading of goods, but disrupted data-reliant processes such as creating arrival notices and obtaining customs clearance - leading to congestion at some of its ports, including in the United States, India, Spain and the Netherlands.   Van Trooijen said all ports Maersk worked with were now back on stream and releasing cargo.

The cyber virus is believed to have first taken hold in Ukraine before spreading globally where it locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely.  Van Trooijen said the company did not believe Maersk was deliberately targeted, given the virus' geographic reach, and that it would continue to work with cybersecurity and software firms to ensure it was as protected as it could be.

The attack used a virus, dubbed ""NotPetya"" by some experts, to take down thousands of computers in dozens of countries, disrupting shipping and businesses. Investigators now say the hack may be far more nefarious than previously thought.  A top official in the Ukrainian Presidential Administration said it remained unclear how many computers had been compromised and the state security service was trying to establish what the hackers would do with data stolen during the attack.  A video released by Ukrainian police showed masked men in combat fatigues and armed with assault rifles raiding the offices of software developer Intellect Service late on Tuesday, after cyber security researchers said they had found a ""back door"" written into some of the updates issued by its M.E.Doc accounting software.  M.E.Doc is used by 80 percent of Ukrainian companies and installed on about 1 million computers in the country. Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said police had blocked a second cyber attack from servers hosting the software.  The company previously denied its servers had been compromised but when asked on Wednesday whether a back door had been inserted, Chief Executive Olesya Bilousova said: ""Yes, there was. And the fact is that this back door needs to be closed.""  Any computer on the same network as machines using M.E.Doc was now vulnerable to another attack, she said.  ""We need to pay the most attention to those computers which weren't affected (by last week's attack),"" she told reporters.  ""The virus is on them waiting for a signal. There are fingerprints on computers which didn't even use our product.""  Dmytro Shymkiv, deputy head of Ukraine's presidential administration and a former director of Microsoft in Ukraine, said the latest evidence further pointed to an advanced and well-orchestrated attack.  ""I am looking through the analysis that has been done on the M.E.Doc server, and from what I'm seeing, that's worrying. Worrying is a very light word for this,"" he said. ""How many back doors are still open? We don't know.""   He also said M.E.Doc's servers had not been updated since 2013, providing some indication as to how the hackers were able to access the system.  Intellect Service said Shymkiv's comments referred to a disk used to store M.E.Doc's software updates.   Cyber security experts said that while hackers have previously been known to insert viruses into software updates - thus tricking computers and system administrators into installing the malware on their own systems - the attack on Ukraine is the largest and most disruptive such assault to date.  ""We are in a new phase of cyber security and the way that sophisticated actors behave,"" said Leo Taddeo, a former FBI cyber investigator and executive with cyber security firm Cyxtera Technologies. ""I can't think of a supply chain attack that has been this thorough.""  Investigators still are trying to establish who was behind last week's attack. Ukrainian politicians were quick to blame Russia, which denied it. A Trump administration official said the U.S. government was not yet ready to accuse Russia.  Security experts from U.S.-based Cisco Systems Inc.(CSCO.O)  said they had examined Intellect's machines at its invitation and determined that an attacker had used a password stolen from an employee to log in on company computer.  After escalating the access rights of that user, the attacker rewrote configuration files, directing customers seeking updates to tampered versions stored elsewhere, at a French web hosting company.  The software with the back doors could spread through other means and the attackers might have used those back doors to install other tools, said Craig Williams, senior technical leader for Cisco's Talos intelligence unit. But since the infected machines were instructed to check in with a command machine that has been taken offline, they do not pose the greatest remaining risk.  Instead, the big worry is what else might have been pushed out by earlier tainted updates, Williams said. With Intellect's servers disabled for now, it cannot push out ""clean"" updates to fix what customers have installed.  Williams said Talos believed the hackers were connected to previous attacks on Ukraine's electric system and that it was ""tempting"" to ascribe the new attack to a national government, since there did not appear to be a profit motive.  ""This wasn’t made for any other purpose but to destabilize businesses in the Ukraine,"" Williams said.  Technology news site Motherboard reported on Wednesday that people claiming to be behind the attack had posted a message online offering to unlock all encrypted files for a bitcoin payment of $256,000.

""Initially everybody thought, including me, that it was just an attack with a virus,"" he said. ""It was not an attack with a virus, it was opening a back door, which was a hack of the computer networks on a broad scale and then eliminating the results with a virus.""

"June 27, 2017 /  2:06 PM / a month ago",New computer virus spreads from Ukraine to disrupt world business,Eric Auchard & Jack Stubbs & Alessandra  Prentice,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-idUSKBN19I1TD,"FRANKFURT/MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - A new cyber virus spread from Ukraine to wreak havoc around the globe on Wednesday, crippling thousands of computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia.  The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said.  More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread.  Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO) said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary.  U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp (FDX.N) said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco.  The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May.  More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain.  Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said.  Ukraine, the epicenter of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbor annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014.  The Kremlin, which has consistently rejected the accusations, said on Wednesday it had no information about the origin of the global cyber attack, which also struck Russian companies such as oil giant Rosneft (ROSN.MM) and a steelmaker.  ""No one can effectively combat cyber threats on their own, and, unfortunately, unfounded blanket accusations will not solve this problem,"" said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov.  ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent.  The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.  ""My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,"" Lord told Reuters on Wednesday.  While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack.  Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organization but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect.  Bushiness that installed Microsoft's (MSFT.O) latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected.  There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update.  After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft (MSFT.O) security patches.  Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said ""a small number"" of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down.  Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's (CSCO.O) Talos and Symantec (SYMC.O) said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software program called MEDoc.  The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards.  ""Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,"" it said in a technical blog post.  Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines.  A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country.  Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine.  Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country.  Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted.  Other companies to succumb included BNP Paribas Real Estate (BNPP.PA), a part of the French bank that provides property and investment management services.  ""The international cyber attack hit our non-bank subsidiary, Real Estate. The necessary measures have been taken to rapidly contain the attack,"" the bank said on Wednesday.  Production at the Cadbury factory on the Australian island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down.  Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said on Tuesday its systems had suffered ""serious consequences"" but oil production had not been affected because it switched to backup systems.

This week's cyber attack hit targets from Ukraine to the United States and more than 60 other countries. Human error enables hacking of today's network setups. A shift to the cloud reduces that danger, but brings others.   The latest rogue software, a variant of something called Petya, locks computers and posts a message demanding $300 in bitcoins to recover the data. Like the WannaCry virus last month that hit National Health Service computers in the UK, among others, it gets into PCs using code known as Eternal Blue, which security experts believe was developed by the U.S. National Security Agency.   Monday's attack hit Ukraine's international airport, Russian oil group Rosneft, advertising giant WPP and FedEx's TNT Express unit, among others. Its spread may have been limited, though, because after WannaCry many firms patched software including older Microsoft operating systems.   The fact that this wasn't done earlier is a reminder that current IT architecture depends on people to maintain it. And people can let the bad guys in, too. Malevolent phishing emails abound. Though it was done in fun, the fact that the CEOs of Goldman Sachs, Citigroup and Barclays – not to mention the head of the Bank of England – recently responded to prank emails purporting to be from colleagues underlines the human factor.   The cloud, comprising infrastructure managed by the likes of Amazon, Alphabet and Microsoft, ought to be immune from much of this. Protection should be cutting-edge, for example, and advanced detection tools should be in place. Software run in the cloud doesn't need users to update it. Data should be recoverable even if one copy is corrupted.   Yet there are new concerns, too. With today's hybrid system, cloud-based software can propagate Petya or other malicious agents rapidly. A cloud outage can affect far more users than a cyber attack, as customers of Amazon found out in March when part of the company's cloud went dark. Companies may need to hire multiple cloud-services providers to minimize this risk.   And of course cyber criminals and unfriendly state actors will simply set their sights higher. After all, holding the entire cloud to ransom sounds a lot more lucrative than targeting any number of individual computers.

ESET, a Slovakian company that sells products to shield computers from viruses, said 80 percent of the infections detected among its global customer base were in Ukraine, with Italy second hardest hit with about 10 percent.  The aim of the latest attack appeared to be disruption rather than ransom, said Brian Lord, former deputy director of intelligence and cyber operations at Britain's GCHQ and now managing director at private security firm PGI Cyber.  ""My sense is this starts to look like a state operating through a proxy ... as a kind of experiment to see what happens,"" Lord told Reuters on Wednesday.  While the malware seemed to be a variant of past campaigns, derived from code known as Eternal Blue believed to have been developed by the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), experts said it was not as virulent as May's WannaCry attack.  Security researchers said Tuesday's virus could leap from computer to computer once unleashed within an organization but, unlike WannaCry, it could not randomly trawl the internet for its next victims, limiting its scope to infect.  Bushiness that installed Microsoft's (MSFT.O) latest security patches from earlier this year and turned off Windows file-sharing features appeared to be largely unaffected.  There was speculation, however, among some experts that once the new virus had infected one computer it could spread to other machines on the same network, even if those devices had received a security update.  After WannaCry, governments, security firms and industrial groups advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft (MSFT.O) security patches.  Austria's government-backed Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) said ""a small number"" of international firms appeared to be affected, with tens of thousands of computers taken down.  Security firms including Microsoft, Cisco's (CSCO.O) Talos and Symantec (SYMC.O) said they had confirmed some of the initial infections occurred when malware was transmitted to users of a Ukrainian tax software program called MEDoc.  The supplier of the software, M.E.Doc denied in a post on Facebook that its software was to blame, though Microsoft reiterated its suspicions afterwards.  ""Microsoft now has evidence that a few active infections of the ransomware initially started from the legitimate MEDoc updater process,"" it said in a technical blog post.  Russian security firm Kaspersky said a Ukrainian news site for the city of Bakhumut was also hacked and used to distribute the ransomware to visitors, encrypting data on their machines.  A number of the international firms hit have operations in Ukraine, and the virus is believed to have spread within global corporate networks after gaining traction within the country.  Shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk (MAERSKb.CO), which handles one in seven containers shipped worldwide, has a logistics unit in Ukraine.  Other large firms affected, such as French construction materials company Saint Gobain (SGOB.PA) and Mondelez International Inc (MDLZ.O), which owns chocolate brand Cadbury, also have operations in the country.  Maersk was one of the first global firms to be taken down by the cyber attack and its operations at major ports such as Mumbai in India, Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Los Angeles on the U.S. west coast were disrupted.

"June 28, 2017 /  5:23 PM / a month ago",New computer virus spreads from Ukraine to disrupt world business,Eric Auchard & Jack Stubbs & Alessandra  Prentice,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-attack-idUSL1N1JP19U,"FRANKFURT/MOSCOW/KIEV (Reuters) - A new cyber virus spread from Ukraine to wreak havoc around the globe on Wednesday, crippling thousands of computers, disrupting ports from Mumbai to Los Angeles and halting production at a chocolate factory in Australia.  The virus is believed to have first taken hold on Tuesday in Ukraine where it silently infected computers after users downloaded a popular tax accounting package or visited a local news site, national police and international cyber experts said.  More than a day after it first struck, companies around the world were still wrestling with the fallout while cyber security experts scrambled to find a way to stem the spread.  Danish shipping giant A.P. Moller-Maersk said it was struggling to process orders and shift cargoes, congesting some of the 76 ports around the world run by its APM Terminals subsidiary.  U.S. delivery firm FedEx Corp said its TNT Express division had been significantly affected by the virus, which also wormed its way into South America, affecting ports in Argentina operated by China's Cofco.  The malicious code locked machines and demanded victims post a ransom worth $300 in bitcoins or lose their data entirely, similar to the extortion tactic used in the global WannaCry ransomware attack in May.  More than 30 victims paid up but security experts are questioning whether extortion was the goal, given the relatively small sum demanded, or whether the hackers were driven by destructive motives rather than financial gain.  Hackers asked victims to notify them by email when ransoms had been paid but German email provider Posteo quickly shut down the address, a German government cyber security official said.  Ukraine, the epicentre of the cyber strike, has repeatedly accused Russia of orchestrating attacks on its computer systems and critical power infrastructure since its powerful neighbour annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea in 2014.

The rapidly spreading cyber extortion campaign, which began on Tuesday, underscored growing concerns that businesses have failed to secure their networks from increasingly aggressive hackers, who have shown they are capable of shutting down critical infrastructure and crippling corporate and government networks.  Businesses in the Asia-Pacific region reported some disruptions on Wednesday with the operations of several European companies hit, including India's largest container port, although the impact on companies and governments across the wider region appeared to be limited.  The ransomware virus includes code known as ""Eternal Blue"", which cyber security experts widely believe was stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) and was also used in last month's ransomware attack, named ""WannaCry"".  ""Cyber attacks can simply destroy us,"" said Kevin Johnson, chief executive of cyber security firm Secure Ideas. ""Companies are just not doing what they are supposed to do to fix the problem.""  The virus crippled computers running Microsoft Corp's Windows by encrypting hard drives and overwriting files, then demanded $300 in bitcoin payments to restore access. More than 30 victims paid into the bitcoin account associated with the attack, according to a public ledger of transactions listed on blockchain.info.  Microsoft said the virus could spread through a flaw that was patched in a security update in March.  ""We are continuing to investigate and will take appropriate action to protect customers,"" a spokesman for the company said, adding that Microsoft antivirus software detects and removes it.  Operations at one of the three terminals of Jawaharlal Nehru Port (JNPT) in Mumbai, India's largest container port, were disrupted.  The impacted terminal is operated by Danish shipping giant AP Moller-Maersk, which also reported disruptions in Los Angeles. JNPT chairman Anil Diggikar told Reuters the port has been trying to clear containers manually and is operating at about a third of its capacity.  India-based employees at Beiersdorf, makers of Nivea skin care products, and Reckitt Benckiser, which owns Enfamil and Lysol, told Reuters the ransomware attack had affected some of their systems.  In Australia, a Cadbury chocolate factory was hit, a trade union official said. Production at the Hobart factory on the island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down.  Cadbury owner Mondelez International Inc said in a statement overnight staff in various regions were experiencing technical problems but it was unclear whether this was due to a cyber attack.  Cybersecurity firms Kaspersky Lab and FireEye Inc told Reuters they had detected attacks in other Asia-Pacific countries but did not provide details.  Globally, Russia and Ukraine were most affected by the thousands of attacks, according to Kaspersky Lab, with other victims spread across countries including Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Poland and the United States. The total number of attacks was unknown.  Security experts said they expected the impact to be smaller than WannaCry because many computers had been patched with Windows updates in the wake of the WannaCry ransom attack last month to protect them against attacks using Eternal Blue code.  Still, the attack could be more dangerous than traditional strains of ransomware because it makes computers unresponsive and unable to reboot, Juniper Networks said in a blog post analysing the attack.  Other security experts said they did not believe that the ransomware released on Tuesday had a ""kill switch"", meaning that it might be harder to stop than WannaCry was last month.  Researchers said the attack may have borrowed malware code used in earlier ransomware campaigns known as ""Petya"" and ""GoldenEye"".  Following last month's attack, governments, security firms and industrial groups aggressively advised businesses and consumers to make sure all their computers were updated with Microsoft patches to defend against the threat.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security said it was monitoring the attacks and coordinating with other countries. It advised victims not to pay the extortion, saying that doing so did not guarantee access would be restored.  The White House National Security Council said in a statement there was currently no risk to public safety. The United States was investigating the attack and determined to hold those responsible accountable, it said.  The NSA did not respond to a request for comment. The spy agency has not said publicly whether it built Eternal Blue and other hacking tools leaked online by an entity known as Shadow Brokers.  Several private security experts have said they believe Shadow Brokers is tied to the Russian government, and that the North Korean government was behind WannaCry. Both countries' governments deny charges they are involved in hacking.  The first attacks were reported from Russia and Ukraine.  Russia's Rosneft, one of the world's biggest crude producers by volume, said its systems had suffered ""serious consequences"" but said oil production had not been affected because it switched over to backup systems.  Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Pavlo Rozenko said the government's computer network went down and the central bank reported disruption to operations at banks and firms, including the state power distributor.  WPP, the world's largest advertising agency, said it was also infected. A WPP employee who asked not to be identified said workers were told to shut down their computers. ""The building has come to a standstill,"" the employee said.  A Ukrainian media company said its computers were blocked and had received the ransom demand.  ""Perhaps you are busy looking for a way to recover your files, but don't waste your time. Nobody can recover your files without our decryption service,"" the message said, according to a screenshot posted on Ukraine's Channel 24.  Russia's central bank said there were isolated cases of lenders' IT systems being infected. One consumer lender, Home Credit, had to suspend client operations.

The attack has already disrupted computers at Russia's biggest oil company, Ukrainian banks and multinational firms with a virus similar to the ransomware that infected more than 300,000 computers last month.  Production at the Cadbury factory on the island state of Tasmania ground to a halt late on Tuesday after computer systems went down, said Australian Manufacturing and Workers Union state secretary John Short.  Factory workers ""weren't sure what it was but, as the night's gone on, they've realized there's been some significant attacks around the world"", Short told Reuters.  Cadbury owner Mondelez International Inc said in a statement released overnight staff in various regions were experiencing technical problems but it was unclear whether this was due to a cyber attack.  A Mondelez spokeswoman in Australia had no immediate comment.  The Cadbury factory, which employs about 500 people, makes about 50,000 tonnes of chocolate a year, mostly for sale in Australia. Production remained frozen on Wednesday morning and it was unclear when it would resume, Short said.  Australian staff of global law firm DLA Piper Ltd were quoted telling domestic media they were shut out of their computer systems because of the attack. DLA Piper said in a statement it was hit by a suspected malware attack and that it was ""taking steps to remedy the issue"".  Australian Cyber Security Minister Dan Tehan said the attack, a month after the similar WannaCry attack, was ""a wake-up call to all Australian businesses to regularly back up their data and install the latest security patches"".  The latest ransomware virus, named ""Petya"", has crippled computers running Microsoft Corp's Windows by encrypting hard drives and overwriting files, then demanding $300 in bitcoin to restore access.  It includes code known as ""Eternal Blue"", which cyber security experts widely believe was stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency and was also used in the WannaCry attack.  Mike Sentonas, regional vice president of U.S. cyber security company CrowdStrike Inc, said it was unclear how many Australian computers were affected by the latest attack but ""what is different about this ransomware is its ability to spread, even if a computer has been patched"".

"June 26, 2017 /  8:00 PM / a month ago",COMMENTARY: Islamic State's financial withdrawal poses big anti-laundering challenge,Joshua Fruth,http://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-laundering-isis-idUSKBN19H2FE,"COLUMBUS, Ohio, April 6 (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - As the Islamic State (IS) loses its position in Mosul, Iraq, as well as egress points in Syria, so too begins the strategic withdrawal of Sunni militants and financial assets from the area, which presents a major new challenge to anti-money laundering officers.  IS fighters will retreat through human smuggling networks to other countries. The group's illicit proceeds, which total tens of billions of dollars, are derived from plundering banks, siphoning and trafficking of black market oil, kidnapping for ransom, human trafficking, organ trafficking, and stolen antiquities, according to Western governments and analysts.   Financial institutions that aid, abet, or help facilitate the strategic withdrawal of assets and IS fighters will find themselves at risk of incurring historically large U.S. and European regulatory enforcement actions.  Intercepting and reporting these activities will be the most significant counterterrorism priorities for global banking compliance, anti-money laundering (AML), and sanctions-screening programs in the second half of 2017 and 2018.   The Islamic State's rise to power was fueled by a confluence of events in Iraq and Syria that resulted in extreme sectarian violence and a breakdown in governance in large parts of both states. The Arab Spring movement, which saw popular uprisings overthrow authoritarian rulers in Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt, also played a role by inspiring a similar revolt in Syria. The Syrian uprising, however, triggered a full-scale civil war whose chaos and influx of heavy weapons permitted the explosive resurgence of al Qaeda in Iraq (AQI), which later rebranded itself as the Islamic State. The group is designated by the U.S. State Department as a terrorist organization.  In addition to the movement of financial assets, financial institutions must also be aware that IS's pending collapse will trigger the physical movement of thousands of Islamic State fighters through a complex series of human smuggling networks, ultimately leading to Yemen, Pakistan, Afghanistan, Algeria, Sudan, and Mali, among others. The vast majority of former IS members will likely defect to al Qaeda, as the perceived ""winner"" of modern Sunni militant groups. Most will likely join the Yemen-based affiliate known as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), as well as the West-African counterpart called al Qaeda in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM).   The next sectarian Islamist battlefront is likely Yemen, which possesses significant geostrategic importance. AQAP has recently strengthened its position in Yemen, which in 2014 was plunged into chaos when Iranian-backed Houthi rebels deposed the country's Sunni-led regime, prompting a highly destructive and destabilizing Saudi-led bombing campaign a year later. Iran is concerned that AQAP's growing strength in Yemen could invite a Western invasion that would give U.S. forces control over both sides of the Gulf of Aden, thereby allowing it to choke off Iran's trade in energy and weapons.   Another group of IS militants likely intends to return to their homelands in Europe and the Caucasus region. These are hardcore IS loyalists who intend to carry out mass-casualty attacks on the West.  AML compliance specialists should renew their thinking around modern terrorism financing. In 2017, militant organizations are not predominantly financed by third parties (apart from Hezbollah receiving funds from Iran). Instead, they are self-financed through their own criminal enterprises, and IS is no exception.   Senior IS leaders are highly educated and will launder illicit assets through outside individuals with legal, compliance, and accounting backgrounds. These individuals will likely understand the regulatory environment and know how to subvert conventional AML optimization strategy based on broad transaction actions and limited Know Your Customer (KYC) collection data-points. They may take advantage of the lack of integration between KYC and transaction-monitoring within banking compliance programs. Additionally, these facilitators will likely be well-versed in sanctions-screening evasion tactics. Expect significant use of real passports with fake names, which were purchased through bribery of corrupt officials in various diplomatic consulates.  The laundering process will include shell, shelf, and seemingly legitimate front companies. Known IS leaders already named on the U.S Treasury Department's Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons List and other sanctions databases will likely not be listed on any accounts. Those names should, however, remain a high-risk concern with respect to beneficial ownership in KYC compliance programs.   Numerous banking products, from global to retail, will be affected by IS's likely strategic withdrawal. Financial institutions can minimize risk and focus on IS's financial outflow by mobilizing an optimization, rule-tuning, and development program that specifically targets emergent terrorism channels and typologies in their risk assessment, global threat landscape analysis, transaction-monitoring detection, and sanctions-screening methodology.   MOVEMENT STAGE 1: CASH TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE TO GLOBAL WIRES  Initially, IS can be expected to execute bulk cash-smuggling through its elaborate Hawala informal money-transfer network, utilizing numerous couriers supported by expert smugglers along human smuggling networks. The cash will likely transit through currency exchanges in the United Arab Emirates and Lebanon, followed by channels of international wire transfers that make extensive use of free-trade zones.   Middle East and free-trade zone banks and currency exchanges with ""check-the-box"" compliance frameworks, as well as other firms with no interest in escalating illicit activity to regulatory agencies, could facilitate these transactions through willful ignorance or direct corrupt involvement.   Banks and money transmitters in countries including Turkey, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Lebanon, Egypt, Azerbaijan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Belgium, Germany, and Sweden, among others, should be of particular concern.  Moving from global wires and currency exchanges to retail bank accounts, IS will likely make significant use of Western retail institutions, distributing wealth among major banks, credit unions, community banks, and credit card companies alike. Retail money laundering tradecraft could include false invoicing of products through online services, such as eBay or PayPal, and money transmitters, such as Western Union and MoneyGram.   Of additional concern is purchase activity related to precious metals, digital or blockchain currency, such as bitcoin, and of great significance: mobile applications. IS is staffed by many young, tech-savvy men who are well-versed in mobile technology and could make use of Facebook Payments, the ""Cash"" application, and others.   The general retail channels of movement by echelon, as with any global threat organization, will likely include movement from business checking to tactical-level checking, and then credit card accounts. Those accounts may be used to load open-loop, general-purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards through the use of manufactured spending and subversion of third-party payment processor (TPPP) reporting.   For example, CheckFree, a payment processor, cannot issue a suspicious activity report (SAR) for transactions under $2,000, and it does not require identification under $2,500. Their AML policies and procedures are posted online through open sources. Threat actors could use this information by executing transactions just under $2,000. Once prepaid cards are loaded, operatives could ""bust-out"" to cash anonymously in their new homeland.  Banking compliance programs are greatly concerned when the source of funds in a bank account is unknown, as the source could be derived from illicit proceeds. Compliance programs should be even more concerned about patterns of activity that provide anonymity to the physical individual or company.   Some typologies that indicate ""hiding in plain sight"" feature KYC information with incorrect email addresses, use of P.O. boxes, and inoperable phone numbers. With respect to telecommunications, compliance staff should look for purchases of ""burner"" phones from prepaid phone providers, as well as searching the client's phone number against instant-messaging platforms, such as ""WhatsApp,"" which provides encrypted communication used frequently by terrorists and drug traffickers.   Transactions related to private browsing, encryption, and online video games, such as World of Warcraft, provide unconventional cover for covert communications. Expect to see these purchases on retail prepaid, credit, or checking accounts.   Other transactions potentially designed to provide personal anonymity include cash-intensive ATM deposits and withdrawals, the loading of open-loop, general-purpose reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards, cyclical manufactured spending, technology purchases, and inter-state or international travel. Look for rental car transactions, as police officers cannot identify the individual by running the license plate of the vehicle.  Pay special attention to false personal identification information, such as the ""stacking"" of Arabic titles in lieu of actual Arabic naming nomenclature. For example, a name that in English reads as ""Son of Doctor Pastor Community Leader"" would not look right, and it looks wrong in Arabic, as well. Arabic naming nomenclature includes stacked titles, but naming nomenclature must be present to be valid.   Look for individual or entity accounts linked to IS hotspots that are owned by a female, but with male names listed as beneficiaries. In many orthodox Sunni Islamic countries, women generally do not own bank accounts. A cultural awareness of Islamic societal norms in certain places is helpful in sorting anomalies from conventional practices.   Also look for Arabic-language naming nomenclature in places where ethnic Arab representation is demographically uncommon. This type of data point has been relevant in identifying other militant groups, such as Hezbollah. For example, Shiite-specific Arabic naming nomenclature associated with accounts belonging to business types known as high-risk for affiliation with the Iranian Ministry of Intelligence and Security (MOIS), Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and Hezbollah have appeared in places like Venezuela and Paraguay, whose populations overwhelmingly carry Hispanic names.   From KYC and OFAC sanctions-screening perspectives, staff should pay special attention to ""real-but-fraudulent"" passports, with fake names, derived from corrupt government personnel that profit from the sale of passports. For IS fighters retreating from territories formerly under their control, passports are as important as weapons. In addition to genuine passports obtained through bribery, expect IS fighters to use counterfeit Belgian and French passports, which are relatively easy to fake, to facilitate travel throughout the Western world.  In terms of typologies, the current and future flow of IS funds will include hundreds of combinations of geographic-nexus wire channels (e.g. originating entity, originating bank, beneficiary bank, beneficiary entity), in tandem with complicated transaction-monitoring typology sets. It is critically important to understand and target these channels, typologies, financial-institution facilitators, and front-companies of concern.   Al Qaeda prefers to use non-profits and shell- or shelf companies, unlike Shiite militant group Hezbollah, which uses a trade-based money laundering (TBML) system employing seemingly legitimate front companies. Expect IS to have adapted its laundering tactics to accommodate both approaches.  Detection scenarios should be created under the hybrid threat finance (HTF) targeting doctrine. The term ""hybrid threat"" is an intelligence and warfare targeting doctrinal concept that recognizes the intersection of hostile nation-state and non-nation state threat typologies.   The HTF doctrine isolates the movement of illicit funds through detection strategies based on threat typologies, organizations, and actual threat actors. This is in sharp contrast to conventional detection strategies that use red-flagging scenarios based on broad actions like ATM withdrawals, structuring, and flow-through-of-funds, which generate excessive false-positives. Threat organizations do not operate within the confines of broad actions.  Additionally, firms should be wary of providers attempting to sell unsupervised machine-learning (UML) and artificial intelligence (AI) platforms that promise to identify threat-actors through abnormalities. Global threat organizations are skilled money launderers who layer proceeds in ways that often appear as normal business activity to the untrained eye. Such software is built by technology experts who may be unqualified on issues such as terrorism. Even so-called subject-matter experts (SMEs) who support the developers may lack the requisite background to identify the tradecraft of threat organizations.   Many AML program components can and should use UML/AI automation, but the detection of evolving and dynamic threat finance tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) is a complicated process that should be addressed by experienced intelligence professionals. There is no automated ""magic bullet"" that can detect terrorists through transaction-monitoring and risk assessments. Additionally, detection strategies must be custom-built to the global geographic nexus and product offerings of each specific financial institution.  Financial institutions must ensure they do not facilitate the withdrawal of IS fighters and financial assets. Successful implementation of an ""actor-centric"" hybrid threat finance (HTF) detection strategy will help prevent regulatory enforcement, negative media, and the proliferation of Sunni fighters to the next battlefront.

The sale is the latest capital-raising exercise by a technology startup creating its own digital currency and selling tokens to the public, a practice that has no regulatory oversight.  It will be one of the most eagerly expected token sales in recent months, analysts said.  Blockchain, a distributed ledger that came to prominence as the underlying technology behind digital currency bitcoin, is gaining popularity for its potential to track assets across all industries.   U.S. startup Civic sold $33 million in digital currency tokens for its identity verification project in a public sale, Reuters reported on Thursday.  Block.one calls the sale of EOS a ""token distribution."" The company wants EOS to be used by large businesses, enabling corporations to automate processes, monitor assets, and create multiple applications.  Brock Pierce, co-founder of block.one, told Reuters that EOS aims to be the foundation for business applications in the blockchain world.  The token sale will take place over a one-year period on ethereum, another blockchain-based currency, and some 1 billion tokens would be sold over 341 days starting on June 26, Pierce said.  According to block.one's distribution schedule, 20 percent of the EOS tokens will be sold during the first five days of the  book opening, while 70 percent will split evenly into 350 consecutive 23-hour periods of 2 million EOS tokens each, starting on July 1. The remaining 10 percent will be reserved for block.one and cannot be traded or transferred on the ethereum network.  EOS will be priced based on market demand, said Brendan Blumer, chief executive of block.one in a statement.  The last blockchain platform token that went on sale was Qtum in March, which raised $15.6 million.

"June 22, 2017 /  7:36 PM / a month ago","ANALYSIS: WannaCry attack shows trend toward 'economic' cyber threats, rising regulatory risk",Richard Satran,http://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-cyber-threats-wannacry-idUSKBN19C2RU,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The cyber attack last month known as the WannaCry ransomware incident did little damage to U.S. financial firms but it sent a warning shot for the securities industry and its regulators. The self-replicating worm infected over 200,000 computers in 150 countries, showing the potential harm fast-moving attacks can inflict and fueling new calls from regulators for firms to manage cyber risk.  The WannaCry attack set off predictable alarms from technology firms and cyber security experts. But it was more than hype and the incident was seen as one of the largest in recent history. Risk professionals at financial firms should not dismiss the chance it offers to assess the state of the art in cyber space’s dark side.   With a month’s hindsight, it’s clear that the WannaCry attack was not a particularly innovative network exploit, known as a “worm,” and it did not approach the kind of damage past cyber attacks have wreaked on computer networks. Still it generated new insights on how regulatory changes, social media and digital currencies used in ransomware -- which lets hackers take over a computer until they are paid -- are posing new threats that risk professionals need to understand.   The malicious software behind the attack was a permutation of the decades-old ""worms,"" standalone software that can replicate itself and spread through computer networks.   “This was very much a blast from the past,” said Nicholas Weaver, who heads network security research at University of California’s International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. “It was the first widespread worm in a while, and it had a motive behind it — ransomware. It was fully self-propagating and moved quickly without any human intervention from system to system.”  The global reach and the speed of the malware attack alone make it worth a full assessment and showed the need for rapid responses to attacks. In its aftermath, regulators are looking at firms' network security plans to see if they are designed to act quickly in containing and reporting similar incidents.   Most financial firms were well prepared, in part because they are the most regulated of businesses linked to the Internet, say computer security experts. In rankings of sectors that have been most harmed by cyber criminals, financial firms have been in the middle of the pack, or about average. Most U.S. financial firms had updated versions of Microsoft Windows that are frequently patched and had already been immunized against WannaCry.   But computer security consultants see risk rising for financial firms as hackers change techniques and look for new victims and exploits for which patches have not yet been installed — and the finance industry is seen as the juiciest target for a new wave of cyber criminals.   In the past, hacking has often been done for sport, and the prize has been disabling networks and winning respect among notoriety-seeking “black hat"" hackers whose aim was to expose vulnerabilities, not to generate profit. The shift in recent years has been toward economic crime made possible by anonymous digital currencies that can hide the identities of hackers in ransom schemes.   The ""black hat"" malicious hackers can buy or swap malware on the so-called dark web, made up of secretive peer-to-peer sites that are not searchable by Google and other engines and are layered behind passwords and sometimes require special software to navigate.   “Ransomware overall is only going to get worse,” said Weaver. ""Ransomware is the biggest threat people face going forward. It’s a big concern for me.”  The first big lesson from last month’s incident is that WannaCry was avoidable. Firms that applied up-to-date virus patches were protected, and quick action by firms in reporting and dismantling the malicious code helped halt its spread so it lost momentum in just a day.  The second is to back up data in case the malicious code defies the existing patches. ""You have to apply the patches and you also have to back up data,"" said Weaver. With no firewall or anti-virus software entirely fool-proof, every important piece of data should be backed up and stored securely somewhere away from the network, he added.  The third lesson is that the participation of firms was critical in halting the spread of WannaCry, a point not lost on regulators. Regulators want to make certain firms are taking all of those steps, and reporting incidents is becoming increasingly important so that malware can be identified and disabled.  Since the WannaCry outbreak, regulators stepped up their reviews of firms’ response programs and issued warnings that they will begin penalizing laggards. The New York Department of Financial Services, which issued one of the nation’s first comprehensive rule books on cyber protection, requires firms to report attacks ""as soon as possible but in no event later than 72 hours."" NYDFS said its new cyber protection regulation rules were ""designed to help prevent and mitigate the issues triggered by WannaCry.""   The NYDFS rules, which became effective in March(here), mandate bi-annual vulnerability assessments and ""systematic scans"" to review their systems' ability to withstand threats. Firms regulated by NYDFS, which oversees a wide swath of the financial services industry, are required to identify and document material deficiencies and institute remediation where needed to meet annual certifications of regulatory compliance.  The new rules include requirements for computer virus stress tests and verification from cyber security experts on the soundness of the cyber programs.   U.S. legislators within days of the WannaCry attack, proposed a new law, The Patch Act, or Protecting our Ability to Counter Hacking Act of 2017(here), introduced by Senator Brian Schatz, Democrat of Hawaii. The law would create a permanent review board of government agencies and private firms to use a federal clearing house that tracks malicious code. The plan has generated bipartisan support and the tech industry has been largely supportive, since it has addressed privacy concerns for firms that share data on network intrusions.  The Securities and Exchange Commission has also stepped up its cyber program since the WannaCry attack. The new co-chief enforcement, Steven Peikin, last week launched an initiative to crack down on cyber crime, starting with a review of cyber protection in the securities industry. He said in an interview with Reuters that ""the greatest threat to our markets right now is the cyber threat.”   Compliance teams whose systems were unscathed by WannaCry should take note of the response by regulators, who clearly took the worm attack as a call to action. While U.S. risk professionals may be winning plaudits for shielding their firms, U.S. regulators show no signs of complacency.  The attack was mild compared with some previous incidents, but luck played a part in halting a larger outbreak in the U.S. time zone. WannaCry appeared first in Asia on May 12. Authorities suspect North Korea as the source of the malware, which spread quickly to Europe and the United States.  Like many other recent attacks, the WannaCry attackers, whose identity remains unknown, were believed to have acquired malware on one of the markets that traffic in the malicious code used by hackers. The attacks were launched in multiple locations and timed to launch simultaneously.   The so-called “code execution bug” was designed to disable computers by a preset time unless a ransom of $300 to $500 was paid. The hackers left messages that they would initiate the code remotely, demanded payment in bitcoin.  Those who kept up to date on their Windows virus patches were protected. Still, there were millions of unprotected computers on networks around the world. But U.S. systems managed to avoid the serious problems seen elsewhere.  The virus caused major disruptions in the UK starting May 12, but computer security experts were credited with quickly discovering the “kill switch” that disabled the virus in many locations before it could spread in the United States. That kind of luck can't be counted on, said computer security experts. Since each viral outbreak has its own unique code, there is no guarantee the next attack will be decoded quite so quickly.  The only fail-safe is to back data up in case of an attack that hits networked data. ""You need to build your own infrastructure so your computer can catch on fire and you still have all your data,” said Weaver. ""You have to be in a position where if your computer and the attached disks catch fire you should be able to recover your data,"" said Weaver.  For years, hackers presented a widespread nuisance factor for computer users. Digital vandalism sometimes led to inconvenient computer outages and lost files. In a typical “denial of service attack” computers sent millions of messages at favored targets such as government agencies or tech firms. The result was mostly embarrassment for the victims.  The more serious attacks in the past have involved hackers working in isolation to steal personally identifiable information such as credit card numbers. Those attacks were more than mere mischief, and involved losses of money or identity theft. But such intrusions were relatively contained to clients and usually could be remediated by reaching out to customers in relatively low-cost settlements.   The rise of bitcoin has transformed the once-annoying hacker attacks to a new level that has led to potential losses that are harder to assess, although industry estimates already place it in the billions of dollars annually. Criminal networks are often loosely connected over networks like now-defunct Silk Road or the still active Shadow Brokers, and scores of dark Web sites have become gathering points for spreading malicious code.   For compliance and risk teams, the solution to an intrusion is no longer as simple as extracting the virus and going ahead with business as usual. Regulators require incident reports as soon as the event happens. The non-compliant firm risks enforcement actions and civil lawsuits if they fail to participate in quelling the attack. There are no innocent bystanders.  ""When computers are compromised and used to make an attack on another victim, the liability could be with your system,"" said John Carlin, former U.S. assistant attorney general for national security, who chairs Morrison & Foerster’s global risk and crisis management team. ""It might not seem like a big problem. But sometimes it turns out to be worse than first thought and if you don't report it to regulators from their perspective you kept it secret.""  Unlike break-ins aimed at stealing specific data sets, malware attacks are open ended, as the WannaCry attack demonstrated. Cyber insurers have been wary of the potentially vast liability posed by a widespread malware attack launched from an insured clients’ computers. It has made lining up insurance difficult, and expensive.  The rising number of attacks has led to a sharp rise in cyber security insurance, said Aviram Jenik, chief executive officer and founder of Beyond Security. The cyber threat is, ""not hopeless, but an urgent situation,"" he added. Regulators are nudging firms to insure their risk, he said, and insurers are starting to offer rates more closely calibrated to risk than in the past.  ""The industry is maturing from the previous state of 'OMG hackers will come and destroy us all' panic to a more level-headed view that cyber security is a business problem,"" said Jenik. ""And just like any other business problems, it has to be dealt with appropriately.""  With more tools to assess ""cyber security readiness,"" insurers can more easily know ""where an organization stands, in terms of their security readiness and level, thus allowing insurers to offer a more tailored policy, and with better pricing."" Since cyber crime is now decades old, more is known about the workings of cyber crime networks.   But there are vastly more cyber hacker rings carrying out illegal operations, and there is now an anonymous payment system, with bitcoin. For insurers, risk modeling is beginning to resemble other industries where the economics of the market are becoming paramount, as opposed to unknown technology exploits.  While the technology itself has not seen breakthroughs, compliance teams are facing the challenge of training and monitoring the people on cyber awareness, especially in the use of social media. The danger of social media exploits was shown this week as chiefs of numerous banking firms were hit by one or more email pranksters who fooled bosses at Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Barclays and the Bank of England.   Those breaches did not lead to revelations of sensitive information, but they did raise questions about potential vulnerabilities in email and engaging with clients, employees and counter-parties via social media.  ""It is, in many ways, an ongoing game. Software developers continually produce new and improved operating systems and do their best to minimize the risks of security exposures - but it is very difficult, if not impossible, to produce fully bulletproof software,"" said John Verver, strategic advisor to ACL ""So hackers continually look for weaknesses they can exploit, while security specialists continually test and check to see if they can find any weaknesses the developers missed or never thought about.""  ""The moral of the story is really to be ever-vigilant. Many organizations - particularly in sectors such as banking and finance - are doing a good job in their anti-hacking efforts. But inevitably some organizations are not as careful and not as stringent."" Those firms may be the most likely to be hit by hackers, unless regulators get there first.  --NYDFS rules:here  (Richard Satran is a financial journalist covering daily and emerging issues for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.)

"June 22, 2017 /  3:29 PM / a month ago",Civic sells $33 million in digital currency tokens in public sale,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-civic-blockchain-token-idUSKBN19D200,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. startup Civic has sold $33 million in digital currency tokens for its identity verification project in a public sale, the company's co-founder and Chief Executive Vinny Lingham told Reuters.  The sale is the latest so-called initial coin offering (ICO), in which creators of digital currencies sell tokens to the public in order to finance their projects, in a similar way that companies raise money with an initial public offering, except there is no regulatory oversight.  Civic, which calls the move a ""token sale"" rather than an ICO, is building an identity network which will connect companies and users and has created 1 billion tokens to achieve that goal.  The token allows for secure and low-cost access to identity verification through the blockchain, a public online ledger of transactions that leapt to prominence as the technology underpinning the first digital currency, bitcoin.    ""We're selling tokens for ID verification,"" Lingham said. The tokens are being sold for the equivalent of 10 U.S. cents, but they can only be purchased using digital currencies bitcoin and ethereum.  Of the 1 billion tokens created by Civic, 33 percent were offered in the public sale, which is continuing until June 28. Another 33 percent will be given away to companies and users to accelerate network growth, and the remaining 33 percent will remain in the company's inventory and will be available for sale only after three years, according to Lingham.   For this sale, $33 million was the maximum amount that could be raised. Proceeds from the sale of the tokens will count as revenue for the company, Lingham said.  Civic held a pre-sale several days ago, Lingham said, to ensure that the company was able to place all 330 million tokens. It was able to do that, but it decided to hold a public sale this week to allow smaller buyers to acquire up to 110 million of the 330 million total token allocation.  If this week's token offering sells out, the pre-sale buyers would only get 66 percent of their initial allocation, Lingham said.  ""We want a big network of people behind what we're trying to do,"" said Lingham. ""This is probably the most widely distributed sale with the most number of people participating.""  Lingham said Civic has more then 10,000 buyers, and as of late Wednesday, there were 28,678 people lining up to buy the token.  ""With Civic, no one person owns more than 1 percent of the tokens sold. That's built in the model,"" he added. "

"June 21, 2017 /  4:09 AM / a month ago",U.N. glimpses into blockchain future with eye scan payments for refugees,Umberto Bacchi,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-refugees-blockchain-idUSKBN19C0BB,"ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of Syrian refugees in Jordan's Azraq camp don't pay for their food with cash but by a scan of their eyes.  Purchases are then recorded on a computing platform based on blockchain - the technology behind bitcoin.  Iris recognition devices at the checkouts of the camp's supermarket authenticate customers' identities and deduct what they spend from sums they receive as aid from the World Food Program (WFP).  The U.N. agency launched the futuristic system in May as a one-month pilot involving 10,000 of Azraq's more than 50,000 inhabitants in a bid to explore blockchain's potential to cut costs and bottlenecks.  It is now looking to scale up the project to reach more than 100,000 refugees in several camps across Jordan by the end of the year.   ""We feel this is a starting point,"" said WFP's director of innovation, Robert Opp. ""There are a number of potential uses of blockchain that could dramatically change the way we reach people in terms of our efficiency, effectiveness and security.""   Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralized authority.  It has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors, given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions with no need for middlemen.  Such features have drawn investments from big business and banks around the world, as well as the attention of a number of humanitarian agencies, including WFP.  In recent years, WFP has increasingly shifted its aid giving towards cash-based assistance, which now accounts for about 25 percent of all aid it delivers.   Handing out money rather than food allows recipients to choose what they buy and eat, while helping to keep afloat local markets and economies in crisis-hit areas, it says.  In 2016 WFP's cash transfers amounted to a total of $880 million.    To move the money across the about 80 countries in which it operates, the agency relies on the services of a large number of banks and financial intermediaries that traditionally apply transaction fees of up to 3.5 percent, said Opp.  Blockchain promises to cut those costs, an alluring feature for an agency facing a chronic shortfall in funding.  And there are also other benefits.   As blockchain automatically records transactions on a secure ledger, WFP accountants can easily follow the flow of money without spending time and energy triangulating reports from stores and banks, said WFP finance officer Houman Haddad.  There is no need for advance payments, financial risk is lower and so is the possibility of fraud - such as a bank and a store colluding to inflate bills, he added.  ""Before WFP had to exclusively rely on external sources of data,"" he said. ""Now we have our own immutable record of everything that happens"".  Misappropriation of funds is an issue across the whole humanitarian sector, so it's little wonder that other agencies are also studying blockchain, said Yoshiyuki Yamamoto, special adviser for blockchain at the U.N. Office for Project Services (UNOPS).   In 2012, former Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said 30 percent of all U.N. development assistance was lost to corruption.  ""If we don't know where 30 percent of the money is, that's a big concern for everyone,"" said Yamamoto.  In January, innovation units at UNOPS, the U.N. Development Program and U.N. Women started an informal grouping to exchange information about their blockchain work, he said.   The club has since grown to about 10 members, including the U.N. children's agency UNICEF and its refugee agency, UNHCR.   ""It's a waste of time and resources if 16-plus U.N. organizations are doing the same thing separately in a silo,"" said Yamamoto.  In April the group asked private companies for ideas for possible applications of blockchain to the U.N. system. The response was overwhelming, underscoring the growing hype around the nascent technology, said Yamamoto.  ""In a word, it's crazy!"" he said, adding they received more than 70 responses, while other requests usually draw only a handful.   Finance is just one use of blockchain, and many more are yet to be explored, said Opp.  For example it could help track deliveries of food aid or securely register land titles in developing countries, he said.   That would help small farmers - who now struggle to prove ownership of their plots in the absence of paper documentation - to secure loans and increase food production.  ""Another potential is to help build identity for refugees,"" added Caroline Rusten, head of U.N. Women's humanitarian unit.  Blockchain could be used to create a secure, paperless record of skills and education that refugees can carry with them, to which information can be added as they are on the move, she said.   ""(This would allow) people to be appreciated for who they are and the qualifications they have and not just seen as refugees,"" said Rusten.   A blockchain database with information on refugees' identity and the type of support they receive would also help avoid duplications of work between different U.N. agencies.  Creating a centralized United Nations out of a ""gigantic bureaucratic system"" is still some way off, said Yamamoto.   ""It can't be done overnight,"" he said. ""We are at a very early stage"".  "
"June 21, 2017 /  4:09 AM / a month ago",U.N. glimpses into blockchain future with eye scan payments for refugees,Umberto Bacchi,http://www.reuters.com/article/un-refugees-blockchain-idUSL8N1JB54D,"ROME (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Thousands of Syrian refugees in Jordan's Azraq camp don't pay for their food with cash but by a scan of their eyes.  Purchases are then recorded on a computing platform based on blockchain - the technology behind bitcoin.  Iris recognition devices at the checkouts of the camp's supermarket authenticate customers' identities and deduct what they spend from sums they receive as aid from the World Food Program (WFP).  The U.N. agency launched the futuristic system in May as a one-month pilot involving 10,000 of Azraq's more than 50,000 inhabitants in a bid to explore blockchain's potential to cut costs and bottlenecks.  It is now looking to scale up the project to reach more than 100,000 refugees in several camps across Jordan by the end of the year.   ""We feel this is a starting point,"" said WFP's director of innovation, Robert Opp. ""There are a number of potential uses of blockchain that could dramatically change the way we reach people in terms of our efficiency, effectiveness and security.""   Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin, is a digital shared record of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet, without the need of a centralized authority.  It has become a key technology in both the public and private sectors, given its ability to record and keep track of assets or transactions with no need for middlemen.  Such features have drawn investments from big business and banks around the world, as well as the attention of a number of humanitarian agencies, including WFP.  In recent years, WFP has increasingly shifted its aid giving towards cash-based assistance, which now accounts for about 25 percent of all aid it delivers.

FireEye said it believes that a single hacker or hacking group that it dubbed FIN10 is behind the breaches due to similarities in method: how they broke into corporate systems, stealing gigabytes of sensitive data and demanding ransom paid in Bitcoin, and publicizing the stolen information by alerting bloggers.  While FireEye declined to identify victims by name, the methods described in their report echoed those used in attacks on Goldcorp, the world's third-biggest gold miner by market value, smaller operator Detour Gold, and the Casino Rama Resort.  FireEye said FIN10's degree of operational success makes more campaigns ""highly probable"" and that it had evidence suggesting the group had targeted additional victims.  FireEye said FIN10 used the moniker Angels_of_Truth at least once, claiming to attack in retaliation for Canadian sanctions against Russia. More often, it borrowed the name Tesla Team from a group of Serbian hacktivists.  FireEye believes FIN10 was flying 'false flags' with those names, with no backing from a nation-state or affiliation with organized criminals.  Angels_of_Truth was the name used by hackers who contacted a databreaches.net blogger between April and June 2015 claiming credit in Russian and English for the Detour intrusion.  The same blogger, alerted to a breach at Goldcorp in April 2016, published details on the Daily Dot website before Goldcorp acknowledged the compromise.  The Vancouver-based miner has since modified its IT processes, increased network security protocols, and worked to educate its staff about cyber risks, a spokeswoman said.  After that breach, a mining industry group formed a network to share information on cyber threats. At least six members, including Teck Resources Ltd, will take the project live next month.  FIN10 is still in contact with some victims and more targets may ""become aware of the threat in the coming weeks or months,"" said Charles Carmakal, vice president at FireEye's Mandiant unit.  Detour Gold did not respond to requests for comment. Nor did Casino Rama, which said in November that sensitive customer, employee and vendor data had been stolen. Some was reportedly later posted online, and they now face a class action lawsuit over the breach. (Additional reporting by Jim Finkle; Editing by Tom Brown)"

AIG and IBM completed a pilot of a so-called ""smart contract"" multi-national policy for Standard Chartered Bank PLC which the companies said is the first of its kind using blockchain's digital ledger technology.   The Standard Chartered policy uses blockchain to facilitate sharing of real-time information for a main policy written in the United Kingdom, where the bank is headquartered, and three local policies in the United States, Singapore and Kenya.  Big banks, investors and other financial institutions have invested millions of dollars in blockchain, hoping it could make transactions faster, easier and more secure.

Blockchain technology, which powers the digital currency bitcoin, enables data sharing across a network of individual computers.

It also notifies all of those involved about payments.  The territories selected for Standard Chartered's coverage each introduced a level of complexity for testing the technology, IBM said.

The new service is part of a push by the ""fintech"" - or financial technology - sector to compete with established financial institutions, by using digital technologies to offer cheaper and more user-friendly services, often via smartphones.    Boston-based Circle Internet operates its app-based peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin.    One of the most well-funded blockchain startups, its investors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O).   Circle Internet's international money transfer service, built on a type of blockchain called Ethereum, will allow customers to send payments between U.S. dollars, British pound sterling or euros on their mobile phones. There are no fees or foreign exchange mark-ups.   International payments, according to Circle's chief executive officer and founder, Jeremy Allaire, should not take days to be processed and should be as easy and frictionless as sending an email.   ""When's the last time you sent a 'cross-border email'?"" Allaire said in an interview. ""The idea of cross-border payments is going to completely go away. ... Our vision is for there to be no distinction between international and domestic payments.""   Circle, which processed over $1 billion in transactions in 2016 and whose customer base increased more than 10-fold in the year up to last month, does not make money from its payments service, nor does it plan to, as it reckons consumers expect these services to be free.    ""We don't think there is any money to be made in payments anymore,"" said Allaire. ""The entire business model of extracting a toll or having time delays around the movement of value is going away completely.""  Instead, the company makes money by trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both on digital currency exchanges and over the counter, at a time when the value of such web-based currencies has reached record highs. Last month alone, Circle traded over $800 million in digital assets, it said in a statement.   In May the company appointed trader Daniel Matuszewski to take over its trading division, following the departure of former treasury and trading operations chief Joshua Lim, the company's head of marketing confirmed.

"June 14, 2017 /  11:12 PM / a month ago",Goldman-backed startup Circle launches no-fee foreign payments service,Jemima Kelly & Anna Irrera,http://www.reuters.com/article/fintech-payments-circle-idUSL8N1JB5U5,"PARIS/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blockchain-based payments startup Circle Internet Financial on Thursday launched an international online money transfer service that allows people in the United States and Europe to send money to each other instantly and at no cost as it seeks to tear down borders in the payments world.  The new service is part of a push by the ""fintech"" - or financial technology - sector to compete with established financial institutions, by using digital technologies to offer cheaper and more user-friendly services, often via smartphones.    Boston-based Circle Internet operates its app-based peer-to-peer payment network using blockchain, the technology which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin.    One of the most well-funded blockchain startups, its investors include Goldman Sachs Group Inc (GS.N) and Baidu Inc (BIDU.O).   Circle Internet's international money transfer service, built on a type of blockchain called Ethereum, will allow customers to send payments between U.S. dollars, British pound sterling or euros on their mobile phones. There are no fees or foreign exchange mark-ups.   International payments, according to Circle's chief executive officer and founder, Jeremy Allaire, should not take days to be processed and should be as easy and frictionless as sending an email.   ""When's the last time you sent a 'cross-border email'?"" Allaire said in an interview. ""The idea of cross-border payments is going to completely go away. ... Our vision is for there to be no distinction between international and domestic payments.""   Circle, which processed over $1 billion in transactions in 2016 and whose customer base increased more than 10-fold in the year up to last month, does not make money from its payments service, nor does it plan to, as it reckons consumers expect these services to be free.    ""We don't think there is any money to be made in payments anymore,"" said Allaire. ""The entire business model of extracting a toll or having time delays around the movement of value is going away completely.""  Instead, the company makes money by trading bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, both on digital currency exchanges and over the counter, at a time when the value of such web-based currencies has reached record highs. Last month alone, Circle traded over $800 million in digital assets, it said in a statement.   In May the company appointed trader Daniel Matuszewski to take over its trading division, following the departure of former treasury and trading operations chief Joshua Lim, the company's head of marketing confirmed.

"June 13, 2017 /  6:05 PM / a month ago","""Initial coin offerings"" present dangers to investors, new challenge for U.S. regulators",Henry Engler,http://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-bitcoin-ico-idUSKBN1942HF,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The explosive growth of ""initial coin offerings,"" a capital-raising tool that uses bitcoin and other crypto-currencies to fund projects that leverage technologies such as blockchain, has sparked concern among experts who warn that the lack of transparency around the issuance of such coins is a concern for both investors and regulators.  The Securities and Exchange Commission is said to be taking a hard look at the increased use of such offerings, with the growth of so-called ICOs surging in recent months. The overall value of the coin market is estimated at over $90 billion, and the frenzied activity has fueled a record-breaking rise in the price of bitcoin, which hit an all-time high of $2,911.86 this week, according to the CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index (BPI)[here].  ICOs have become mired in an ongoing industry debate, with critics likening the phenomenon to the dotcom bubble in the 1990s, while proponents say the use of such coins and offerings facilitates the type of innovation that could radically transform existing business processes and industries.  A simplistic interpretation of the issuance of such coins, or tokens, is that they are an investment on a possible future payoff. For example, if a startup technology firm has a business plan to apply blockchain for a certain solution, say, improve the back-end of securities or payment processing, or enhance record keeping in the insurance sector, investors would purchase the tokens before such a solution is actually realized or operational. The ventures could receive the tokens for payment in future development of their business.  The tokens do not in themselves confer ownership of a stake in the business. Depending on how the deal is structured, the investment in the tokens might lead to a future share in revenues of the venture. In other cases, the investment can be compared to fund-raising or a crowd-funding vehicle, using tokens that could be redeemed for cash at a later date once the venture is successful. Since the issuance of such tokens is currently outside the scope of regulatory oversight, they are seen as a quick way in which tech startups can raise capital without all of the necessary requirements that would come with, say, an initial public offering in stocks.  But what seems to be fueling a lot of the recent flows into such tokens is their speculative potential, and the ability to take the tokens and exchange them for cash on many of the world’s crypto-currency exchanges. If the coin is listed on an exchange after its initial offering, then the likelihood that its value increases grows considerably, say some observers.   However, not all ICOs are created equally. Due to the complexity of the underlying projects, experts argue that investors need to have the technical expertise to be able to evaluate whether investing in an ICO makes sense. Moreover, the startup itself should provide sufficient information for investors to evaluate the investment. In some cases, the information is inadequate.  “Lots of good things have come out of the relative flexibility of ICOs and to raise capital efficiently from a community that understands the process,” Ajit Tripathi, director of fintech and digital banking at PwC, recently told Regulatory Intelligence.  “Overall, it’s a very interesting model in raising capital, but the relative lack of transparency is a concern,” he added. “Some tokens have no disclosure or underlying prospectus….the overall lack of transparency is the main issue.”  From a regulatory and legal perspective what remains contentious is whether the issuance of such coins are the equivalent to the creation of a new security, and should therefore come under the oversight and regulation of the SEC.   Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at crypto-currency advocacy group Coin Center, told a recent New York conference that what participants in the market want to avoid is the creation of a token that acts as a security.  ""It's like painting a target on yourself. Because, what does an organization like the SEC regulate? They regulate IPOs,” Van Valkenburgh told a panel on the legality of ICOs.   “That's what they regulate. So, let's just change one letter and make it a 'C' and then it's OK, right? No. Why would you adopt the terminology of the regulator when you’re building a thing you hope they don't regulate?"" he asked.  The SEC’s view on the issuance of such tokens is less than clear given the lack of public comment to date. But industry experts say they are aware that the issue is being actively explored.  “I know that this is something that’s high on their radar,” said a U.S. regulator who requested anonymity.   What might be a guide to the SEC’s thinking is its recent decision to block the listing of the first U.S. exchange-traded fund tracking bitcoin. A more-than-three-year effort by investors Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss to convince the SEC to allow it to bring the Bitcoin ETF to market stalled when the agency's staff ruled against them in March. The agency has since said it will review its prior decision (here).  Tripathi of PwC says the SEC decision shows the agency recognizes the benefits of the ICO marketplace, but is also concerned by the lack of oversight and transparency from the exchanges on which the coins are traded.  “These exchanges where tokens are traded are not exactly transparent or have the right regulatory structure or supervision,” said Tripathi. “It’s very easy for participants to manipulate prices…which the SEC highlighted in its opinion on Winklevoss.”  Specifically, the commission said it did not find the proposal to be consistent with the Securities Exchange Act, which requires “among other things, that the rules of a national securities exchange be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices and to protect investors and the public interest.”  In order to address the agency’s concerns, two things [here] were needed.  “First, the exchange must have surveillance-sharing agreements with significant markets for trading the underlying commodity or derivatives on that commodity. And second, those markets must be regulated,” the commission said.  Whether the ICO sector, populated with numerous companies, small and large, who see their unfettered status as innovators a large part of their mission and appeal, can organize themselves to meet such requirements is very much in question at the moment.

"June 13, 2017 /  7:05 PM / a month ago",SEC identifies adviser cyber security flaws,Jason Wallace,http://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-advisers-cyber-risk-idUSKBN1942KP,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - In the wake of the recent WannaCry ransomware attack, the Securities and Exchange Commission's exam team is warning investment advisers that many are failing to perform steps critical to fighting cyber security attacks.  In specific, a relatively high percentage of advisers examined are failing to conduct continuous cyber-risk assessments, nor are they performing penetration or venerability tests. The shortcomings were far higher among investment advisers than among broker-dealers, and concerns raised by the WannaCry attack were particularly relevant to smaller firms.   The weaknesses were discovered during the second round of cyber security exams under a 2014 exam initiative. The SEC conducted 75 examinations of SEC-regulated entities, aimed at assessing cyber security preparedness, including the firm's ability to protect client information.   A cyber security program without these components can expose a firm and its clients to increased risk of an attack like WannaCry. In early May, the attack infected networks of various organizations in more than 100 countries, targeting computers running the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting data and demanding ransom payments in bitcoin.  The SEC alert included data from broker-dealer and investment adviser examinations. The investment adviser category, which also included investment companies, appeared to be the least prepared for a cyber incident.   The exams found advisers are not adequately addressing cyber-risk assessments and penetration tests which are particularly relevant to smaller registrants in relation to the WannaCry ransomware incident, according to the SEC.  However, the SEC found that nearly all investment advisers examined did have a process in place for ensuring regular system maintenance, including the installation of software patches to address security vulnerabilities. Just four percent of firms had a significant number missing critical and high-risk security patches or updates.  The SEC found that 26 percent of advisers and funds examined failed to conduct periodic risk assessments of critical systems to identify cyber security threats, vulnerabilities, and the potential business consequences.   In a 2015 risk alert , announcing the second round of cyber security examinations, the SEC highlighted the importance of governance and risk assessment processes that are tailored to the adviser's business when attempting to manage cyber risk. The SEC also included a sample of documents that may be requested during examinations on the topic.   Guidance from the SEC's Division of Investment Management earlier in 2015 has proven to be a great source for the SEC's specific expectations when it comes to periodic assessments. Potential assessment topics include:  •	The nature, sensitivity and location of information that the adviser collects, processes or stores, and the technology systems employed to do so;   •	Internal and external cyber security threats and vulnerabilities to the firm’s information and technology systems;   •	The security controls and processes that the adviser currently has in place;  •	The likelihood and impact to the adviser and its clients if any information or technology systems are compromised; and   •	The overall effectiveness of the fund’s or adviser’s ability to manage cyber security risk, including whether risks are identified and appropriately addressed.  The guidance does not address initial assessments; the continuing efforts discussed presumably represent an extension of the initial cyber security assessment. In an initial assessment, taking an inventory of devices, connections, software and most importantly, sign-on capabilities that are at risk of cyber attacks is a good start. Having a complete picture of these elements will enable a firm to fully understand its cyber infrastructure and, in turn, help ongoing assessments of the program.  The SEC examination discovered that 57 percent of the investment management firms examined failed to conduct penetration tests and vulnerability scans on systems that the firms considered to be critical.   Generally speaking, a cyber security penetration or vulnerability test is an authorized simulated attack on a network that looks for security weaknesses, potentially gaining access to the system's features and data.  The SEC has not outlined any specific parameters for penetration or vulnerability tests; it assumed many firms would probably outsource the task to a third-party. However, the SEC will look for policies and records of such tests during an examination. In the 2015 risk alert, the SEC stated it will request during exams:  •	Information regarding the firm’s policies related to penetration testing, whether conducted by or on behalf of the firm, and any related findings and responsive remediation efforts taken; and   •	Information regarding the firm’s vulnerability scans and any related findings and responsive remediation efforts taken.  Lastly, the SEC also encourages broker-dealers and investment advisory firms to review the alert published by the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Computer Emergency Readiness and evaluate whether applicable Microsoft patches for Windows XP, Windows 8 and Windows Server 2003 operating systems are properly installed.  --SEC 2014 exam initiative:here  --SEC 2015 risk alert:here  --SEC 2015 Cybersecurity guidance:here  (Jason Wallace is a senior editor for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence.

PotCoin, which hopes to become the Bitcoin of the marijuana industry, is sponsoring the former National Basketball Association player's trip to North Korea to meet with the leader of the reclusive state, Kim Jong Un.  PotCoin, like Bitcoin, is a virtual currency that can be moved like money around the world anonymously without the need for a central authority.  As of 1:30 p.m. EDT (1730 GMT) on Tuesday, one PotCoin was worth nearly 19 cents, up more than 90 percent from the previous day's session, according to coinmarketcap.com. The digital currency's market capitalization rose to over $40 million.  The sponsorship details were not known but PotCoin said in a press statement that Rodman would provide more information about his trip upon returning to the United States.  Rodman said in a tweet ahead of his trip: “Thank you PotCoin.com for sponsoring my mission. I'll discuss when I return.""  PotCoin was not immediately available for comment regarding the sponsorship.  Prince Marketing Group, which represents Rodman, did not comment on any PotCoin sponsorship in a statement regarding Rodman's trip to North Korea.    Rodman's North Korea visits over the years have fueled speculation he could facilitate a diplomatic breakthrough between Pyongyang and Washington. At the same time, his trips have also faced ridicule and criticism from some U.S. politicians and activists who view them as fodder for North Korean propaganda.  More than half of U.S. states have legalized medical marijuana and eight have voted to legalize it for recreational purposes, but it remains illegal under federal law.  PotCoin, created in 2014, was originally aimed at giving  cannabis dispensaries access to banking services as federal law prohibits banks and credit unions from doing business with them. "

Governments across Asia - most notably Hong Kong and Singapore - have launched a raft of initiatives to grab a slice of the $100 billion invested in financial technology globally but the regulatory hotchpotch is making it tough for firms to scale up, the Asia Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association (ASIFMA) said in a report on Friday.  ""The regulatory landscape is very fragmented and a lot of the initiatives, though well-intentioned, are not necessarily well thought through,"" said Mark Austen, CEO of ASIFMA.  The lobby group, which represents global banks and asset managers such as Goldman Sachs and BlackRock, has called on Asian regulators to coordinate better and to adopt a consistent set of best practices for fostering fintech in the region.

"June 8, 2017 /  6:11 PM / 2 months ago",From Parthenon of banned books to pipe homes of refugees - documenta 14 kicks off,Tanya Wood,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-germany-life-documenta-kassel-idUSKBN18Z2HS,"KASSEL, Germany (Reuters) - A life-sized model of the Greek Parthenon - covered in forbidden books donated from around the world - stands in central Kassel right where Nazis once burned banned books.  It is a centerpiece of Germany's biggest contemporary art exhibit, documenta 14.  The exhibit, created by Argentine artist Marta Minujin, is also a poignant visual bridge to Athens, where a sister  documenta 14 show is being held for the first time since the prestigious exhibit began in 1955.    This year's dual exhibits include work by 160 artists from more than 50 countries, including, in Athens some rare Communist Albanian paintings.  Both the Athens and Kassel shows will continue for 100 days. Organizers expect close to a million visitors in Kassel, where the exhibit will continue until Sept. 17.  ""It's an exhibition including many artists who went through rather concrete experiences of displacement,"" Polish curator Adam Szymczyk told Reuters TV.  ""These artists and their bodies, their histories, kind of testify in many ways to this permanent state of displacement that is affecting many people around the globe.""  In Kassel, Kurdish-Iraqi artist Hiwa K. has created an exhibit with a series of ceramic pipes entitled ""when we were exhaling"" that centers on his experience after fleeing northern Iraq on foot in the 1990s, too poor to afford a hotel room, Szymczyk said.  ""He walked on foot across Turkey and then ended up for a time being in the town of Patras (Greece) where he lived in these ceramic pipes that are used for canalization,"" he said.  Hiwa K. sees the exhibit as a broader reflection on poverty, capitalism and what happens when a person no longer has room for their belongings.  ""The refugee crisis is ... the outcome of what late capitalism is producing and what it is bringing to us,"" Hiwa K. told Reuters TV. ""It is interesting to show it in Kassel because you have a big industry for weapons here which are producing weapons for other countries.""  He had hoped to turn the exhibit into an Airbnb space for documenta 14 visitors, but the city refused, citing health and safety reasons. Instead only the 13 students who helped decorate the cylinders will spend a night there during the art fair.  Across town, an installation by Mexican artist Antonio Vega Macotela, looks at the global economy and humanity, allowing visitors to push a wheel on the ""Mill of Blood"" that produces a both a metallic coin and a digital ""bitcoin.""  Macotela says the mill is reminiscent of mills used in Mexico and Bolivia to mint coins, using the labor of animals and slaves.  ""This machine is different of course because the energy is not going to be given by animals or by slaves. It is going to be given by the people coming to the documenta,"" Macotela said. "

"June 8, 2017 /  9:17 PM / 2 months ago",U.S. business schools embrace 'fintech' as students clamor for courses,Anna Irrera,http://www.reuters.com/article/usa-students-fintech-idUSL1N1J529S,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Leading U.S. business schools are trying to teach students how to become masters of financial technology, a subsector of Wall Street that has grown in size and prominence, but because the area is still ill-defined and relatively new it is hard to develop courses.  Stanford University and Georgetown University business schools are planning to offer ""fintech"" courses for MBA students for the first time this fall. New York University is planning a new course for undergraduates after launching a fintech specialization in its business school last year.  They join the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School, Columbia University's business school and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's (MIT) Sloan School of Management, which all launched similar programs in recent years.  The new courses are being driven by student demand, officials from those universities told Reuters in interviews.  A number of prominent startups have exploded onto the fintech scene in recent years, fostering interest in mobile payment apps like Venmo, digital loan platforms like SoFi and robotic wealth managers like Betterment.  ""Ten years ago everyone wanted to go into investment banking or in the trading side,"" said Reena Aggarwal, Director of the Georgetown Center for Financial Markets and Policy. ""Now the students are much more interested in innovation.""  NYU's undergraduate course, for instance, attracted enrollments from twice as many students as expected.  But the burgeoning industry is so diverse that academics said it is difficult to construct a syllabus for financial technology 101. There are no textbooks and few professors have fintech expertise.  ""For fintech, some people mean bitcoin and cryptocurrencies; some people mean the technology JPMorgan uses for trading,"" said Angela Lee, Columbia Business School's chief innovation officer. ""Everyone thinks it's sexy, and a lot of people use it colloquially without knowing what it is.""  Instead of developing traditional syllabuses, universities have been teaching students how markets are disrupted by new technology, helping them develop business ideas or offering classes on narrower topics.  For instance, MIT taught a course on blockchain, the technology that first emerged as a system underpinning the virtual currency bitcoin. Stanford's course will focus on financial inclusion, or designing affordable products and services for disadvantaged customers, said Kenneth Singleton, a management professor who will teach the class.  Universities have also invited financial technology executives to lecture.  ""There is no ready-made teaching material that you can put together,"" Antoinette Schoar, a professor of finance at MIT Sloan, said in an interview. ""You have to try your own curriculum or develop real life cases.""  Those involved with the programs said learning about fintech can help students' careers, whether they join traditional Wall Street firms or launch their own companies. They said it has also helped attract high-quality students.  One Wharton student, David Gogel, enrolled after developing an interest in fintech while working at American International Group Inc. He is now co-president of the FinTech Club, one of the largest professional organizations at the school, with 260 members.  ""Part of the reason I chose Wharton was because of its investment in fintech,"" he said in an interview."
"June 8, 2017 /  4:00 PM / 2 months ago",Nasdaq joins investment round in French blockchain startup Stratumn,Anna Irrera,http://www.reuters.com/article/nasdaq-blockchain-idUSL1N1J510Z,"NEW YORK, June 8 (Reuters) - U.S. exchange group Nasdaq Inc has joined a 7 million-euro ($7.9 million) investment round in Stratumn, which helps companies develop applications using blockchain technology, the Paris-based startup said on Thursday.  The investment was led by Open CNP, the corporate venture arm of French insurer CNP Assurance SA, with participation from the Digital Currency Group and existing investor Otium Venture, Stratumn said.  Stratumn, which employs 15 people, said it will use the funding to develop its technology and double the size of its team by the end of 2018.  ""Our new investors will enable Stratumn to continue and accelerate its development and more effectively address growing needs in our markets,"" Richard Caetano, co-founder and chief executive of Stratumn, said in a statement.  The company said it has already developed projects with large companies including CNP Assurances, Allianz France, Nasdaq, and Thales SA.  Large companies, including banks and market infrastructure providers, have ramped up investments in blockchain over the past year in the hopes of slashing costs associated with some of their most cumbersome processes, such as securities settlement and international payments.  Blockchain, which first emerged as the system underpinning cryptocurrency bitcoin, is a shared ledger of transactions that is maintained by a network of computers on the internet, rather than a centralized authority.  Proponents of the nascent technology say it offers a more secure and transparent way to record large amounts of data.  Skeptics have warned the technology is still in its early days and may need several more years before it can be deployed on a large scale.  As part of the deal, Stratumn and Nasdaq have also entered a partnership to conduct joint research and development activities on blockchain applications in capital markets, the companies said.  Nasdaq declined to comment on how much it has invested in Stratumn.  Nasdaq was one of the earliest supporters of the technology among large financial institutions.  In May 2015 it announced it would use the technology to operate its market for shares of private companies and a few months later backed San Francisco-based blockchain startup Chain.  The group is also looking to sell blockchain-based systems through its division that provides trading technology to exchanges and clearing houses globally.  ""An investment in Stratumn was a natural development for us given the experimentation projects we have successfully executed with Richard and his team over the past year,"" Jean-Jacques Louis, Nasdaq head of corporate strategy, said in a statement.

Asia's moms and pops, already regular investors in stock and futures markets, have been dazzled by bitcoin's 100 percent surge so far this year. In comparison, the broader Asian stocks benchmark has gained 17 percent over the same period.  Even after a tumble from last week's record $2,779.08 high, bitcoin rose more than 60 percent in May alone - driven higher in part by investors in Japan and South Korea stepping in as China cooled after a central bank crackdown earlier this year.  (For a graphic on bitcoin economy click tmsnrt.rs/2skLZ3c)   Over the last two weeks, and encouraged by Japan's recognition of bitcoin as legal tender in April, exchanges say interest has jumped from the two countries. Bitcoin trades at a premium in both, due to tough money-laundering rules that make it hard for people to move bitcoin in and out.  ""After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn't sleep. It's like buying a dream,"" said Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old Japanese social insurance and labor consultant who bought around 200,000 yen ($1800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings.  ""Everyone says we can't rely on Japanese pensions anymore,"" she said. ""This worries me, so I started bitcoins.""  Asia has proved fertile ground for bitcoin due to the region's thriving retail investment culture, where swapping investment tips is already common. China, Japan and South Korea are home to several of the world's busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a ranking by CoinMarketCap.  ""Right now, it's a form of speculation, like stocks,"" said Park Hyo-jin, a 27-year-old South Korean who owns around 3 million won ($2,700) of bitcoin. ""I don't think anybody in South Korea buys bitcoin to use it.""  The risks, though, are rising too.  Bitcoin is largely unregulated across Asia, while rules governing bitcoin exchanges can be patchy.

Asia's moms and pops, already regular investors in stock and futures markets, have been dazzled by bitcoin's 100 percent surge so far this year. In comparison, the broader Asian stocks benchmark has gained 17 percent over the same period.  Even after a tumble from last week's record $2,779.08 high, bitcoin rose more than 60 percent in May alone - driven higher in part by investors in Japan and South Korea stepping in as China cooled after a central bank crackdown earlier this year.  (For a graphic on bitcoin economy click tmsnrt.rs/2skLZ3c)   Over the last two weeks, and encouraged by Japan's recognition of bitcoin as legal tender in April, exchanges say interest has jumped from the two countries. Bitcoin trades at a premium in both, due to tough money-laundering rules that make it hard for people to move bitcoin in and out.  ""After I first heard about the bitcoin scheme, I was so excited I couldn't sleep. It's like buying a dream,"" said Mutsuko Higo, a 55-year-old Japanese social insurance and labor consultant who bought around 200,000 yen ($1800) worth of bitcoin in March to supplement her retirement savings.  ""Everyone says we can't rely on Japanese pensions anymore,"" she said. ""This worries me, so I started bitcoins.""  Asia has proved fertile ground for bitcoin due to the region's thriving retail investment culture, where swapping investment tips is already common. China, Japan and South Korea are home to several of the world's busiest cryptocurrency exchanges, according to a ranking by CoinMarketCap.  ""Right now, it's a form of speculation, like stocks,"" said Park Hyo-jin, a 27-year-old South Korean who owns around 3 million won ($2,700) of bitcoin. ""I don't think anybody in South Korea buys bitcoin to use it.""  The risks, though, are rising too.

While withdrawals were suspended, investors could buy and sell bitcoins on Chinese exchanges but were barred from transferring them or downloading and removing them.

The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Wednesday rejected Ulbricht's claim that he was denied a fair trial because he could not introduce evidence of corruption by two federal agents involved in his probe.  It also rejected the 33-year-old Ulbricht's claim that his prison term of life with no possibility of parole, was too long.  The three-judge panel cited the ""staggering"" $183 million of illegal drugs sold on Silk Road from 2011 to 2013, and a lower court's finding it more likely than not that Ulbricht arranged at least five murders for hire to protect Silk Road's anonymity.  ""That he was able to distance himself from the actual violence he paid for by using a computer to order the killings is not mitigating,"" Circuit Judge Gerard Lynch wrote in a 139-page decision. ""Indeed, the cruelty that he displayed in his casual and confident negotiations for the hits is unnerving.""  There is no evidence that any of the murders took place, Lynch said.  Joshua Dratel, a lawyer for Ulbricht, declined to comment, including on whether a U.S. Supreme Court appeal is possible.  A spokeswoman for Acting U.S. Attorney Joon Kim in Manhattan declined to comment.  Jurors in February 2015 found Ulbricht, of San Francisco, guilty of seven counts for helping to enable drug sales using the virtual currency bitcoin. He was sentenced three months later by U.S. District Judge Katherine Forrest.  Prosecutors said Ulbricht ran Silk Road under the alias Dread Pirate Roberts, a character from the novel popularized by the 1987 movie ""The Princess Bride,"" and that drugs distributed on the website were linked to at least six overdose deaths.  Ulbricht has admitted to creating Silk Road, but rejected suggestions that he operated it. The website was shut down in October 2013.  Dratel had argued that Ulbricht should have been allowed to introduce evidence of corruption during the probe by former Secret Service agent Shaun Bridges and Drug Enforcement Administration agent Carl Force.  Both later pleaded guilty to money laundering and other charges and were sentenced to prison after stealing bitcoins during the probe.  Lynch, however, said that while ""the shocking personal corruption of these two government agents disgraced the agencies for which they worked,"" it ""has nothing to do with whether Ulbricht operated the site as Dread Pirate Roberts.""

Japan's second-largest lender by assets said there were already 20 projects in the pipeline for the venture, utilizing blockchain technology and artificial intelligence programs in areas such as farming and travel.   Daisuke Yamada, Mizuho's chief digital innovation officer, said the challenges were cultural as well as technological, as truly new business models required a break from Japanese banks' conservative, overly risk-averse attitudes.  For that reason, he said the bank would limit its stake in the yet-to-be named venture to less than 15 percent, though Yamada would be its president and the bank would send staff.  ""If we try to pursue business innovation within the bank, we have to ask around for permission from people in risk management, compliance and others. It takes forever,"" he said in an interview.  ""It's not like building nuclear reactors or railway systems. If projects flop, all the costs wasted will be labor costs, we can move on to the next ones,"" he said.  Japan's ""megabanks"", including Mizuho, have become increasingly active in tying up with fintech start-ups but they acknowledge European and U.S. rivals such as Goldman Sachs are ahead in the game.  Yamada did not elaborate on the projects in the pipeline but said the venture planned to conduct an export trade transaction next month using blockchain technology, allowing all parties to exchange necessary documents online instead of waiting for hard copies.    Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet.   Financial firms hope the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement.  On the technology front, Mizuho suffered two massive computer system failures in the past 15 years and has twice delayed the completion of the ongoing upgrade of its backbone system.  ""My job is not related to the bank's computer system. So, I would like to see them separately,"" Yamada said when asked how a bank that is facing challenges in the existing computer system can successfully pursue fintech efforts.  "

Livingston added that 10 percent of the token would be sold in a public sale to investors, in ""initial coin offerings,"" a capital-raising scheme employed by blockchain companies that entails creating a digital asset and selling it to the public.    At the moment, ICOs are not regulated.  Blockchain emerged as the software underpinning bitcoin and is maintained by a network of computers on the internet. It has gained global traction given the technology's ability to record and track the movement of assets.  ""A crypto-currency opens a strategy that can lead to a future in digital services that is both open and better,"" said Livingston.  He noted that digital services such as chat apps and social media platforms had become controlled by a few enterprises, making it tough for smaller players to compete.  The Kin token will be used to facilitate all kinds of services, initially within the Kik platform, and eventually expand to other digital services, Livingston said.  By integrating Kin into Kik, the currency will become the most used crypto-currency in the world given the chat app's millions of monthly active users, Livingston said. ""That would give a lot of value to Kin.""  Kik will also develop a Kin rewards feature, intended to promote its use as a common currency. Through the Kin rewards program, the token will be introduced as a daily reward, which will be distributed among the currency holders reflecting each individual's or group's contribution to the overall community.  Kik's daily rewards will start at around $100,000, which will be divided among the digital service owners, he added. "
"May 24, 2017 /  2:41 PM / 2 months ago","Bitcoin soars above $2,400 to all-time high",Sruthi Shankar,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-forex-bitcoin-idUSKBN18K206,"(Reuters) - Digital currency bitcoin hit a fresh record high on Wednesday, surging above $2,400, as demand for crypto-assets soared with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain technology.  Blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a financial ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset without the need for a central regulator.  Bitcoin hit a record of $2,409 on the BitStamp platform and was last up 4.3 percent at $2,363. So far this year, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled.   A key reason for bitcoin's dominance in the nefarious online underworld, say technologists and cybercrime experts, is its size - the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is more than twice that of the nearest of hundreds of rivals.  Also, a big part of bitcoin's recent surge is the increase in demand for other digital currencies being sold in so-called ""initial coin offerings"", or ICOs. Under ICOs, blockchain start-ups sell their tokens directly to the public to raise capital without any regulatory oversight.  ""Bitcoin up 100 percent in under 2 months. Shanghai down almost 10 percent same timeframe, compared to most global stocks up. Probably not a coincidence!"", Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive at DoubleLine Capital tweeted on Tuesday.  Strong demand for bitcoins in Japan has also fueled the rise of the virtual currency that can be moved like money around the world quickly and anonymously without the need for a central authority."

So-called ""initial coin offerings"" (ICOs) are the current rage among startups in the blockchain space, enabling new companies with a technology idea to skip banks and venture capital firms when raising capital.  The blockchain is a public online ledger of transactions that first became well known as the software underpinning bitcoin, the first digital currency.  ""Whether or not you are regulated by the SEC, you still have fiduciary duties to your investors,"" said Valerie Szczepanik, the head of the SEC's distributed ledger group. ""If you want this industry to flourish, protection of investors should be at the forefront.""  The SEC official, who is also an assistant director of the commission's division of enforcement, spoke at a panel discussion at the Consensus blockchain conference in New York.  Szczepanik, however, stressed that her views were her own and did not reflect that of the SEC.   She urged the token issuers to have built-in protection mechanisms for investors and full and fair disclosure.  ""At the SEC, we like to facilitate capital-raising, but at the same time, we want to ensure a fair market,"" said Szczepanik.    These ICOs have raised red flags due to a lack of regulatory oversight. Some market participants say ICOs could be illegal because the companies are selling tokens that can be considered securities, which fall under the SEC's jurisdiction.  ""Whether a token is a security or not is a fact or circumstance-based thing and you have to really pick it apart,"" Szczepanik said.  In a separate panel discussion on Monday, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at cryptocurrency advocacy group Coin Center, issuers should stop referring to the sale of their assets as initial coin offerings.   ""It's like painting a target on yourself. Because, what does an organization like the SEC regulate? They regulate IPOs,"" said Van Valkenburgh, referring to initial public offerings. ""Why would you adopt the terminology of the regulator when you’re building a thing you hope they don't regulate?"""

The move will make the Boston-based asset manager one of a handful of large financial services firms to have integrated digital currencies into its website.   A Fidelity spokesman said the new initiative may be launched in the second or third quarter this year.  The company is testing the Coinbase holdings integration with its employees, Johnson said.    ""I love this stuff – bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain technology – and what the future holds,"" Johnson said at a blockchain conference called Consensus in New York City.    Blockchain, a shared online ledger of transactions which first emerged as bitcoin's underlying technology, has been attracting growing investments by established financial institutions which hope it can help them save money and time.     Ethereum, a type of blockchain technology which can be used to build more complex applications, has also garnered interest from mainstream corporations.   Most large financial services firms have so far steered clear of virtual currencies. Fidelity is one of a few traditional investment companies to have also openly backed the digital currency.    ""We have built proofs of concepts that accept bitcoin micro-transactions,"" Johnson said. ""We set up small bitcoin and ethereum mining operations, just done in the spirit of learning.""    Bitcoin hit a record high on Monday, with one unit of bitcoin trading above $2,2000 on the Bitstamp platform.    Fidelity has also been testing bitcoin internally by allowing it in its cafeteria, though fewer than 100 employees made purchases using the virtual currencies, Johnson added.    The Fidelity chief executive noted that usability was slowing down adoption.    ""If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point of sale today, you are going to be disappointed, Johnson said. ""If you are looking at this technology as just a faster settlement system for financial transactions ... also disappointing.""    The asset manager still has faith in virtual currencies, she added.  ""But I am still a believer – and it's no accident that I'm one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services firm that hasn't given up on digital currencies,"" Johnson said.

Over 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two tranches of the New York company's fundraising round, making it one of the largest investments in a blockchain company to date, R3 said in a statement.   The third and final tranche will open later this year.  Other major investors and companies leading the deal include ING Groep NV, Banco Bradesco SA, Itaú Unibanco SA, Natixis SA, Barclays Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co, R3 said.  R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world's largest investment banks seeking to make their operations more efficient with new technology, and its membership has rapidly grown to about 80 financial institutions.  It aims to raise $150 million from members and strategic investors, and give them a 60 percent stake.  An R3 spokesman declined to disclose the company's valuation.  Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Financial firms hope that the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement.  The completion of the first two tranches follows the departure of several large banks from R3 over the past few months, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc Banco Santander SA and Morgan Stanley  The banks have internal blockchain projects or investments in other similar startups.  State Street Corp has also left the group, the R3 spokesman added.  ""This year we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market,"" R3 Chief Executive David Rutter said in an interview. But ""we are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products,"" he added.   Skeptics have warned that it might take many years for the financial industry to reap significant benefits from blockchain.

"May 25, 2017 /  7:24 PM / in 2 months",Fintech's decentralized nature challenges regulators as industry transforms banking,Bora Yagiz,http://www.reuters.com/article/bc-finreg-fintech-banking-idUSKBN18L2JI,"NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence) - The ambiguous role of financial technology in transforming the banking sector, tenuous collaboration among banks and fintech companies, and regulatory challenges presented by fintech's decentralized nature are common themes emerging where industry participants and regulators gather.  ""It has ended banking as we know it,"" said Chris Church, chief business development officer of Digital Asset, a fintech company specializing in building encrypted processing tools, at an International Monetary Fund spring meeting this year.   The amalgam of technological innovations that go under the label fintech began in the back office but has since moved to the front line. Banks are taking multiple approaches to developing systems, and any kind of collaboration on standards is at a very early stage. Key finech advances, including distributed ledger technology such as blockchain, require regulators to devise new strategies for oversight.   ""Fintech will hinder regulatory efforts because it is based on a decentralized model,"" said Marco Santori, a partner at Cooley, a law firm, at a recent conference on the topic. ""Regulators are likely to fail not only because they lack technical expertise regarding fintech, but also because they have always been targeting nodes in the system, and never had to face such a peer-to-peer network.""  Fintech's influence was initially confined to back office services, such as record maintenance, regulatory compliance, accounting, IT services, settlements, and clearances, along with minimal client services such as online access to bank accounts and remote deposits.   Banks have been discarding error-prone manual processes, in favor of machine learning and artificial intelligence, to better manage operational risk and comply with regulations, as the flood of data makes reliance on human processes nearly impossible. Fraud evaluation in payments, for example, is now mostly done through artificial intelligence, with human intelligence or experience used mainly to design policy parameters.   Fintech's impact now is most keenly felt in front-office, client services functions, such as mobile payments, loans, asset-management, capital raising, and money transfers.   Crowdfunding allows small businesses to raise money quickly and cheaply from all over the world, often bypassing onerous collateral and credit requirements. New peer-to-peer systems eliminate intermediaries and speed up payments via instruments such as bitcoin. Lending is dramatically hastened through data-driven algorithms that quickly pre-qualify borrowers based on a handful of data points such as personal credit scores, deposit account data, tax returns, and recent bank statements.   In addition to this expediency offered by online loan application processes, there is also a growing untapped demand among small and medium enterprises (SME) for non-traditional loan types akin to credit lines.   Such lending is unprofitable for many banks because of difficulty in loan pricing, high capital requirements and high unit costs. Indeed, as a Harvard Business School study indicates, this is where the fintech firms are moving to fill the gap.   A Morgan Stanley study(here) estimates that the untapped potential for online SME lenders is $280 billion, and that the industry will grow at a 47 percent annual rate through 2020.  Such prospects are fueling investment in fintech, which reached $23.2 billion in 2016 according to an Accenture annual report.  Given their advantages, fintech firms can pose a challenge to banks' market share.  Although slow to react at first, banks have come to recognize the critical role of fintech, and that of the distributed ledger technology (""DLT"") in particular. DLT helps banks become more efficient by reducing cost, eliminating the need for reconciliation, increasing transparency, reducing settlement time, and freeing up capital.  Banks' responses to fintech have not been uniform, however, in terms of how much investment they were willing to make and the level of integration they want between the new digital activities and their traditional operations.  Some banks have adopted a ""low integration"" strategy, that is, an arms-length approach where they rely on contracting with fintech companies or investing in them.   Others have taken a bolder ""high integration"" approach through partnership arrangements –- such as the small-business lending deal between JPMorgan Chase and OnDeck -- and integrating new technologies into their loan-application and decision-making processes.   Less common among banks are those that choose to develop their own systems. This typically involves a more significant investment to automate underwriting processes, synchronize bank proprietary account data with new algorithms, and create a more customer-friendly design.  Currently, banks remain relatively reluctant to pursue beneficial partnerships with fintech companies, however. This is largely because of the ""third party oversight"" regulations, which hold banks accountable to at least three different federal regulators for the activities of their fintech partners.   Fintech provides a decentralized web for financial agents to transact with one another in a transparent, verifiable, fast, and an efficient way.   In theory then, fintech can provide regulators with more insight into potential systemic risk areas – by allowing them to track ownership and risk of assets in real time.   Despite its benefits, however, fintech's decentralized model is also making it harder for regulators to understand its various components, and to design adequate rules because they have traditionally been dealing with central hubs of activities.   Indeed, such natural hubs simply do not exist in the world of fintech.   The most salient example of fintech's decentralized use is bitcoin, a digital currency based on the distributed ledger technology. Multiple financial players use bitcoin as a peer-to-peer payment system, where no central administrator or data storage exists.  Cognizant of this, the federal Office of the Comptroller of the Currency has been active in trying to cope with fintech's advances, and has taken a principle-based approach.   The agency published a set of principles(here) to guide the development of framework for evaluating innovations in financial services based upon technology. It established an Office of Innovation with the goal of improving its ability to identify, understand, and respond to financial innovation affecting the federal banking system.  More recently, the OCC has also issued a draft licensing manual(here) to pave the way for fintech companies to obtain special purpose national bank charters, that is, limited banking licenses.   The OCC initiative has, however, touched off debate within the industry and among other state and federal regulators. Opponents say it could stifle innovation or limit state authority to protect. The model for fintech regulation, whether principles-based or prescriptive, and how will cope with the challenges of decentralization, are far from settled.  --Harvard Business School study:here%20Files/17-042_30393d52-3c61-41cb-a78a-ebbe3e040e55.pdf  --Accenture annual report:here#zoom=50  (Bora Yagiz, FRM is a New York-based Regulatory Intelligence Expert for Thomson Reuters Regulatory Intelligence, specializing in risk.

"May 22, 2017 /  11:08 PM / 2 months ago",Symantec says 'highly likely' North Korea group behind ransomware attacks,Joseph Menn,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-northkorea-idUSKBN18I2SH,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cyber security firm Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) said on Monday it was ""highly likely"" a hacking group affiliated with North Korea was behind the WannaCry cyber attack this month that infected more than 300,000 computers worldwide and disrupted hospitals, banks and schools across the globe.  Symantec researchers said they had found multiple instances of code that had been used both in the North Korea-linked group's previous activity and in early versions of WannaCry.  In addition, the same Internet connection was used to install an early version of WannaCry on two computers and to communicate with a tool that destroyed files at Sony Pictures Entertainment. The U.S. government and private companies have accused North Korea in the 2014 Sony attack.  North Korea has routinely denied any such role. On Monday, it called earlier reports that it might have been behind the WannaCry attack ""a dirty and despicable smear campaign.""  Lazarus is the name many security companies have given to the hacking group behind the Sony attack and others. By custom, Symantec does not attribute cyber campaigns directly to governments, but its researchers did not dispute the common belief that Lazarus works for North Korea.  In a blog post, Symantec listed numerous links between Lazarus and software the group had left behind after launching an earlier, less virulent, version of the malware in February. One was a variant of software used to wipe disks during the Sony Pictures attack, while another tool used the same internet addresses as two other pieces of malware linked to Lazarus.   At the same time, flaws in the WannaCry code, its wide spread, and its demands for payment in the electronic bitcoin before files are decrypted suggest that the hackers were not working for North Korean government objectives in this case, said Vikram Thakur, Symantec's security response technical director.  ""Our confidence is very high that this is the work of people associated with the Lazarus Group, because they had to have source code access,"" Thakur said in an interview.  But he added: ""We don't think that this is an operation run by a nation-state.""  With WannaCry, Thakur said, Lazarus Group members could have been moonlighting to make extra money, or they could have left government service, or they could have been contractors without direct obligations to serve only the government.  The most effective version of WannaCry spread by using a flaw in Microsoft's Windows and a program that took advantage of it that had been used by the U.S. National Security Agency, officials said privately.  That program was among a batch leaked or stolen and then dumped online by a group calling itself The Shadow Brokers, who some in U.S. intelligence believe to be affiliated with Russia.   Analysts have been weighing in with various theories on the identity of those behind WannaCry, and some early evidence had pointed to North Korea. The Shadow Brokers endorsed that theory, perhaps to take heat off their own government backers for the disaster.     Cybersecurity company Kaspersky has said it had found several similarities between the WannaCry malware from the earlier attack and those used by Lazarus. But in an interview last week, its Asia research director, Vitaly Kamluk, said it was not conclusive evidence. ""It's unusual,"" he said.    Beau Woods, deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said that the Korean language used in some versions of the WannaCry ransom note was not that of a native speaker, making a Lazarus connection unlikely.  But Thakur said that some hackers deliberately obfuscate their language to make tracing them harder. It is also possible that the writer in question was a contractor in another country, he said.  Thakur said a less likely scenario is that Lazarus' main aim was to create chaos by distributing WannaCry.  If the hackers' main objective was to earn money on the side, that would suggest an undisciplined hacking operation run by North Korea, one that could be exploited and weakened by the country's many foes.  ""The intelligence community will probably take away from this that there is a possibility of splinters in the Lazarus Group, or members who are interested in filling their own pockets, and that could help,"" Thakur said.  Lazarus has also been linked to attacks on banks using their SWIFT messaging network. Last year, hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank. Symantec said malware used in that attack was linked to Lazarus.  "

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced the vulnerability, which could be exploited to take control of an affected computer, and urged users and administrators to apply a patch.    Rebekah Brown of Rapid7, a cybersecurity company, told Reuters that there were no signs yet of attackers exploiting the vulnerability in the 12 hours since its discovery was announced.   But she said it had taken researchers only 15 minutes to develop malware that made use of the hole. ""This one seems to be very, very easy to exploit,"" she said.   Rapid7 said it had found more than 100,000 computers running vulnerable versions of the software, Samba, free networking software developed for Linux and Unix computers. There are likely to be many more, it said in response to emailed questions.   Most of the computers found are running older versions of the software and cannot be patched, said Brown.   Some of the computers appear to belong to organizations and companies, she said, but most were home users.   The vulnerability could potentially be used to create a worm like the one which allowed WannaCry to spread so quickly, Brown said, but that would require an extra step for the attacker.   Cybersecurity researchers have said they believe North Korean hackers were behind the WannaCry malware, which encrypted data on victims' computers and demanded bitcoin in return for a decryption key.       "

"May 25, 2017 /  3:06 PM / 2 months ago",Japan lender Mizuho to launch fintech venture,,http://www.reuters.com/article/mizuho-fintech-idUSL4N1IP3A5,"TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's Mizuho Financial Group will start a venture next month to create new businesses using ""fintech,"" an executive said, joining a global race in financial technology that threatens to unsettle traditional players.  Japan's second-largest lender by assets said there were already 20 projects in the pipeline for the venture, utilizing blockchain technology and artificial intelligence programs in areas such as farming and travel.   Daisuke Yamada, Mizuho's chief digital innovation officer, said the challenges were cultural as well as technological, as truly new business models required a break from Japanese banks' conservative, overly risk-averse attitudes.  For that reason, he said the bank would limit its stake in the yet-to-be named venture to less than 15 percent, though Yamada would be its president and the bank would send staff.  ""If we try to pursue business innovation within the bank, we have to ask around for permission from people in risk management, compliance and others. It takes forever,"" he said in an interview.  ""It's not like building nuclear reactors or railway systems. If projects flop, all the costs wasted will be labor costs, we can move on to the next ones,"" he said.  Japan's ""megabanks"", including Mizuho, have become increasingly active in tying up with fintech start-ups but they acknowledge European and U.S. rivals such as Goldman Sachs are ahead in the game.  Yamada did not elaborate on the projects in the pipeline but said the venture planned to conduct an export trade transaction next month using blockchain technology, allowing all parties to exchange necessary documents online instead of waiting for hard copies.    Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet.   Financial firms hope the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement.  On the technology front, Mizuho suffered two massive computer system failures in the past 15 years and has twice delayed the completion of the ongoing upgrade of its backbone system.  ""My job is not related to the bank's computer system. So, I would like to see them separately,"" Yamada said when asked how a bank that is facing challenges in the existing computer system can successfully pursue fintech efforts.  "
"May 25, 2017 /  12:07 PM / 2 months ago",Global chat platform Kik to launch digital currency,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/kik-blockchain-offering-idUSL1N1IQ2CR,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Kik Interactive, which created the chat platform Kik, said on Thursday it was launching a crypto-currency or token called Kin that would enable customers to use a whole range of digital services.  Kik is a free chat and messaging application founded in 2009 and built for teenagers, with about 300 million registered users.  The Kin token will be created on the Ethereum blockchain, another online public ledger much like that of bitcoin, the original digital currency. A sale of the token will be slated some time this year, Ted Livingston, Kik founder and chief executive officer, said in an interview with Reuters.  He said Kik would be the first social media app to create its own currency for future sale to the public.  Livingston added that 10 percent of the token would be sold in a public sale to investors, in ""initial coin offerings,"" a capital-raising scheme employed by blockchain companies that entails creating a digital asset and selling it to the public.    At the moment, ICOs are not regulated.  Blockchain emerged as the software underpinning bitcoin and is maintained by a network of computers on the internet. It has gained global traction given the technology's ability to record and track the movement of assets.  ""A crypto-currency opens a strategy that can lead to a future in digital services that is both open and better,"" said Livingston.  He noted that digital services such as chat apps and social media platforms had become controlled by a few enterprises, making it tough for smaller players to compete.  The Kin token will be used to facilitate all kinds of services, initially within the Kik platform, and eventually expand to other digital services, Livingston said.  By integrating Kin into Kik, the currency will become the most used crypto-currency in the world given the chat app's millions of monthly active users, Livingston said. ""That would give a lot of value to Kin.""  Kik will also develop a Kin rewards feature, intended to promote its use as a common currency. Through the Kin rewards program, the token will be introduced as a daily reward, which will be distributed among the currency holders reflecting each individual's or group's contribution to the overall community.  Kik's daily rewards will start at around $100,000, which will be divided among the digital service owners, he added. "

European shares are also expected to gain, with spread-betters looking to higher openings of 0.3 percent in Germany's DAX and France's CAC and 0.2 percent in Britain's FTSE.  MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan advanced 1.0 percent, hitting its highest level since May 2015, and bringing its gains so far this year to about 17 percent.  The gains were led by South Korean shares, which rose 1.0 percent to record highs. Hong Kong's Hang Seng gained 0.8 percent to its highest level since July 2015 while Taiwanese shares hit 17-year highs.  In Japan, Nikkei gained 0.5 percent.  Minutes from the Fed's last policy meeting showed policymakers agreed they should hold off on raising interest rates until it was clear a recent U.S. economic slowdown was temporary, though most said a hike was coming soon.  ""Their views seem to have changed considerably. In the past, they had said the slowdown was transitory,"" said Daisuke Uno, chief strategist at Sumitomo Mitsui Bank.  The minutes also showed that policymakers favoured a gradual reduction in its massive balance sheet.  Fed staff proposed that the central bank set a cap on the amount of bonds that would be allowed to run off each month, initially setting it at a low level and raising it every three months.  Following the minutes, the 10-year U.S. Treasuries yield fell to 2.255 percent from Wednesday's high of 2.297 percent.  Fed funds rate futures are pricing in about a 75 percent chance that the Fed will raise rates next month, moving down from more than 80 percent earlier this week .  The spectre of a slower pace of policy tightening underpinned share prices, with the S&P 500 closing at a record high.  In the currency market, the euro traded up 0.1 percent in Asia at $1.1225, having bounced back from Wednesday's low of $1.1168 and coming within sight of $1.1268, its 6 1/2-month high set on Tuesday.  The dollar stood at 111.63 yen, slipping from one-week highs of 112.13 touched on Wednesday.  Those moves have pulled the dollar's index against a basket of six major currencies  down to 97.028, near Monday's 6-1/2-month low of 96.797.  The Chinese yuan  strengthened, hitting its highest level in almost two months, on buying by major state-owned banks in what some traders thought was a show of strength a day after Moody's downgraded the country's credit rating.  Mainland Chinese shares, which were briefly unsettled by Moody's downgrade of its rating on China on Wednesday, bounced back 1.6 percent.  ""Credit downgrade wasn't a surprise after all given the delay in structural reforms such as liberalisation of capital moves. The Chinese economy looks set to grow more than six percent, so there's no reason to be that pessimistic either,"" said Shuji Shirota, head of macro economic strategy group at HSBC in Tokyo.  The Canadian dollar strengthened to a five-week high of C$1.3402 per U.S. dollar after the Bank of Canada was more upbeat about the economy than some investors had expected.  Oil prices flirted with five-week highs as investors expect oil producing countries to extend output cuts at their meeting in Vienna later in the day.  Benchmark Brent crude oil rose 49 cents a barrel, or 0.9 percent, to $54.45. U.S. light crude was up 46 cents, or 0.9 percent, at $51.82.  Both benchmarks have gained more than 16 percent from their May lows below $50 a barrel, rebounding on a consensus that OPEC and other producers will maintain strict limits on production in an attempt to drain persistent global oversupply.  Elsewhere, digital currency bitcoin hit a fresh record high, having surged 170 percent in about two months from its March low.  Demand for crypto-assets soared with the creation of new tokens to raise funding for start-ups using blockchain technology.

The U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday announced the vulnerability, which could be exploited to take control of an affected computer, and urged users and administrators to apply a patch.    Rebekah Brown of Rapid7, a cybersecurity company, told Reuters that there were no signs yet of attackers exploiting the vulnerability in the 12 hours since its discovery was announced.   But she said it had taken researchers only 15 minutes to develop malware that made use of the hole. ""This one seems to be very, very easy to exploit,"" she said.   Rapid7 said it had found more than 100,000 computers running vulnerable versions of the software, Samba, free networking software developed for Linux and Unix computers. There are likely to be many more, it said in response to emailed questions.   Most of the computers found are running older versions of the software and cannot be patched, said Brown.   Some of the computers appear to belong to organizations and companies, she said, but most were home users.   The vulnerability could potentially be used to create a worm like the one which allowed WannaCry to spread so quickly, Brown said, but that would require an extra step for the attacker.   Cybersecurity researchers have said they believe North Korean hackers were behind the WannaCry malware, which encrypted data on victims' computers and demanded bitcoin in return for a decryption key.       "

In a separate panel discussion on Monday, Peter Van Valkenburgh, director of research at cryptocurrency advocacy group Coin Center, issuers should stop referring to the sale of their assets as initial coin offerings.

Banks and commodity traders across the world are actively exploring potential uses for blockchain, the technology first developed for the crypto-currency bitcoin, in the hopes its distributed ledger approach can cut costs and reduce paperwork.  ""The whole idea is to ensure there is natural price discovery, so that you as a buyer have access to all the transactions that are taking place instantaneously,"" said Brian Pow, an equity analyst at Acumen Capital Partners in Calgary. ""What it should do is narrow the spread on pricing.""  He said that natural gas transactions currently can take 24 to 48 hours to settle depending on how quickly buyers and sellers update their records with intermediaries.  TMX said it is in talks with customers of its Natural Gas Exchange it hopes will use the prototype to track the flow of gas supplies at delivery locations in the United States.  ""As with all new technology projects, the deployment path is well defined, but there are many other factors that need to be considered in the business process, including client and customer adoption as well as legal and regulatory frameworks,"" John Lee, TMX's vice president for innovation and enterprise delivery, said in an emailed response.  TMX developed the service in partnership with Nuco Inc, which builds custom blockchain networks for businesses.  Lee said that pending proof of the benefits of the service, TMX would look to expand use of the technology at NGX but that it was still ""early days"".  The company, which also runs the Toronto Stock Exchange, the TSX Venture for junior issuers and the Montreal Exchange for derivatives, among other businesses, said in April it was testing a blockchain-based electronic shareholder voting system.  Nasdaq Inc, one of the world's largest providers of technology for exchanges and clearing houses, uses blockchain to power its U.S. market for shares of private companies and has been testing it to run proxy voting for companies listed on its exchange in Estonia.

Blockchain, the underlying technology behind bitcoin, is a financial ledger maintained by a network of computers that can track the movement of any asset without the need for a central regulator.  Bitcoin hit a record of $2,409 on the BitStamp platform and was last up 4.3 percent at $2,363. So far this year, the price of bitcoin has more than doubled.  A key reason for bitcoin's dominance in the nefarious online underworld, say technologists and cybercrime experts, is its size - the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is more than twice that of the nearest of hundreds of rivals.  Also, a big part of bitcoin's recent surge is the increase in demand for other digital currencies being sold in so-called ""initial coin offerings"", or ICOs. Under ICOs, blockchain start-ups sell their tokens directly to the public to raise capital without any regulatory oversight.  ""Bitcoin up 100 percent in under 2 months. Shanghai down almost 10 percent same timeframe, compared to most global stocks up. Probably not a coincidence!"", Jeffrey Gundlach, chief executive at DoubleLine Capital tweeted on Tuesday.

Researchers are struggling to try to find early traces of WannaCry, which remains an active threat in hardest-hit China and Russia, believing that identifying ""patient zero"" could help catch its criminal authors.  They are having more luck dissecting flaws that limited its spread.   Security experts warn that while computers at more than 300,000 internet addresses were hit by the ransomware strain, further attacks that fix weaknesses in WannaCry will follow that hit larger numbers of users, with more devastating consequences.  ""Some organizations just aren't aware of the risks; some don't want to risk interrupting important business processes; sometimes they are short-staffed,"" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave’s Israeli SpiderLabs unit.  ""There are plenty of reasons people wait to patch and none of them are good,"" said Mador, a former long-time security researcher for Microsoft.  WannaCry's worm-like capacity to infect other computers on the same network with no human intervention appear tailored to Windows 7, said Paul Pratley, head of investigations & incident response at UK consulting firm MWR InfoSecurity.  Data from BitSight covering 160,000 internet-connected computers hit by WannaCry, shows that Windows 7 accounts for 67 percent of infections, although it represents less than half of the global distribution of Windows PC users.  Computers running older versions, such as Windows XP used in Britain's NHS health system, while individually vulnerable to attack, appear incapable of spreading infections and played a far smaller role in the global attack than initially reported.  In laboratory testing, researchers at MWR and Kyptos say they have found Windows XP crashes before the virus can spread.  Windows 10, the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system franchise, accounts for another 15 percent, while older versions of Windows including 8.1, 8, XP and Vista, account for the remainder, BitSight estimated.  Any organization which heeded strongly worded warnings from Microsoft to urgently install a security patch it labeled “critical” when it was released on March 14 on all computers on their networks are immune, experts agree.  Those hit by WannaCry also failed to heed warnings last year from Microsoft to disable a file sharing feature in Windows known as SMB, which a covert hacker group calling itself Shadow Brokers had claimed was used by NSA intelligence operatives to sneak into Windows PCs.  ""Clearly people who run supported versions of Windows and patched quickly were not affected"", Trustwave's Mador said.  Microsoft has faced criticism since 2014 for withdrawing support for older versions of Windows software such as 16-year-old Windows XP and requiring users to pay hefty annual fees instead. The British government canceled a nationwide NHS support contract with Microsoft after a year, leaving upgrades to local trusts.  Seeking to head off further criticism in the wake of the WannaCry outbreak, the U.S. software giant last weekend released a free patch for Windows XP and other older Windows versions that it previously only offered to paying customers.(reut.rs/2qvSPUR)      Microsoft declined to comment for this story.   On Sunday, the U.S. software giant called on intelligence services to strike a better balance between their desire to keep software flaws secret - in order to conduct espionage and cyber warfare - and sharing those flaws with technology companies to better secure the internet (reut.rs/2qAOdLm).  Half of all internet addresses corrupted globally by WannaCry are located in China and Russia, with 30 and 20 percent respectively. Infection levels spiked again in both countries this week and remained high through Thursday, according to data supplied to Reuters by threat intelligence firm Kryptos Logic.  By contrast, the United States accounts for 7 percent of WannaCry infections while Britain, France and Germany each represent just 2 percent of worldwide attacks, Kryptos said.(tmsnrt.rs/2qIUckv)  The ransomware mixes copycat software loaded with amateur coding mistakes and recently leaked spy tools widely believed to have been stolen from the U.S. National Security Agency, creating a vastly potent class of crimeware.  ""What really makes the magnitude of this attack so much greater than any other is that the intent has changed from information stealing to business disruption"", said Samil Neino, 32, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Kryptos Logic.  Last Friday, the company's British-based 22-year-old data breach research chief, Marcus Hutchins, created a ""kill-switch"", which security experts have widely hailed as the decisive step in halting the ransomware's rapid spread around the globe.  WannaCry appears to target mainly enterprises rather than consumers: Once it infects one machine, it silently proliferates across internal networks which can connect hundreds or thousands of machines in large firms, unlike individual consumers at home.   An unknown number of computers sit behind the 300,000 infected internet connections identified by Kryptos.   Because of the way WannaCry spreads sneakily inside organization networks, a far larger total of ransomed computers sitting behind company firewalls may be hit, possibly numbering upward of a million machines. The company is crunching data to arrive at a firmer estimate it aims to release later Thursday.  Liran Eshel, chief executive of cloud storage provider CTERA Networks, said: ""The attack shows how sophisticated ransomware has become, forcing even unaffected organizations to rethink strategies.""  Researchers from a variety of security firms say they have so far failed to find a way to decrypt files locked up by WannaCry and say chances are low anyone will succeed.  However, a bug in WannaCry code means the attackers cannot use unique bitcoin addresses to track payments, security researchers at Symantec found this week. The result: ""Users unlikely to get files restored"", the company's Security Response team tweeted.  The rapid recovery by many organizations with unpatched computers caught out by the attack may largely be attributed to back-up and retrieval procedures they had in place, enabling technicians to re-image infected machines, experts said.  While encrypting individual computers it infects, WannaCry code does not attack network data-backup systems, as more sophisticated ransomware packages typically do, security experts who have studied WannaCry code agree.  These factors help explain the mystery of why such a tiny number of victims appear to have paid ransoms into the three bitcoin accounts to which WannaCry directs victims.  Less than 300 payments worth around $83,000 had been paid into WannaCry blackmail accounts by Thursday (1800 GMT), six days after the attack began and one day before the ransomware threatens to start locking up victim computers forever. (Reuters graphic: [tmsnrt.rs/2rqaLyz)  The Verizon 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report, the most comprehensive annual survey of security breakdowns, found that it takes three months before at least half of organizations install major new software security patches.  WannaCry landed nine weeks after Microsoft's patch arrived.  ""The same things are causing the same problems. That's what the data shows,"" MWR research head Pratley said.  ""We haven't seen many organizations fall over and that's because they did some of the security basics,"" he said.  For a graphic on WannaCry worm, click here "

""What really makes the magnitude of this attack so much greater than any other is that the intent has changed from information stealing to business disruption"", said Salim Neino, 32, chief executive of Los Angeles-based Kryptos Logic.  Last Friday, the company's British-based 22-year-old data breach research chief, Marcus Hutchins, created a ""kill-switch"", which security experts have widely hailed as the decisive step in halting the ransomware's rapid spread around the globe.  WannaCry appears to target mainly enterprises rather than consumers: Once it infects one machine, it silently proliferates across internal networks which can connect hundreds or thousands of machines in large firms, unlike individual consumers at home.  An unknown number of computers sit behind the 300,000 infected internet connections identified by Kryptos.  Because of the way WannaCry spreads sneakily inside organisation networks, a far larger total of ransomed computers sitting behind company firewalls may be hit, possibly numbering upward of a million machines. The company is crunching data to arrive at a firmer estimate it aims to release later Thursday.  Liran Eshel, chief executive of cloud storage provider CTERA Networks, said: ""The attack shows how sophisticated ransomware has become, forcing even unaffected organisations to rethink strategies.""  Researchers from a variety of security firms say they have so far failed to find a way to decrypt files locked up by WannaCry and say chances are low anyone will succeed.  However, a bug in WannaCry code means the attackers cannot use unique bitcoin addresses to track payments, security researchers at Symantec found this week. The result: ""Users unlikely to get files restored"", the company's Security Response team tweeted.  The rapid recovery by many organisations with unpatched computers caught out by the attack may largely be attributed to back-up and retrieval procedures they had in place, enabling technicians to re-image infected machines, experts said.  While encrypting individual computers it infects, WannaCry code does not attack network data-backup systems, as more sophisticated ransomware packages typically do, security experts who have studied WannaCry code agree.  These factors help explain the mystery of why such a tiny number of victims appear to have paid ransoms into the three bitcoin accounts to which WannaCry directs victims.  Less than 300 payments worth around $83,000 had been paid into WannaCry blackmail accounts by Thursday (1800 GMT), six days after the attack began and one day before the ransomware threatens to start locking up victim computers forever. (Reuters graphic: [tmsnrt.rs/2rqaLyz)  The Verizon 2017 Data Breach Investigations Report, the most comprehensive annual survey of security breakdowns, found that it takes three months before at least half of organisations install major new software security patches.  WannaCry landed nine weeks after Microsoft's patch arrived.  ""The same things are causing the same problems. That's what the data shows,"" MWR research head Pratley said.  ""We haven't seen many organisations fall over and that's because they did some of the security basics,"" he said. "
"May 23, 2017 /  2:00 PM / 2 months ago",Fidelity to allow clients to see digital currencies on website,Anna Irrera & Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/fidelity-bitcoin-idUSL1N1IO1PO,"NEW YORK, May 23 (Reuters) - Fidelity Investments will allow its clients to see their holdings of bitcoin and other virtual currencies held on digital asset exchange Coinbase on the company's website, said Chief Executive Abigail Johnson on Tuesday.  The move will make the Boston-based asset manager one of a handful of large financial services firms to have integrated digital currencies into its website.  A Fidelity spokesman said the new initiative may be launched in the second or third quarter this year.  The company is testing the Coinbase holdings integration with its employees, Johnson said.  ""I love this stuff – bitcoin, ethereum, blockchain technology – and what the future holds,"" Johnson said at a blockchain conference called Consensus in New York City.  Blockchain, a shared online ledger of transactions which first emerged as bitcoin's underlying technology, has been attracting growing investments by established financial institutions which hope it can help them save money and time.  Ethereum, a type of blockchain technology which can be used to build more complex applications, has also garnered interest from mainstream corporations.  Most large financial services firms have so far steered clear of virtual currencies. Fidelity is one of a few traditional investment companies to have also openly backed the digital currency.  ""We have built proofs of concepts that accept bitcoin micro-transactions,"" Johnson said. ""We set up small bitcoin and ethereum mining operations, just done in the spirit of learning.""  Bitcoin hit a record high on Monday, with one unit of bitcoin trading above $2,2000 on the Bitstamp platform .  Fidelity has also been testing bitcoin internally by allowing it in its cafeteria, though fewer than 100 employees made purchases using the virtual currencies, Johnson added.  The Fidelity chief executive noted that usability was slowing down adoption.  ""If you are looking for bitcoin to beat Visa at the point of sale today, you are going to be disappointed, Johnson said. ""If you are looking at this technology as just a faster settlement system for financial transactions ... also disappointing.""  The asset manager still has faith in virtual currencies, she added. ""But I am still a believer – and it's no accident that I'm one of the few standing before you today from a large financial services firm that hasn't given up on digital currencies,"" Johnson said.  The company has also been investing in blockchain and has backed software company Axoni. (Reporting by Anna Irrera; Editing by Bill Rigby)"
"May 23, 2017 /  12:49 PM / in 2 months","BofA, HSBC, Intel, others invest $107 million in blockchain startup R3",Anna Irrera,http://www.reuters.com/article/r3-cev-blockchain-fundraising-idUSL1N1IO1FW,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Financial and technology companies led by Bank of America Corp, SBI Holdings Inc, HSBC Holdings Plc, Intel Corp and Temasek Holdings have invested $107 million in R3 CEV, a startup which runs a big bank consortium seeking to develop blockchain technology, it said on Tuesday.  Over 40 institutions from more than 15 countries participated in the first two tranches of the New York company's fundraising round, making it one of the largest investments in a blockchain company to date, R3 said in a statement.   The third and final tranche will open later this year.  Other major investors and companies leading the deal include ING Groep NV, Banco Bradesco SA, Itaú Unibanco SA, Natixis SA, Barclays Plc, UBS Group AG and Wells Fargo & Co, R3 said.  R3 launched in September 2015 with the backing of nine of the world's largest investment banks seeking to make their operations more efficient with new technology, and its membership has rapidly grown to about 80 financial institutions.  It aims to raise $150 million from members and strategic investors, and give them a 60 percent stake.  An R3 spokesman declined to disclose the company's valuation.  Blockchain, best known as the system underpinning digital currency bitcoin, is a public online ledger of transactions maintained by a network of computers on the internet. Financial firms hope that the nascent technology can reduce the cost and complexity of burdensome processes such as international payments and securities settlement.  The completion of the first two tranches follows the departure of several large banks from R3 over the past few months, including JPMorgan Chase & Co, Goldman Sachs Group Inc Banco Santander SA and Morgan Stanley  The banks have internal blockchain projects or investments in other similar startups.  State Street Corp has also left the group, the R3 spokesman added.  ""This year we will have pilot projects and early production phase products in the market,"" R3 Chief Executive David Rutter said in an interview. But ""we are a couple of years away until we see massively impactful products,"" he added.   Skeptics have warned that it might take many years for the financial industry to reap significant benefits from blockchain.  ""Distributed ledger technology is well suited for some uses case but it will not be the answer for everything,"" Kaushalya Somasundaram, head of fintech partnerships and strategy at HSBC, said in an interview.

"May 22, 2017 /  11:08 PM / 2 months ago",Symantec says 'highly likely' North Korea group behind ransomware attacks,Joseph Menn,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-attack-northkorea-idUSL1N1IO1Y5,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Cyber security firm Symantec Corp (SYMC.O) said on Monday it was ""highly likely"" a hacking group affiliated with North Korea was behind the WannaCry cyber attack this month that infected more than 300,000 computers worldwide and disrupted hospitals, banks and schools across the globe.  Symantec researchers said they had found multiple instances of code that had been used both in the North Korea-linked group's previous activity and in early versions of WannaCry.  In addition, the same Internet connection was used to install an early version of WannaCry on two computers and to communicate with a tool that destroyed files at Sony Pictures Entertainment. The U.S. government and private companies have accused North Korea in the 2014 Sony attack.  North Korea has routinely denied any such role. On Monday, it called earlier reports that it might have been behind the WannaCry attack ""a dirty and despicable smear campaign.""  Lazarus is the name many security companies have given to the hacking group behind the Sony attack and others. By custom, Symantec does not attribute cyber campaigns directly to governments, but its researchers did not dispute the common belief that Lazarus works for North Korea.  In a blog post, Symantec listed numerous links between Lazarus and software the group had left behind after launching an earlier, less virulent, version of the malware in February. One was a variant of software used to wipe disks during the Sony Pictures attack, while another tool used the same internet addresses as two other pieces of malware linked to Lazarus.   At the same time, flaws in the WannaCry code, its wide spread, and its demands for payment in the electronic bitcoin before files are decrypted suggest that the hackers were not working for North Korean government objectives in this case, said Vikram Thakur, Symantec's security response technical director.  ""Our confidence is very high that this is the work of people associated with the Lazarus Group, because they had to have source code access,"" Thakur said in an interview.  But he added: ""We don't think that this is an operation run by a nation-state.""  With WannaCry, Thakur said, Lazarus Group members could have been moonlighting to make extra money, or they could have left government service, or they could have been contractors without direct obligations to serve only the government.  The most effective version of WannaCry spread by using a flaw in Microsoft's Windows and a program that took advantage of it that had been used by the U.S. National Security Agency, officials said privately.  That program was among a batch leaked or stolen and then dumped online by a group calling itself The Shadow Brokers, who some in U.S. intelligence believe to be affiliated with Russia.   Analysts have been weighing in with various theories on the identity of those behind WannaCry, and some early evidence had pointed to North Korea. The Shadow Brokers endorsed that theory, perhaps to take heat off their own government backers for the disaster.     Cybersecurity company Kaspersky has said it had found several similarities between the WannaCry malware from the earlier attack and those used by Lazarus. But in an interview last week, its Asia research director, Vitaly Kamluk, said it was not conclusive evidence. ""It's unusual,"" he said.    Beau Woods, deputy director of the Cyber Statecraft Initiative at the Atlantic Council, said that the Korean language used in some versions of the WannaCry ransom note was not that of a native speaker, making a Lazarus connection unlikely.  But Thakur said that some hackers deliberately obfuscate their language to make tracing them harder. It is also possible that the writer in question was a contractor in another country, he said.  Thakur said a less likely scenario is that Lazarus' main aim was to create chaos by distributing WannaCry.  If the hackers' main objective was to earn money on the side, that would suggest an undisciplined hacking operation run by North Korea, one that could be exploited and weakened by the country's many foes.  ""The intelligence community will probably take away from this that there is a possibility of splinters in the Lazarus Group, or members who are interested in filling their own pockets, and that could help,"" Thakur said.  Lazarus has also been linked to attacks on banks using their SWIFT messaging network. Last year, hackers stole $81 million from Bangladesh's central bank. Symantec said malware used in that attack was linked to Lazarus.  "
"May 23, 2017 /  12:35 AM / 2 months ago","Commodity traders, banks face hard realities with game-changing blockchain",Eric Onstad,http://www.reuters.com/article/commodities-blockchain-idUSL1N1IP01K,"LONDON (Reuters) - Alistair Cross was flying high after showing in a pilot project how blockchain - the technology first developed for the crypto-currency bitcoin - could transform the old-fashioned and secretive world of commodity trading.  But since the pilot ran early this year, Cross and his rivals have hit some hard realities as they try to propel their industry into the digital age at last.  Word spread fast through the business when Mercuria, the Swiss-based commodities house where Cross is head of operations, successfully tested an oil trade. ""The number of phone calls I've had from people in the last month once they heard we had done this has been incredible,"" he told Reuters.  Cross and many others in the sector are excited about the possibility of saving billions of dollars a year in commodities trading by scrapping millions of paper documents and moving to a digital equivalent with blockchain.  FACTBOX: Who's doing what with blockchain in commodities:  But adopting some form of blockchain, which in the case of bitcoin allows for transactions through a peer-to-peer computer network, with no need for middlemen, wouldn't be universally welcomed. Many in the conservative commodity business shrink from the thought of losing discretion in their dealings, as well as jobs and perhaps even their business if the technology succeeds disrupting the status quo.  After a series of upbeat announcements from Mercuria and others about successful pilots and ""proofs of concept"", Cross and rivals have found that translating enthusiasm into a broad-based roll-out of the technology is proving difficult.  Even if problems in the blockchain technology are ironed out, the sector has to hammer out common legal standards, ensure there are links between different dealing platforms and persuade scattered elements of the supply chain - from commodity producers and brokers to traders and consumers - to co-operate.  For Cross, the fear is that a profusion of systems will emerge. ""There's got to be consolidation in all this because if everyone comes up with their own offering it will be too burdensome, it will kill itself,"" he said.  Long after stock, currency and bond trading moved to electronic systems, the business of buying and selling commodities is largely stuck in an era of paper and fax machines.  ""When you start to think about some of the (possible) efficiencies in that environment, it's astronomical,"" said Guy Halford-Thompson, CEO of BTL Group, a technology firm that is running a blockchain pilot with European energy companies.  Whether it is trading oil, copper or wheat, participants currently grapple with a mountain of documents including letters of credit, bills of lading and inventory receipts.  For instance, more than 4.5 million letters of credit were issued in 2015, accounting for over $2 trillion of global trade, according to HSBC. Blockchain has the potential to eliminate all this kind of paper and much more.  Shaving only part of the costs from such a huge volume of trade could amount to billions of dollars in gains for firms across the supply chain.  Mercuria has estimated that costs in terms of payments could slide by 30 percent by using the technology.  Eager to turn the concept into reality, HSBC completed a test run last year along with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, proving that a letter of credit could be replicated on a distributed ledger.  The test, while successful, also revealed the tough road ahead. ""We learned that it could be done, but there were quite a few restrictions with the technology itself... particularly around the scalability and security,"" said Vivek Ramachandran, global head of product for HSBC's trade finance business.  HSBC is now working with another broader group of banks and technology firms to move the project forward.  Ramachandran believes the technology will eventually transform the sector, but it will be tough convincing a wide range of market participants to set aside rivalries and move onto a blockchain platform.  Some in a fiercely competitive commodities sector are reluctant to put their data on a common platform.  ""If you're a proprietary trader with your specific strategies that make you a lot of money, you're not in the business of sharing that with anybody,"" said Talib Dhanji, EY's Commodities Markets Leader.  Blockchain technology allows for public, private and mixed platforms, but to reap the benefits, the whole supply chain including producers, shippers, warehouse operators and customs authorities must use it.  Technology giant IBM recognises the difficulty of moving beyond a pilot of trading crude oil that it has tested with French bank Natixis and trading house Trafigura. ""Clearly it needs a number of banks and a number of buyers and sellers, enough to get a critical mass to make a business network valid,"" said Keith Bear, IBM's vice president of financial markets.  Even among commodity and technology partners working on blockchain projects, there is reluctance to share information.  ""You don't want to give away your intellectual property or your market knowledge, access to clients, to fintech companies for the privilege of paying for that technology for the rest of your life,"" said Kris Van Broekhoven, global head of commodity trade finance for Citibank. ""So it's not an easy discussion.""  In some cases, people may be wary of joining an initiative that may render their roles redundant. Banks, brokers and energy utilities could all face uncertain futures in a world where the buyer and seller can do business directly in a digital system.  ""Once you have the transparency, the visibility, the digital trust...it means a challenge to the value that they add to that process,"" said Richard Payne, managing director of commodities trading and risk management at Accenture Resources.  While banks will still be needed to provide finance, their role is likely to change, while some energy companies and brokers may find themselves squeezed out.  In the pilot, Mercuria completed an oil trade using a digital ""smart contract"" on a blockchain instead of a letter of credit. ""With paper flow, it takes 10 to 20-plus days to get the documentation in order, and we did it in two days, so it's not a stretch to imagine that the working capital cycle can leverage much more effectively,"" said Cross.  Still, a legal basis must be created for digital contracts and regulators have to grant their approval for a technology that was originally created by radical libertarians who sought to disrupt the established economic system with bitcoin.  Central bank regulators, already unable to control bitcoin business, are cautious. ""They're very, very interested...(but) they are rightly nervous,"" Peter Stephens, head of blockchain at UBS, told a conference. ""They will have to take this very gradually.""  In the United States the acting head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in January that distributed ledger technology offered promising benefits as long as regulators can ensure it will ""do no harm"".  Despite the obstacles, once a critical mass is hit, the pace of transforming commodities with blockchain is likely to quicken, Cross said.  ""There's going to come a time that from the wellhead to the gas tank, the physical production to the administrative will not be touched by humans. It’s happening and we need to get on board."""

Mercuria has estimated that costs in terms of payments could slide by 30 percent by using the technology.  Eager to turn the concept into reality, HSBC completed a test run last year along with Bank of America Merrill Lynch and the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore, proving that a letter of credit could be replicated on a distributed ledger.  The test, while successful, also revealed the tough road ahead. ""We learned that it could be done, but there were quite a few restrictions with the technology itself... particularly around the scalability and security,"" said Vivek Ramachandran, global head of product for HSBC's trade finance business.  HSBC is now working with another broader group of banks and technology firms to move the project forward.   Ramachandran believes the technology will eventually transform the sector, but it will be tough convincing a wide range of market participants to set aside rivalries and move onto a blockchain platform.  Some in a fiercely competitive commodities sector are reluctant to put their data on a common platform.  ""If you're a proprietary trader with your specific strategies that make you a lot of money, you're not in the business of sharing that with anybody,"" said Talib Dhanji, EY's Commodities Markets Leader.  Blockchain technology allows for public, private and mixed platforms, but to reap the benefits, the whole supply chain including producers, shippers, warehouse operators and customs authorities must use it.  Technology giant IBM recognizes the difficulty of moving beyond a pilot of trading crude oil that it has tested with French bank Natixis and trading house Trafigura. ""Clearly it needs a number of banks and a number of buyers and sellers, enough to get a critical mass to make a business network valid,"" said Keith Bear, IBM's vice president of financial markets.  Even among commodity and technology partners working on blockchain projects, there is reluctance to share information.  ""You don't want to give away your intellectual property or your market knowledge, access to clients, to fintech companies for the privilege of paying for that technology for the rest of your life,"" said Kris Van Broekhoven, global head of commodity trade finance for Citibank. ""So it's not an easy discussion.""      In some cases, people may be wary of joining an initiative that may render their roles redundant. Banks, brokers and energy utilities could all face uncertain futures in a world where the buyer and seller can do business directly in a digital system.  ""Once you have the transparency, the visibility, the digital trust...it means a challenge to the value that they add to that process,"" said Richard Payne, managing director of commodities trading and risk management at Accenture Resources.       While banks will still be needed to provide finance, their role is likely to change, while some energy companies and brokers may find themselves squeezed out.      In the pilot, Mercuria completed an oil trade using a digital ""smart contract"" on a blockchain instead of a letter of credit. ""With paper flow, it takes 10 to 20-plus days to get the documentation in order, and we did it in two days, so it's not a stretch to imagine that the working capital cycle can leverage much more effectively,"" said Cross.  Still, a legal basis must be created for digital contracts and regulators have to grant their approval for a technology that was originally created by radical libertarians who sought to disrupt the established economic system with bitcoin.  Central bank regulators, already unable to control bitcoin business, are cautious. ""They're very, very interested...(but) they are rightly nervous,"" Peter Stephens, head of blockchain at UBS, told a conference. ""They will have to take this very gradually.""  In the United States the acting head of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said in January that distributed ledger technology offered promising benefits as long as regulators can ensure it will ""do no harm"".  Despite the obstacles, once a critical mass is hit, the pace of transforming commodities with blockchain is likely to quicken, Cross said.  ""There's going to come a time that from the wellhead to the gas tank, the physical production to the administrative will not be touched by humans. It’s happening and we need to get on board.""  (The story corrects 16th paragraph to show HSBC did not work with R3, but with the Infocomm Development Authority of Singapore) "

"May 19, 2017 /  8:02 PM / 2 months ago",Companies use kidnap insurance to guard against ransomware attacks,Suzanne Barlyn & Carolyn Cohn,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-attack-insurance-idUSL2N1IL1OL,"NEW YORK/LONDON (Reuters) - Companies without cyber insurance are dusting off policies covering kidnap, ransom and extortion in the world's political hotspots to recoup losses caused by ransomware viruses such as ""WannaCry"", insurers say.  Cyber insurance can be expensive to buy and is not widely used outside the United States, with one insurer previously describing the cost as $100,000 for $10 million in data breach insurance.  Some companies do not even consider it because they do not think they are targets.  The kidnap policies, known as K&R coverage, are typically used by multinational companies looking to protect their staff in areas where violence related to oil and mining operations is common, such as parts of Africa and Latin America.  Companies could also tap them to cover losses following the WannaCry attack, which used malicious software, known as ransomware, to lock up more than 200,000 computers in more than 150 countries, and demand payments to free them up.  Pay-outs on K&R for ransomware attacks may be lower and the policies less suitable than those offered by traditional cyber insurance, insurers say.  ""There will be some creative forensic lawyers who will be looking at policies,"" said Patrick Gage, chief underwriting officer at CNA Hardy, a specialist commercial insurer, in London.  He added, however, that given that K&R policies are geared towards a threat to lives, ""our absolute preference is that people buy specific cover, rather than relying on insurance coverage that is not specific"".  American International Group Inc, Hiscox Ltd and the Travelers Companies Inc have been receiving ransomware claims from some customers with K&R policies as ransomware attacks become more common, the companies said.  The insurers declined to comment on total claims, citing confidentiality and client security concerns.  ""We are seeing claims (over the past 18 months) but not a huge uptick,"" a Hiscox spokeswoman said. ""These are within expectations and entirely manageable.""  She declined to say whether the firm had seen any such claims from the WannaCry attacks though Tom Harvey, an expert in cyber risk management at catastrophe modelling firm RMS, said ""insurers with kidnap and ransom books will want to look closely at their policy wordings to see whether they are exposed.""  A sharp rise in ransomware attacks in the past 18 months has driven companies to use K&R policies to cover some of their damages if they do not have direct cyber coverage or cannot meet initial cyber policy deductible costs, insurers said.  Symantec Corp,, a cyber security firm based in Mountain View in California, observed over 460,000 ransomware attempts in 2016, up 36 percent from 2015, the company said. The average payment demand ballooned from $294 to $1,077, a 266 percent increase.  But as the threat mounts, K&R insurers are at risk from steeper claims than they had anticipated. They are responding by making changes to their policies, which were not designed around ransomware, insurance brokers said.  Most of the computers affected by WannaCry were outside the United States, where companies have been slow to buy cyber insurance. Nearly 90 percent of the world's annual cyber insurance premium of $2.5-3 billion comes from the U.S. market, according to insurance broker Aon Plc.  Global companies typically buy K&R policies without ransomware in mind. But instances of high-tech hacks and online ransom demands can hit a company’s business more than an executive being held hostage.  ""If your CFO (chief financial officer) gets kidnapped, the company is going to continue to function,"" said Bob Parisi, cyber product leader for insurance broker Marsh, a subsidiary of Marsh & McLennan Companies Inc.  ""If you get a piece of malware in the system, you might have two factories that stop working. The actual damage is probably greater.""  The K&R policies, which typically do not have deductibles, cover the ransom payments as well as crisis response services, including getting in touch with criminal and regulatory authorities, said Kevin Kalinich, global head of Aon's cyber risk practice.  Still, K&R policies may provide only a quick fix since they were not designed for ransomware. Companies can add coverage for business interruption, but the upper limits for pay-outs are usually lower than for a cyber policy, insurers say.  K&R insurers have been adapting to ransomware-related claims - some are modernizing coverage by setting up Bitcoin accounts for clients to speed up ransom payments, brokers said.  But insurers are mindful of their own risks.  Some have added deductibles, said Anthony Dagostino, head of global cyber risk at Willis Towers Watson PLC advisory and brokerage.  AIG has reduced business interruption coverage for K&R policies to a $1 million maximum for cyber extortion events.  ""Insurers didn't anticipate there would be this much ransomware activity,"" said Tracie Grella, global head of cyber risk insurance at AIG."
"May 18, 2017 /  9:08 PM / 2 months ago",Blockchain token sale nets $25 million in under 15 minutes,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-aragon-blockchain-funding-idUSKCN18E32X,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Aragon, a project that creates software to manage companies, has raised $25 million in under 15 minutes late on Wednesday with the sale of its own token, said Luis Cuende, the project's co-founder.  The proceeds were the second-largest amount received by a start-up operating in the blockchain or distributed ledger space, Cuende said. Aragon's coin is called Aragon Network Token.  Cuende, 21, said Aragon is the first management tool developed specifically to decentralize the creation and maintenance of companies around the world.   Aragon was built on ethereum, a public blockchain similar to bitcoin's.  Aragon requires only the internet to function, implementing basic features such as governance, fundraising, payroll and accounting.  ""What we make is software for people to organize themselves and run businesses using blockchain technology,"" said Cuende.   ""They don't have to interact with banks or lawyers if they don't want to. They can be in the field of service they want and they don't have to do all these requirements.""  Cuende, who started his first software project at age 12, did not expect the offering to raise that much money for Aragon.  ""If you had asked me two months ago, $25 million was like five times what I was dreaming of,"" Cuende said in an interview.  The largest funding raised in a so-called ""initial coin offering"" (ICO) was  $150 million in May 2016 by a blockchain solutions company called Slock.it for The DAO, a crowd-funded venture capital fund.   Aragon is one of numerous blockchain start-ups and projects that have raised capital by creating their own tokens or digital currencies and selling them to the public through ICOs.  With the funds raised, Aragon will focus on further developing its software, implementing security audits and hiring additional developers and operational staff, bringing the team to 10 people this year.

"May 18, 2017 /  6:46 PM / 2 months ago",CORRECTED-Security experts find clues to ransomware worm's lingering risks,,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-attack-failures-idUSL8N1IK5P0,"(Corrects company name in fifth paragraph of May 18 report)  * WannaCry infections still at high levels in China, Russia-report  * Ransomware crashes old Windows versions, limiting spread-experts  * Global attack disproportionately targets Windows 7 users-BitSight  * Failure to heed patch warnings; turn off unneeded apps blamed  By Eric Auchard  FRANKFURT, May 19 (Reuters) - Two-thirds of those caught up in the past week's global ransomware attack were running Microsoft's Windows 7 operating system without the latest security updates, a survey for Reuters by security ratings firm BitSight found.  Researchers are struggling to try to find early traces of WannaCry, which remains an active threat in hardest-hit China and Russia, believing that identifying ""patient zero"" could help catch its criminal authors.  They are having more luck dissecting flaws that limited its spread.  Security experts warn that while computers at more than 300,000 internet addresses were hit by the ransomware strain, further attacks that fix weaknesses in WannaCry will follow that hit larger numbers of users, with more devastating consequences.  ""Some organisations just aren't aware of the risks; some don't want to risk interrupting important business processes; sometimes they are short-staffed,"" said Ziv Mador, vice president of security research at Trustwave’s Israeli SpiderLabs unit.  ""There are plenty of reasons people wait to patch and none of them are good,"" said Mador, a former long-time security researcher for Microsoft.  WannaCry's worm-like capacity to infect other computers on the same network with no human intervention appear tailored to Windows 7, said Paul Pratley, head of investigations & incident response at UK consulting firm MWR InfoSecurity.  Data from BitSight covering 160,000 internet-connected computers hit by WannaCry, shows that Windows 7 accounts for 67 percent of infections, although it represents less than half of the global distribution of Windows PC users.  Computers running older versions, such as Windows XP used in Britain's NHS health system, while individually vulnerable to attack, appear incapable of spreading infections and played a far smaller role in the global attack than initially reported.  In laboratory testing, researchers at MWR and Kyptos say they have found Windows XP crashes before the virus can spread.  Windows 10, the latest version of Microsoft's flagship operating system franchise, accounts for another 15 percent, while older versions of Windows including 8.1, 8, XP and Vista, account for the remainder, BitSight estimated.  Any organisation which heeded strongly worded warnings from Microsoft to urgently install a security patch it labelled “critical” when it was released on March 14 on all computers on their networks are immune, experts agree.  Those hit by WannaCry also failed to heed warnings last year from Microsoft to disable a file sharing feature in Windows known as SMB, which a covert hacker group calling itself Shadow Brokers had claimed was used by NSA intelligence operatives to sneak into Windows PCs.  ""Clearly people who run supported versions of Windows and patched quickly were not affected"", Trustwave's Mador said.  Microsoft has faced criticism since 2014 for withdrawing support for older versions of Windows software such as 16-year-old Windows XP and requiring users to pay hefty annual fees instead. The British government cancelled a nationwide NHS support contract with Microsoft after a year, leaving upgrades to local trusts.

Half of all internet addresses corrupted globally by WannaCry are located in China and Russia, with 30 and 20 percent respectively. Infection levels spiked again in both countries this week and remained high through Thursday, according to data supplied to Reuters by threat intelligence firm Kryptos Logic.

Last Friday, the company's British-based 22-year-old data breach research chief, Marcus Hutchins, created a ""kill-switch"", which security experts have widely hailed as the decisive step in halting the ransomware's rapid spread around the globe.  WannaCry appears to target mainly enterprises rather than consumers: Once it infects one machine, it silently proliferates across internal networks which can connect hundreds or thousands of machines in large firms, unlike individual consumers at home.  An unknown number of computers sit behind the 300,000 infected internet connections identified by Kryptos.  Because of the way WannaCry spreads sneakily inside organisation networks, a far larger total of ransomed computers sitting behind company firewalls may be hit, possibly numbering upward of a million machines. The company is crunching data to arrive at a firmer estimate it aims to release later Thursday.  Liran Eshel, chief executive of cloud storage provider CTERA Networks, said: ""The attack shows how sophisticated ransomware has become, forcing even unaffected organisations to rethink strategies.""  Researchers from a variety of security firms say they have so far failed to find a way to decrypt files locked up by WannaCry and say chances are low anyone will succeed.

The result: ""Users unlikely to get files restored"", the company's Security Response team tweeted.  The rapid recovery by many organisations with unpatched computers caught out by the attack may largely be attributed to back-up and retrieval procedures they had in place, enabling technicians to re-image infected machines, experts said.  While encrypting individual computers it infects, WannaCry code does not attack network data-backup systems, as more sophisticated ransomware packages typically do, security experts who have studied WannaCry code agree.  These factors help explain the mystery of why such a tiny number of victims appear to have paid ransoms into the three bitcoin accounts to which WannaCry directs victims.  Less than 300 payments worth around $83,000 had been paid into WannaCry blackmail accounts by Thursday (1800 GMT), six days after the attack began and one day before the ransomware threatens to start locking up victim computers forever.

Researchers are struggling to try to find early traces of WannaCry, which remains an active threat in hardest-hit China and Russia, believing that identifying ""patient zero"" could help catch its criminal authors.  They are having more luck dissecting flaws that limited its spread.   Security experts warn that while computers at more than 300,000 internet addresses were hit by the ransomware strain, further attacks that fix weaknesses in WannaCry will follow that hit larger numbers of users, with more devastating consequences.

MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS slipped 0.2 percent, on track for a weekly loss of 0.5 percent.  Japan's Nikkei .N225 was almost 0.1 percent higher, headed for a decline of 1.6 percent for the week.   MSCI's emerging markets index .MSCIEF extended losses by 0.2 percent on Friday. It posted its lowest close in two weeks on Thursday, dragged down by an 8.8 percent slump in Brazilian stocks .BVSP, on a report that President Michel Temer supported an attempt to pay a potential witness to remain silent in the country's biggest-ever graft probe.  The Brazilian real BRL= was fractionally firmer at 3.3685 per dollar early on Friday, after an 8.5 percent plunge to its lowest level since December on Thursday.   Wall Street bounced back overnight from its worst sell-off in more than eight months, taking solace in the appointment of former FBI chief Robert Mueller to investigate alleged Russian interference in the presidential election and possible collusion between U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign and Moscow.  The Dow .DJI gained 0.3 percent, while Nasdaq .IXIC was up 0.7 percent.    ""We could be just shaking off the jitters here. Yesterday, investors were really worried,"" said Janna Sampson, co-chief investment officer at OakBrook Investments LLC in Lisle, Illinois.  ""Whatever the (investigation) result, people feel they might have confidence it's an accurate, unbiased result,"" she said.  Investors will watch with renewed focus next week's testimony to the Senate by former FBI Director James Comey. Comey's firing by Trump last week set off the political firestorm and culminated on Wednesday in the Justice Department's appointment of a special counsel to probe possible ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign.  Strong economic indicators from the U.S. also gave support to markets and helped lift the dollar 0.6 percent overnight, but it showed little change on Friday morning, trading around 111.42 yen JPY= and was set for a 1.7 percent slide over the week.   Data showed a sharp acceleration in factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region in May, and an unexpected drop in new applications for unemployment benefits.  The dollar index, which tracks the greenback against a basket of six major peers, was also steady at 97.83, after gaining 0.3 percent on Thursday. It's set to end the week 1.4 percent lower.   Sterling GBP= inched up 0.1 percent to $1.2952.   On Thursday, it broke through $1.30 for the first time in almost eight months after data showed better-than-expected British retail sales growth that helped ease concerns about the broader economy. But it fell back down on technical selling to close 0.2 percent lower.   The euro EUR=EBS was little changed on Friday. It touched a nine-month high on Thursday but surrendered the gains as the dollar advanced.   In commodities, oil prices continued their gains for the third straight session on optimism that producers will agree to rein in output for longer in order to soak up a global glut.  U.S. crude CLc1 rose 0.2 percent to $49.46 a barrel, and was poised to end the week 3.4 percent higher.   Gold inched higher, clawing back some of Thursday's losses. Spot gold XAU= added 0.2 percent to $1,248.76, set to post a weekly gain of 1.7 percent.  "
"May 19, 2017 /  6:01 AM / 2 months ago",RPT-Bitcoin's murkier rivals line up to displace it as cybercriminals' favourite,,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-attack-bitcoin-idUSL8N1IK6H3,"(Repeats story unchanged)  * Bitcoin's size accounts for popularity among cybercriminals  * Those who do not take extra steps can be traced  * Next-generation cryptocurrencies more secure, still small  By Jemima Kelly  LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Bitcoin is well-entrenched as the preferred payment for cybercriminals like the WannaCry hackers who have hit more than 300,000 computers over the past week, but cryptocurrencies offering more anonymity are threatening to displace it.  A key reason for bitcoin's dominance in the nefarious online underworld, say technologists and cybercrime experts, is its size - the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is more than twice that of the nearest of hundreds of rivals.  That makes it easy for victims to access enough to pay the ransoms demanded, and for hackers to cash out of it via online exchanges to spend money in the real world.  Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by someone - or some group - calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.  Money is sent from one anonymous online ""wallet"" to another with no need for a third party to validate or clear the transactions.  In the WannaCry attack, the addresses of three anonymous bitcoin wallets were given to victims, with a demand for ransom payments from $300 worth of bitcoin, with a promise the affected machines would be decrypted in return, a promise that no evidence has shown will be kept.  But since the way that Bitcoin functions is via the blockchain - a giant, virtually tamper-proof, shared ledger of all bitcoin transactions ever made - payments can be traced, if users do not have the sophistication to take further steps to cloak themselves using digital anonymity tools.  ""In the initial days of bitcoin, people...didn’t realise they were recording for posterity on the blockchain every financial transaction that ever took place,"" said Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University.  Bitcoin addresses are anonymous, but users can be traced through IP addresses or by analysing money flows.  If criminals using bitcoin want to stay truly anonymous, Gun Sirer said, they have to go through a number of additional, complex steps to make sure they do not get caught.  It is not yet clear what level of sophistication the WannaCry hackers have when it comes to laundering their cryptocurrency, as none of the money has yet been moved out of the three bitcoin wallets linked to the ransomware, which have had over $80,000 worth of bitcoin paid into them so far. [tmsnrt.rs/2rqaLyz ]  But some have suggested that the fact that the WannaCry hackers demanded bitcoin shows how amateur they are.  ""If it was me, I would want people to use bitcoin all day, because you can trace it,"" said Luke Wilson, vice president for law enforcement at Elliptic, a London-based security firm that tracks illicit bitcoin transactions and that counts the U.S. Federal Bureau for Investigations (FBI) among its clients.  Wilson, who used to work at the FBI, where he set up a taskforce to investigate the use of virtual currencies, did not disclose all the ways that Elliptic and law enforcement agencies find criminals using bitcoin. But sometimes, he said, the offenders make as obvious a mistake as withdrawing money from a bitcoin wallet directly into their bank accounts.  More sophisticated criminals use obfuscation methods that make it very hard to be tracked down. One of the most basic ones is a technique known as ""chain-hopping"", whereby money is moved from one cryptocurrency into another, across digital currency exchanges - the less-regulated the better - to create a money trail that is almost impossible to track.  Newer and more complex money-laundering methods have also emerged in recent years, which make it very difficult for law enforcement and bitcoin security firms such as Elliptic or New-York-based Chainalysis to track down cybercriminals.  ""It’s a cat-and-mouse game – as police and companies like Elliptic catch up to criminals’ techniques, they invent new techniques,"" said Jerry Brito, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Coin Center, a not-for-profit advocacy group focusing on public policy issues around cryptocurrency.  These techniques are not foolproof, however - chain-hopping, for example, relies on unregulated exchanges that do not carry out know-your-customer (KYC) checks, and security firms say they will develop ways to trace such methods.  Easier, perhaps, would be for cybercriminals to use next-generation cryptocurrencies that have built-in anonymity from the start, such as Monero, Dash and Z-Cash.  And indeed, experts said late on Tuesday that a computer virus that exploits the same vulnerability as the WannaCry attack had latched on to more than 200,000 computers and begun using them to manufacture - or ""mine"" - Monero currency.  But with a total value of around $425 million - a little over 1 percent of that of bitcoin - converting that currency into spendable cash might not be so easy, and it is also much harder for victims to access, alternative payments experts said.  That is why the Monero attack did not demand a ransom, but rather used the infected computers' computing power to create new currency.  ""This used to happen in bitcoin before it became big – there were loads of botnets that went into computers that used to mine bitcoin, but you now can’t basically mine bitcoin on normal computers because you need specialist hardware,"" said Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin.  Levin said such bitcoin-based attacks were carried out several years ago, when mining it was still largely a hobby for tech geeks using their home computers.  As the bitcoin price has risen and as transaction numbers have grown, the computers have become so specialized that only they can only perform the function of bitcoin mining.  ""If Monero does become adopted and is as big and liquid (as bitcoin), that means the crime (will) move from using computers to mine to getting to extortion,"" Levin said. "

"May 18, 2017 /  9:08 PM / 2 months ago",Blockchain token sale nets $25 million in under 15 minutes,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/aragon-blockchain-funding-idUSL2N1IK29E,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Aragon, a project that creates software to manage companies, has raised $25 million in under 15 minutes late on Wednesday with the sale of its own token, said Luis Cuende, the project's co-founder.  The proceeds were the second-largest amount received by a start-up operating in the blockchain or distributed ledger space, Cuende said. Aragon's coin is called Aragon Network Token.  Cuende, 21, said Aragon is the first management tool developed specifically to decentralize the creation and maintenance of companies around the world.   Aragon was built on ethereum, a public blockchain similar to bitcoin's.  Aragon requires only the internet to function, implementing basic features such as governance, fundraising, payroll and accounting.  ""What we make is software for people to organize themselves and run businesses using blockchain technology,"" said Cuende.   ""They don't have to interact with banks or lawyers if they don't want to. They can be in the field of service they want and they don't have to do all these requirements.""  Cuende, who started his first software project at age 12, did not expect the offering to raise that much money for Aragon.  ""If you had asked me two months ago, $25 million was like five times what I was dreaming of,"" Cuende said in an interview.  The largest funding raised in a so-called ""initial coin offering"" (ICO) was  $150 million in May 2016 by a blockchain solutions company called Slock.it for The DAO, a crowd-funded venture capital fund.   Aragon is one of numerous blockchain start-ups and projects that have raised capital by creating their own tokens or digital currencies and selling them to the public through ICOs.  With the funds raised, Aragon will focus on further developing its software, implementing security audits and hiring additional developers and operational staff, bringing the team to 10 people this year.

"May 17, 2017 /  9:55 PM / 2 months ago",U.S. firm to launch sale of digital token for forex trading,Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-fintechinvestment-blockchain-token-idUSKCN18D2TS,"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Fintech Investment Group, a U.S.-based commodity trading adviser, plans to launch an initial coin offering in June for its own token that allows investors to trade currencies on a digital platform, company founder Alan Friedland said.  The new digital token, to be called Compcoin, is based on a technology that powers bitcoin and litecoin, two of the leading digital currencies. Friedland said 3 million coins, of the total current supply of 10 million, will be sold next month, potentially raising $30 million.  ""With Compcoin, people will be given the opportunity to profit in the new digital token market with a financial instrument that will grow with the performance of the account,"" he said in an interview late on Tuesday.   ""They should make money not only from trading on the platform, but also from the coin's value when it tracks the performance of the account,"" he added.  Initial coin offerings are the current rage among startups in the financial ledger blockchain space, enabling new companies with a technology idea to bypass banks and venture capital firms when raising capital.  In 2016, startups raised about $200 million through ICOs. That amount could double this year, according to market participants.  Compcoin will give investors access to a proprietary, algorithmic foreign currency exchange trading platform called ART, which was developed by Fintech Investment Group.   The company said Compcoin is the first digital token that enables all types of investors access to algorithmic or automated trading in the global currency market. The coin also  allows investors to profit from the price appreciation of the digital token once it starts trading on digital asset exchanges.   Previously, algorithmic trading was available only to institutional investors, hedge fund managers and global banks in big lots and they trade on various currency platforms like Thomson Reuters. They do not need a token to trade currencies on electronic trading platforms, but they usually require huge orders.    Token holders will be able to trade spot foreign exchange and currency futures on the platform.  The new trading platform will trade up to $1 billion in volume, which is equivalent to the total number of Compcoins in the market at 10 million.

"May 18, 2017 /  4:21 PM / 2 months ago",Bitcoin's murkier rivals line up to displace it as cybercriminals' favourite,,http://www.reuters.com/article/cyber-attack-bitcoin-idUSL8N1II1MV,"* Bitcoin's size accounts for popularity among cybercriminals  * Those who do not take extra steps can be traced  * Next-generation cryptocurrencies more secure, still small  By Jemima Kelly  LONDON, May 18 (Reuters) - Bitcoin is well-entrenched as the preferred payment for cybercriminals like the WannaCry hackers who have hit more than 300,000 computers over the past week, but cryptocurrencies offering more anonymity are threatening to displace it.  A key reason for bitcoin's dominance in the nefarious online underworld, say technologists and cybercrime experts, is its size - the total value of all bitcoins in circulation is more than twice that of the nearest of hundreds of rivals.  That makes it easy for victims to access enough to pay the ransoms demanded, and for hackers to cash out of it via online exchanges to spend money in the real world.  Bitcoin was set up in 2008 by someone - or some group - calling themselves Satoshi Nakamoto, and was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and hidden, making traditional financial regulation difficult if not impossible.  Money is sent from one anonymous online ""wallet"" to another with no need for a third party to validate or clear the transactions.  In the WannaCry attack, the addresses of three anonymous bitcoin wallets were given to victims, with a demand for ransom payments from $300 worth of bitcoin, with a promise the affected machines would be decrypted in return, a promise that no evidence has shown will be kept.  But since the way that Bitcoin functions is via the blockchain - a giant, virtually tamper-proof, shared ledger of all bitcoin transactions ever made - payments can be traced, if users do not have the sophistication to take further steps to cloak themselves using digital anonymity tools.  ""In the initial days of bitcoin, people...didn’t realise they were recording for posterity on the blockchain every financial transaction that ever took place,"" said Emin Gun Sirer, a computer science professor at Cornell University.  Bitcoin addresses are anonymous, but users can be traced through IP addresses or by analysing money flows.  If criminals using bitcoin want to stay truly anonymous, Gun Sirer said, they have to go through a number of additional, complex steps to make sure they do not get caught.  It is not yet clear what level of sophistication the WannaCry hackers have when it comes to laundering their cryptocurrency, as none of the money has yet been moved out of the three bitcoin wallets linked to the ransomware, which have had over $80,000 worth of bitcoin paid into them so far. [tmsnrt.rs/2rqaLyz ]  But some have suggested that the fact that the WannaCry hackers demanded bitcoin shows how amateur they are.  ""If it was me, I would want people to use bitcoin all day, because you can trace it,"" said Luke Wilson, vice president for law enforcement at Elliptic, a London-based security firm that tracks illicit bitcoin transactions and that counts the U.S. Federal Bureau for Investigations (FBI) among its clients.  Wilson, who used to work at the FBI, where he set up a taskforce to investigate the use of virtual currencies, did not disclose all the ways that Elliptic and law enforcement agencies find criminals using bitcoin. But sometimes, he said, the offenders make as obvious a mistake as withdrawing money from a bitcoin wallet directly into their bank accounts.  More sophisticated criminals use obfuscation methods that make it very hard to be tracked down. One of the most basic ones is a technique known as ""chain-hopping"", whereby money is moved from one cryptocurrency into another, across digital currency exchanges - the less-regulated the better - to create a money trail that is almost impossible to track.  Newer and more complex money-laundering methods have also emerged in recent years, which make it very difficult for law enforcement and bitcoin security firms such as Elliptic or New-York-based Chainalysis to track down cybercriminals.  ""It’s a cat-and-mouse game – as police and companies like Elliptic catch up to criminals’ techniques, they invent new techniques,"" said Jerry Brito, executive director of the Washington, D.C.-based Coin Center, a not-for-profit advocacy group focusing on public policy issues around cryptocurrency.  These techniques are not foolproof, however - chain-hopping, for example, relies on unregulated exchanges that do not carry out know-your-customer (KYC) checks, and security firms say they will develop ways to trace such methods.  Easier, perhaps, would be for cybercriminals to use next-generation cryptocurrencies that have built-in anonymity from the start, such as Monero, Dash and Z-Cash.  And indeed, experts said late on Tuesday that a computer virus that exploits the same vulnerability as the WannaCry attack had latched on to more than 200,000 computers and begun using them to manufacture - or ""mine"" - Monero currency.  But with a total value of around $425 million - a little over 1 percent of that of bitcoin - converting that currency into spendable cash might not be so easy, and it is also much harder for victims to access, alternative payments experts said.  That is why the Monero attack did not demand a ransom, but rather used the infected computers' computing power to create new currency.  ""This used to happen in bitcoin before it became big – there were loads of botnets that went into computers that used to mine bitcoin, but you now can’t basically mine bitcoin on normal computers because you need specialist hardware,"" said Chainalysis CEO Jonathan Levin.  Levin said such bitcoin-based attacks were carried out several years ago, when mining it was still largely a hobby for tech geeks using their home computers.  As the bitcoin price has risen and as transaction numbers have grown, the computers have become so specialized that only they can only perform the function of bitcoin mining.  ""If Monero does become adopted and is as big and liquid (as bitcoin), that means the crime (will) move from using computers to mine to getting to extortion,"" Levin said. "
"May 17, 2017 /  12:24 AM / 2 months ago",Hackers mint crypto-currency with technique in global 'ransomware' attack,Joseph Menn,http://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-cryptocurrency-idUSKCN18D00W,"SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - A computer virus that exploits the same vulnerability as the global ""ransomware"" attack has latched on to more than 200,000 computers and begun manufacturing digital currency, experts said Tuesday.  The development adds to the dangers exposed by the WannaCry ransomware and provides another piece of evidence that a North Korea-linked hacking group may be behind the attacks.  WannaCry, developed in part with hacking techniques that were either stolen or leaked from the U.S. National Security Agency, has infected more than 300,000 computers since Friday, locking up their data and demanding a ransom payment to release it.  Researchers at security firm Proofpoint said the related attack, which installs a currency “miner” that generates digital cash, began infecting machines in late April or early May but had not been previously discovered because it allows computers to operate while creating the digital cash in the background.  Proofpoint executive Ryan Kalember said the authors may have earned more than $1 million, far more than has been generated by the WannaCry attack.  Like WannaCry, the program attacks via a flaw in Microsoft Corp's (MSFT.O) Windows software. That hole has been patched in newer versions of Windows, though not all companies and individuals have installed the patches.  Digital currencies based on a technology known as blockchain operate by enabling the creation of new currency in exchange for solving complex math problems. Digital ""miners"" run specially configured computers to solve the problems and generate currency, whose value ultimate fluctuates according to market demand.  Bitcoin is by far the largest such currency, but the new mining program is not aimed at Bitcoin. Rather it targeted a newer digital currency, called Monero, that experts say has been pursued recently by North Korean-linked hackers.  North Korea has attracted attention in the WannaCry case for a number of reasons, including the fact that early versions of the WannaCry code used some programming lines that had previously been spotted in attacks by Lazarus Group, a hacking group associated with North Korea.  Security researchers and U.S. intelligence officials have cautioned that such evidence is not conclusive, and the investigation is in its early stages.  In early April, security firm Kaspersky Lab said that a wing of Lazarus devoted to financial gain had installed software to mine Monero on a server in Europe.  A new campaign to mine the same currency, using the same Windows weakness as WannaCry, could be coincidence, or it could suggest that North Korea was responsible for both the ransomware and the currency mining.  Kalember said he believes the similarities in the European case, WannaCry and the miner were ""more than coincidence.""  ""It's a really strong overlap,"" he said. ""It's not like you see Monero miners all over the world.""  The North Korean mission to the United Nations could not be reached for comment, while the FBI declined to comment.
